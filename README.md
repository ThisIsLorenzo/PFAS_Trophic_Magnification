# PFAS Trophic Magnification: A Meta-Analysis 
## Study overview
This repository contains all data, code, and analysis materials for the research study: "*A meta-analysis reveals PFAS concentrations double with each trophic level*".
Our research demonstrates significant biomagnification of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) through food webs, with concentrations doubling at each trophic level.
## Repository structure
### Analysis scipts (/R)
Contains R markdown files (.Rmd) with corresponding HTML outputs documenting the complete analytical workflow, statistical methods, and results interpretation.
### Data files (/Rdata)
Houses all datasets in CSV format used in the analysis.
## Statistical models (/Rmodels)
Contains saved model objects (.RData files) from statistical analyses, allowing for reproducibility and further exploration without recomputation.
## Visualisations (/figs)
Includes all figures generated for the manuscript and supplementary materials in PNG format.
## Data extraction from plots (/metaDigitise)
Contains data extracted from published literature using the metaDigitise software.
