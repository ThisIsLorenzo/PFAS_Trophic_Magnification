Formation of a copolymer was confirmed by variable contact time CP MAS NMR spectroscopy. Macromolecular matrices were significantly enriched in AA with respect to the initial feed composition and we found that the nonfluorinated monomer has a much higher reactivity ratio with respect to VDF. The cumulative concentration, crystallinity, and water affinity of the synthesized copolymers could be modified changing the initial feed composition, the density of the polymerization mixture, the specific interfacial area of the polymer phase, and the polymerization time. The solubility of the macromolecular product in water was greatly affected by its composition. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here we report the distribution of 24 PFASs, total fluorine, and extractable organic fluorine (EOF) in eight different tissues of a killer whale (Orcinus orca) from East Greenland. The sum of target PFAS concentrations was highest in liver (352 ng/g of wet weight) and decreased in the following order: blood > kidney ≈ lung ≈ ovary > skin ≈ muscle ≈ blubber. Most of the EOF consisted of known PFASs in all tissues except blubber, which displayed the highest concentration of EOF, almost none of which was attributed to targeted PFASs. Suspect screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed the presence of additional PFASs but is unlikely to explain the high concentrations of EOF in blubber. While the identity of this unknown organofluorine and its pervasiveness in marine mammals require further investigation, this work suggests that exposure of killer whales to organofluorine substances may be underestimated by determination of legacy PFASs exclusively in liver or blood. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00661,Blood;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Histology;Mammals;Mass spectrometry;Tissue;High resolution mass spectrometry;Fluorine;Marine mammals;Total fluorine;Organofluorine;Organic fluorine;Killer whale;Lipid-rich tissues,NA,NA

The samarium doped ferrite was characterized by XRD, FT-IR, SEM, XPS, UV–vis and VSM. The results revealed the catalyst could be a typical soft magnetic material with a spinel structure, which has uniform particle size (100–200 nm), and good photoresponse in the wavelength range of 200–700 nm. Satisfactory photocatalytic activity of the samarium doped ferrite material was verified, that is the PFOA (0.5 mmol L−1) with degradation efficiency of 48.61% could be achieved in 120 min under UV irradiation at 185 nm. After conducting the cycle experiments, excellent stability and good magnetic recovery performance of the samarium doped ferrite were found. The free radical capture test signified that the h+ and •OH could play major roles in the PFOA initial oxidation, simultaneously. Moreover, possible mechanisms of the PFOA degradation was studied by analyzing the intermediate products using the HPLC method. These results suggest that samarium doped ferrite is a promising photocatalyst in the PFOA wastewater treatment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.optmat.2021.111636,Perfluorooctanoic acid;Magnetic materials;PFOA;Wastewater treatment;Free radicals;Photocatalysis;Particle size;Irradiation;]+ catalyst;Chemical coprecipitation method;Composites material;Ferrite;Ferrite composites;Photocatalytic activity;Photocatalytic degradation;Photodegradation;Precipitation (chemical);Samarium;Samarium doped ferrite;Spinel structure;UV Light;UV-light;XRD,NA,NA

The North Sea and the Baltic Sea have been known as a marine site heavily polluted with organohalogen compounds, and especially with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In this study we wished to determine the current abundance of HNPs in comparison with 2,2', 4,4', 5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153), i.e. the major PCB congener in marine biota. For this purpose, forty blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from seven sites were analyzed on HNPs and PCB 153. Most of the samples contained HNPs in the form of polyhalogenated 1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrroles (PMBPs including Q1) and the mixed halogenated compound MHC-1. In addition we determined several polyhalogenated 1,1'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyrroles (PDBPs), 2,3,4,5-tetrabromo-N-methylpyrrole and several novel homologs, as well as polybrominated N-methylindoles. The occurrence of these HNP groups were considerably different in the samples from different regions with varying sum concentrations up to 1930 mu g/kg lipids in blue mussels from Heligoland (North Sea) and much lower concentrations in samples from the Baltic Sea (up to 13 mu g/kg lipids). The concentrations of HNPs varied by two orders of magnitude, compared to a factor of 10 for PCB 153, suggesting that HNPs are more spatially (and perhaps temporally) variant than POPs. In the North Sea region Heligoland, HNPs were more abundant than PCB 153. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.05.053,character(0),NA,NA

Research focusing on plant uptake of PFOS is very necessary when considering its risk of transfer from soil into food chain. In this work, the uptake of PFOS by wheat (Triticum aestivum L) which is the most main food crop in northern China, was studied. To predict the kinetic uptake limit, the partition-dominated equilibrium sorption of PFOS by roots of wheat was determined. The uptake of PFOS from water at a fixed concentration (1 mu g mL(-1)) increased with exposure time in approach to steady states and the observed uptake was lower than its limit, due presumably to the PFOS dissipation in wheat. The influences of the environmental factors on plant uptake of PFOS were investigated. The concentrations of PFOS measured in the plant compartments increased with increasing salinity (0.03-7.25 psu), temperature (20-30 degrees C) and concentration (0.1-100 mg L-1) at the ranges tested, whereas the maximum uptake of PFOS was found at pH = 6 with increasing pH from 4 to 10. In addition, in all of the cases, the average levels of PFOS detected in the roots were higher than those in the shoots. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study sought to examine the effects of a maternal preconception PFBS exposure on the development of eggs and healthy offspring. Adult female zebrafish received a one-week waterborne exposure of 0.08, 0.14, and 0.25 mg/L PFBS. After which, females were bred with non-exposed males and embryos collected over 5 successful breeding events. PFBS concentrations were detected in levels ranging from 99 to 253 pg/embryo in the first collection but were below the limit of quantitation by fourth and fifth clutches. Therefore, data were subsequently binned into early collection embryos in which PFBS was detected and late collections, in which PFBS was below quantitation. In the early collection, embryo 24 h survival was significantly reduced. In the late collection, embryo development was impacted with unique patterns emerging between Nrf2a wildtype and mutant larvae. Additionally, the impact of nutrient loading into the embryos was assessed through measurement of fatty acid profiles, total cholesterol, and triglyceride content. There were no clear dose-dependent effects, but again unique patterns were observed between the genotypes. Preconception PFBS exposures were found to alter egg and embryo development, which is mediated by direct toxicant loading in the eggs, nutrient loading into eggs, and the function of Nrf2a. These findings provide insight into the reproductive and developmental effects of PFBS and identify maternal preconception as a novel critical window of exposure. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132121,PFAS;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;Sulfonic Acids;Maternal Exposure;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;comparative study;survival;animal tissue;lipid;breeding;adult;genetics;sulfonic acid derivative;embryo development;Embryonic Development;embryo;Fatty acids;human;progeny;cholesterol blood level;fatty acid analysis;linolenic acid;palmitic acid;triacylglycerol blood level;limit of quantitation;zebra fish;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;egg development;transcription factor Nrf2;Zebrafish;fatty acid;cholesterol;cyprinid;Danio rerio;triacylglycerol;embryonic development;Aquifers;lipid storage;Nutrients;yolk sac;genotype;maternal exposure;pancreas islet beta cell;Loading;Aquatic toxicology;Adult females;aquifer pollution;arachidonic acid;Contaminated aquifer;Embryo development;fatty acid desaturation;genotype-environment interaction;Hydrogeology;icosapentaenoic acid;lipid brain level;Nrf2 signaling;nutrient dynamics;nutrient loading;Nutrient loading;Perfluorobutanesulphonic acid;PFBS;Reproductive toxicologies;Reproductive toxicology;swim bladder;transcription factor Nrf2a;Waterborne exposure,NA,NA

Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of studies regarding the hepatotoxic effects of HFPO-TA. Here, we investigated the types and potential mechanisms of liver damage caused by HFPO-TA. Initially, we validated that the introduction of HFPO-TA resulted in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling (W/β signaling) activation, as well as the induction of necroptosis and inflammation, both in the liver of mice and in HepG2 cells. Subsequently, we established that the W/β signaling mediated the necroptosis and inflammation observed in the liver and HepG2 cells exposed to HFPO-TA. Finally, we demonstrated that the phosphorylated form of NF-κB p65 (p-NF-κB p65) played a role in mediating the necroptosis and inflammation, and its activity could be regulated by the W/β signaling pathway in the liver of mice and HepG2 cells exposed to HFPO-TA. In conclusion, our investigation elucidates the role of HFPO-TA in inducing necroptosis and inflammation in the liver, which is facilitated through the activation of the W/β/NF-κB axis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167033,Humans;Article;Liver;male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;pollutant;mouse;Mammals;Perfluorooctanoic acid;pollution exposure;Hexafluoropropylene oxide;liver;oxide;human;industrial chemical;Exposed to;protein function;animal cell;signal transduction;human cell;Hep-G2 cell line;immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein;Chemical activation;liver injury;transcription factor RelA;acid;beta Catenin;Catenin signaling;protein phosphorylation;inflammation;Pathology;3;hepatitis;Inflammation;Cell signaling;3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoate;ammonium 2;beta catenin;canonical Wnt signaling;Hep-g2 cells;hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid;Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid;HFPO-TA;necroptosis;Necroptosis;NF-kappa B;Oligomers;Signaling;trimerization;W/β/NF-κb axis;W/β/NF-κB axis;Wnt protein;Wnt signaling;β-catenin,NA,NA

A specific group of persistent pollutants with distinct hydrophobic/lipophilic characteristics tend to biomagnify (i.e. reaching high concentrations in higher trophic levels) and exhibit low detection rates in water samples. Therefore, within the Water Framework Directive, Environmental Quality Standards were derived for 11 priority compounds and their derivatives. These are to be measured in biota specifically (EQSbiota), in order to assess the risk of secondary poisoning of top predators (including humans) and include hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD), mercury (Hg), brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), dicofol, dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide, fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene. In this PhD, the relevance of the current EQSbiota with regards to ecological quality of aquatic freshwater and brackish ecosystems was evaluated. The study was built around the EQSbiota monitoring in Flanders on 44 sampling locations. The abovementioned compounds and PCBs were analysed in indigenous European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and eel (Anguilla anguilla) in its juvenile ‘yellow eel’ stage. However, benzo(a)pyrene and fluoranthene were analysed in transplanted caged bivalves because of their fast metabolization in fish. Accumulated concentrations were checked for compliance against the current standards and compared to passive sampler data. The main motivation for this PhD was that, despite frequent exceedances of the some EQSbiota (often with a large factor), no apparent effects on the aquatic ecosystem (including secondary poisoning) are reported in literature. Next, two case studies were included on accumulation patterns of Hg and PFAS. In contrast to the other lipophilic compounds, they show a high affinity for proteins.

In this study, the growth rate, photosynthetic activity, oxidative stress and bioaccumulation were investigated using marine algae Chlorella sp. after the exposure of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate acid (PFOS). The results showed that PFOA of <40 mg/L and PFOS of <20 mg/L stimulated algal reproduction, and high doses inhibited the algal growth. The absorbed PFOA and PFOS by algal cells damaged cell membrane and caused metabolic disorder. The photosynthesis activity was inhibited, which was revealed by the significantly reduced maximal quantum yield (Fv/Fm), relative electron transfer rate (rETR) and carbohydrate synthesis. However, the chlorophyll a content increased along with the up-regulation of its encoding genes (psbB and chlB), probably due to an overcompensation effect. The increase of ROS and antioxidant substances (SOD, CAT and GSH) indicated that PFOA and PFOS caused oxidative stress. The BCF of marine algae Chlorella sp. to PFOA and PFOS was calculated to be between 82 and 200, confirming the bioaccumulation of PFOA and PFOS in marine algae. In summary, PFOA and PFOS can accumulate in Chlorella sp. cells, disrupt photosynthesis, trigger oxidative stress and inhibit algal growth. PFOS shows higher toxicity and bioaccumulation than PFOA.

This study collected 25 species of fish with different diets, habitats, and age from the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), the largest deep-water river channel-type reservoir in China, and analyzed the accumulation characteristics of OTs in these fish. The results showed that tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPhT) were the dominant OTs in fish from the TGR. The correlation between OTs concentration and age, body length, and body weight varied with fish species. The concentrations of TBT and TPhT in carnivorous fish (mean, 25.78 and 11.69 ng Sn/g dw, respectively) were higher than those in other diet fish (P<0.01), but there was no significant difference in fish at different habitat water layers (P>0.05). In addition, the degradation rates of TBT and TPhT in different fish species were all below 50%. In summary, the accumulation of TBT and TPhT in fish is mainly influenced by diet, and both TBT and TPhT were difficult to degrade in fish. These results reveal the pollution characteristics of OTs in fish from the TGR, and can improve our understanding of the factors influencing TBT and TPhT accumulation in freshwater fish.",NA,10.1007/s11356-023-31037-y,Animals;Environmental Monitoring;China;metabolism;tributyltin;analysis;Diet;Fishes;Water;Accumulation;Water Pollutants;Chemical;triphenyltin;Trialkyltin Compounds;Organotin Compounds;0;Index Medicus;059QF0KO0R;4XDX163P3D;95T92AGN0V;Fibrinogen;Influence factor;Tributyltin;Triphenyltin,NA,NA

Studies have examined POCs in marine mammals on a regional scale; however, limited data exists on POC concentrations relative to land use and watersheds. Objective: Examine geographical variation of POC concentrations in bottlenose dolphins as it relates to land, and watershed, use. Methods: POC (PCBs, DDTs, and PBDEs) concentrations were measured in blubber of bottlenose dolphins (n = 40) sampled in estuarine waters near Charleston, SC. Photo-identification sighting histories were used to assess the dolphins' use of estuarine waters in two adjacent watersheds (Cooper Subbasin and Stono Subbasin) in the study area and to determine land use (developed, forested, agriculture, and wetland) associations. Results: Dolphins with >= 75% of their sightings in the Cooper Subbasin, which is characterized by a higher degree of developed land use, exhibited higher levels of PCBs, PBDEs, and total pesticides than those with >= 75% of their sightings in the Stono Subbasin. Observed differences were significant for Sigma PBDEs and Sigma DDTs/Sigma PCBs ratio. Significant positive correlations were observed between Sigma PBDEs and developed land use and between Sigma DDTs/Sigma PCBs and wetland land use. A significant negative correlation was observed between Sigma DDTs/Sigma PCBs and developed land use. Conclusion: The spatial pattern of PBDEs and the Sigma DDTs/Sigma PCBs detected in dolphin blubber was shown to vary significantly with adjacent watersheds and land use associations.

Studies suggested that these contaminants may be transferred from mother to child through placenta, increasing concerns for both maternal and child health. This study aimed to investigate the association of maternal consumption of ultra-processed foods with newborn exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the PIPA Project (The Rio Birth Cohort Study on Environmental Exposure and Childhood Development). The pilot cohort study conducted with 131 pregnant women-child pairs in a public maternity school in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was assessed. Maternal dietary intake in the third trimester of pregnancy was evaluated using a qualitative food frequency questionnaire. Food items were classified as non-ultra-processed food and ultra-processed food using the NOVA system and regular consumption of ultra-processed foods was estimated. Newborns of pregnant women who weekly consumed three or more subgroups of ultra-processed food presented the highest level of PFAS (2.47ng/mL; 95%CI: 1.22; 3.72), compared to non-consumption of ultra-processed food investigated (0 ultra-processed food = 1.86ng/mL; 95%CI: 1.38; 2.50). Additionally, cluster analysis grouped ultra-processed food, fish, and PFAS levels.

In this contest, extensive monitoring and surveillance are required to correctly assess the current status of marine environment, paying attention not only to traditional chemical parameters, but also to the so-called ""emerging pollutants"". Among these, marine biotoxins represent a serious hazard, because they can accumulate in fish and mussels and enter the food chain. The detection of marine toxins released by algae has mostly been directed on the analysis of fish/shellfish homogenate rather than seawater samples. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose the re-modeling of ELISA kits to set-up non-automated direct competitive ELIMC (Enzyme- Linked Immuno-Magnetic Colorimetric) assays for the detection of Domoic Acid (DA), Okadaic Acid (OA) and Saxitoxin (STX) in seawater. For each toxin, linear working range, sensitivity and detection limit (0.03, 0.05, 0.01 ng/mL for DA, OA and STX, respectively) of the ELIMC assays were calculated. After evaluation of seawater matrix effect and recovery study, ELIMC assays were integrated within a novel automated networked system (ASMAT - Analytical System for Marine Algal Toxins) based on the micro Loop Flow Reactor (mu LFR) technology, suitable for on-line monitoring of marine toxins. Once established the best operational conditions, ASMAT was calibrated towards DA, OA and STX verifying its capability to detect sub-ppb levels of the target toxins. Analysis of DA, OA and STX in real samples of marine water, sampled in Alonnisos (Greece) were carried out in laboratory using ELIMC assays, ASMAT and ELISA Kits, for a comparative evaluation. Finally, on-line suitability of ASMAT as an early warning alarm system was demonstrated by a field installation within a floating platform in the port of La Spezia (Italy).",NA,10.1016/j.snb.2018.12.083,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,NA,NA

This study provides a systematic assessment of sources, emissions, transportation, and potential risks of the PFAAs in this area.

The distribution of PFAs in the oceans all around the world is well documented. However, the study of PFAs in Xiamen could be a beneficial complement, for its unique geologies of no rivers that originate from other cities to influence the concentration of PFAs in this area. In this paper, six PFAs were analyzed in water, sediments, and organisms from both freshwater and seawater and the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated with the quantity of PFAs in different trophic levels of aquatic organisms. The results showed that the Sigma PFA concentrations ranged from 7.66 to 11.98 ng.L-1 for seawater samples and from 2.12 to 8.61 ng.L-1 for freshwater. The concentration of Sigma PFAs in sediments was 7.43-12.89 ng.g(-1) and 4.53-5.80 ng.g(-1) in seawater and freshwater, respectively. The PFA concentration in water is highly positive correlated with the PFA concentration in sediments (R-2 = 0.85).

Whereas for PFOS regulatory measures are already in force on international level (inclusion in Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants) such activities are missing for PFOA. The environmental concerns of PFOA, which are summarized in the present study, underline the necessity of regulatory measures on an international level for PFOA. Since it seems more likely to agree on a regulation within the European Union first, a regulatory strategy based on the European chemicals regulation REACH (EC No. 1907/2006), is discussed in the present study. Results: PFOA is persistent in the environment, ubiquitous present in surface waters, and subject to long-range transport. It accumulates in biota, especially in top predators. PFOA is increasingly analyzed in food items, and in drinking water. PFOA's intrinsic properties such as its persistency (P), its potential for bioaccumulation (B) and its toxicity (T) suggest that PFOA is a promising candidate for being identified as a Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) under REACH. Because of the dispersive occurrence of PFOA in the environment, the presence in imported products, and the use of PFCs, which can degrade to PFOA in various consumer products, a restriction under REACH seems to be the most effective regulatory measure to minimize human and environmental exposure to PFOA in the European Union. Conclusion: Due to its intrinsic properties, PFOA fulfills the REACH PBT-criteria. The next regulatory step will be the identification of PFOA and its ammonium salt (APFO) as SVHC according to REACH and the addition to the REACH Candidate List. As a second step, a restriction proposal will be prepared to include both substances and precursors into REACH Annex XVII. © 2012 Vierke et al.",NA,10.1186/2190-4715-24-16,Europe;bioaccumulation;pollution exposure;water pollution;toxicity;long range transport;drinking water;organic acid;PFOA;organic pollutant;biodegradation;European Union;Stockholm Convention;PFCs;surface water;salt;PFCAs;Regulation;APFO;Candidate List;Per-and polyfluorinated chemicals;PFO;REACH;Restriction;SVHC,NA,NA

The present study provides a data analysis on PFAS concentrations in the Dutch inland and coastal national waters and fish sampled from 2008 to 2022 and 2015 to 2022, respectively. Although the fish database is relatively small, the water database is unique because of its temporal dimension. It appears that PFAS are omnipresent in Dutch water and fish, with relatively small spatial differences in absolute and relative concentrations (fingerprints) and few obvious temporal trends. Only perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) aqueous concentrations in the rivers Rhine and Scheldt have substantially decreased since 2012. Still, PFOS concentrations exceed the European water quality standards at all and fish standards at many locations. Masses of PFAS entering the country and the North Sea are roughly 3.5 tonnes/year. Generally, the data suggest that most PFAS enter the Dutch aquatic environment predominantly through diffuse sources, yet several major point sources of specific PFAS were identified using fingerprints and monthly concentration profiles as identification tools. Finally, combining concentrations in fish and water, 265 bioaccumulation factors were derived, showing no statistically significant differences between freshwater and marine fish.

Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) are documented to be exposed to increasing concentrations of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), and have been suggested in literature as a key raptor monitoring species. Therefore, non-destructive biomonitoring efforts are of high interest. Thus far, the use of feathers for biomonitoring PFASs in Tawny Owls has not been investigated. In this study, 32 PFASs were analyzed in 49 Tawny Owl body feather samples collected from 2017 to 2020 in Trøndelag, Norway. There were 30 PFASs detected in at least one feather, with the sum concentrations ranging from 31 to 203 ng/g (w.w.). Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) (median: 33 ng/g) and perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (FOSAA) (median: 18 ng/g) were the two compounds with the highest concentrations. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), which is banned for production and use in Norway since 2007, was found in all samples (median: 4.14 ng/g), indicating its high persistence. 8 PFASs were detected in at least 50 % of the samples: FOSAA (11–127 ng/g), PFHpA (<0.04–115 ng/g), perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) (<0.28–21 ng/g), PFOS (0.23–13 ng/g), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) (0.24–5.15 ng/g), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) (<0.28–4.45 ng/g), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) (<0.28–2.33 ng/g), and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA) (0.07–1.01 ng/g). No significant differences were found for the concentrations of PFASs between calendar years and locations, but a slight increase could be observed in the sum concentration of PFASs (Ʃ32PFASs) over the sampling years.

We found that the PFAS alternatives had higher TPT than PFOS and PFOA, such as PFBA vs. PFOA (median: 1.41 vs. 0.73, P < 0.001) and 8:2 Cl-PFESA vs. PFOS (median: 0.98 vs. 0.42, P < 0.001). Moreover, the TPT of 8:2 Cl-PFESA was higher than the precursor, linear and isomeric PFOS, respectively (P < 0.01). Furthermore, we found a U-shaped pattern for TPT in perfluorocarboxylic acid compounds (PFCAs) across different length of carbon chain. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PFAS alternatives may be more easily across the placenta than conventional PFAS. Given the widespread usage of PFAS alternatives, our results indicate that more research is needed to assess the potential health risks of prenatal exposure to PFAS alternatives in children. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135885,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFAS alternatives;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Chromatography;China;Pregnancy;Placenta;Cohort Studies;Blood;body mass;female;fluorocarbon;male;unclassified drug;controlled study;bioaccumulation;chemical substance;Health risks;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;Chlorine compounds;concentration (composition);adult;alkanesulfonic acid;liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Risk assessment;sulfonic acid derivative;human;serum;ultra performance liquid chromatography;infant;cohort analysis;epidemiology;carboxylic acid derivative;priority journal;blood;placental transfer;child health;limit of detection;perfluorobutanoic acid;Perfluorocarboxylic acid;health risk;maternal health;pregnancy;Prenatal exposure;Serum;Guangdong;placenta;umbilical cord blood;pregnant woman;Epidemiological studies;Potential health risks;gestational age;Fetal Blood;maternal serum;butyric acid;fetus;glomerulus filtration rate;fetus blood;Liquid;human serum albumin;Placental transfer;chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid derivative;Maoming;perfluorocarboxylic acid derivative;Trans-placental transfer;Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometries,NA,NA

In the present study, the occurrence of PFAS in selected tissues from pike (Esox lucius L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) collected from two lakes in the Masurian Lake District (Poland) in eastern Europe was addressed. Ten PFAS were analyzed in the tissue of the brain, liver, kidneys, gonads, and muscles by micro-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Only perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorodecanoic acid were detected above the limit of quantification. Concentrations in pike and roach from Ełckie Lake and Hańcza Lake were estimated to be 14/27 and 4.4/3.2 ng/g wet weight, respectively. The contributions of PFOS and PFOA to the sum of PFAS calculated for particular tissues for each fish species were higher than those of the other analyzed compounds: PFOS was found to be predominant in fish from Ełckie Lake, whereas PFOA predominated in fish from Hańcza Lake. It was noted that PFAS concentrations in tissues declined in the following order: kidney > gonads ≈ brain > liver > muscle. The sum of the greatest estimated PFAS concentration was 9.7 ng/g wet weight in kidneys of pike collected from Hańcza Lake. No correlation was noted between PFAS concentration and fish size. The information provided in our study gives a better understanding of the potential dependencies in PFAS distribution and accumulation in biota.

In this study, we compare the sensitivity of three avian species to the toxic effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Eggs of great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis), herring gull (Larus argentatus) and the domestic White Leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) were exposed in ovo by injection into the air sac. Effects on embryo survival were observed following exposure to PFOS and PFOA in chicken and herring gull. Chicken was found to be the most sensitive species with 50 % reduced embryo survival at 8.5 μg/g egg for PFOS and 2.5 μg/g egg for PFOA. Cormorant was shown to be the least sensitive species. The difference in sensitivity between chicken and herring gull was a factor of 2.7 for PFOS and 3.5 for PFOA. Between chicken and great cormorant, the sensitivity difference was 2.6 for PFOS and 8.2 for PFOA. Effects on embryo survival were seen at egg injection doses of PFOS close to levels found in environmental samples from wild birds, indicating that PFOS could be having effects in highly exposed populations of birds.

Mice were fed environmentally relevant concentrations of a PFAS mixture during a period of 10 weeks. The concentrations of the 8 individual PFAS in the mixture were chosen based on measured concentrations in earthworms at a Norwegian skiing area. Our data show high liver accumulation of ∑PFAS in exposed mice, which paralleled significant elevation in body weight and hepatosomatic index (HSI) of male mice. UPC2 -MS/MS analysis in both positive and negative mode, respectively, indicated significant differences between control and exposure groups in the liver of exposed mice. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the features revealed separation of control and exposure groups in both sexes. From the significantly differential 207 lipids, only 72 were identified and shown to belong to eight different lipid classes. PCA of fatty acids (FAs) profile showed a clear separation between control and PFAS exposure groups in both female and male mice, with differential abundant levels of 5 and 4 hydrolyzed FAs, respectively. Transcript and protein analysis of genes associated with lipid homeostasis (ppar-α and β, lxr-α and β, rxr, fasn and srebp) showed that PFAS exposure produced sex- and individual response related alterations. Glutathione reductase (Gr) activity showed exposure-related changes in both female and male mice, compared with controls. Overall, the present study has demonstrated changes in lipid metabolism after PFAS exposure, showing that PFAS accumulation in the liver resulted to hepatotoxic effects, potential interference with membrane lipid profile and homeostasis, and oxidative stress. Given the structural similarity with FAs, interaction between PFAS and nuclear receptors such as PPARs may have severe consequences for general health and physiology in exposed animals and humans. © 2023 The Author(s)",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2023.107838,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;Norway;Fatty Acids;Mice;animal;concentration (parameter);female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;animal tissue;lipid;lipid metabolism;Lipids;mouse;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Mammals;principal component analysis;Principal component analysis;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;oxidative stress;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;toxicity;Fatty acids;mass spectrometry;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha;human;polyfluoroalkyl substance;protein analysis;toxicity testing;analysis;Environmental contamination;enzyme activity;fatty acid;gene expression profiling;lipidomics;Lipidomics;polymer;Control groups;mammal;homeostasis;sterol regulatory element binding protein;Human health;earthworm;lipid homeostasis;Homeostasis;per;Exposure groups;Lipid homeostasis;liver X receptor alpha;liver X receptor beta;lxra gene;Male mouse;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta;PFAS mixture;Polyfluoroalkyl substance mixture;ppara gene;pparb gene;Principal-component analysis;retinoid X receptor;rxr gene;Ski product;Ski products;srebp gene,NA,NA

Persistent organohalogen pollutants, such as perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), may interfere with thyroid homeostasis and thus exposures to these compounds might represent risk factors for neurologic and cognitive abnormalities. In this study, serum specimens collected from thirty-one licensed anglers in New York State were analyzed for levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). PFOS and PFOA occurred in the highest concentrations with geometric means of 19.6 ng/mL (95% CI 16.3-23.5) and 1.3 ng/mL (95% CI 1.2-1.5), respectively. In a cross-sectional analysis, no statistically significant associations were detected for PFCs, or their sum, with TSH or FT4 at α = 0.05. However, post hoc power analyses, though limited, suggested that moderate increases in sample size, to 86 and 129 subjects, might facilitate 80% power to detect statistically significant associations for FT4 and PFDA (β = 0.09) and PFUnDA (β = 0.08), respectively. The consumption of sportfish may have contributed to PFDA (r = 0.52, P = 0.003) and PFUnDA (r = 0.40, P = 0.025) levels. This preliminary study does not indicate associations between non-occupational PFCs exposures and thyroid function. However, the possibility for weak associations for FT4 with PFDA and PFUnDA, PFCs measured in low concentrations, is raised. Given the ubiquity of PFCs in the environment and the importance of thyroid function to neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive endpoints, a confirmatory study is warranted. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Prenatal exposure to PFNA negatively impacts survival and development of mice and activates the mouse and human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR). In the current study, we used PPAR knockout (KO) and 129S1/SvlmJ wild-type (WT) mice to investigate the role of PPAR in mediating PFNA-induced in vivo effects. Pregnant KO and WT mice were dosed orally with water (vehicle control: 10ml/kg), 0.83, 1.1, 1.5, or 2mg/kg PFNA on gestational days (GDs) 1-18 (day of sperm plug = GD 0). Maternal weight gain, implantation, litter size, and pup weight at birth were unaffected in either strain. PFNA exposure reduced the number of live pups at birth and survival of offspring to weaning in the 1.1 and 2mg/kg groups in WT. Eye opening was delayed (mean delay 2.1 days) and pup weight at weaning was reduced in WT pups at 2mg/kg. These developmental endpoints were not affected in the KO. Relative liver weight was increased in a dose-dependent manner in dams and pups of the WT strain at all dose levels but only slightly increased in the highest dose group in the KO strain. In summary, PFNA altered liver weight of dams and pups, pup survival, body weight, and development in the WT, while only inducing a slight increase in relative liver weight of dams and pups at 2mg/kg in KO mice. These results suggest that PPAR is an essential mediator of PFNA-induced developmental toxicity in the mouse. Copyright © 2010 Cynthia J.

PFCs have been detected in serum and liver of avian wildlife worldwide. While the molecular mechanisms have yet to be elucidated in detail, PFCs alter lipid metabolism through peroxisome proliferation, xenobiotic metabolism by activating the cytochrome: P450 (CYP) system, and serum cholesterol levels by inducing or repressing key genes. Here, we employed a simple messenger RNA (mRNA) screening method using quantitative PCR to assess the effects of PFCs on mRNA expression in chicken embryo hepatocytes (CEH). CEH cultures were treated with perfluoroalkyl sulfonates and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates of varying chain lengths and linear or technical grade potassium perfluoro-1-octane sulfonate (L-PFOS and T-PFOS). T-PFOS comprised 80% perfluorooctane sulfonate isomers (62% linear) and various PFCs and inorganic salts. Relative mRNA expression levels of the following genes were examined: acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), liveir fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), CYP1A4/1A5 and CYP4B1, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2). Compared to L-PFOS, T-PFOS altered the mRNA expression level of more genes and produced greater fold changes. L-FABP was upregulated by PFCs greater than or equal to eight carbons, while CYPs were upregulated by PFCs less than or equal to eight carbons. ACOX, HMG-CoA, and SREBP2 showed little to no change following PFC exposure. This study is the first to expose CEH cultures to multiple PFCs in vitro and demonstrates that exposure to PFC solutions of different isomeric content or chain length causes variable transcriptional responses.",NA,10.1093/toxsci/kfp160,"Chickens;Hepatocytes;Messenger;RNA;RNA, Messenger",NA,NA

In this study we UV-irradiated Q1 in order to produce hexahalogenated 1'-methylbipyrroles (Cl-6-MBPs). Q1 was transformed with half-lives of <5 min. Already after 5 min, all of the five existing Cl-6-MBPs (HI-H5) were detected in the irradiated sample. Only one Cl-6-MBP (2,3,3',4',5,5'-hexachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP-77, H2) has been previously described in the literature. H5 was identified as 2,3,3,4,4,5'-hexachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP-75) by a specific fragment ion detected by GC/ECNI-MS. Fractionations of the irradiation mixture by reversed-phase HPLC followed by H-1 NMR analysis led to the structure of H4, i.e. 2,3,3,4,4',5-hexachloro-l-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP-74). H1 andH3 showed virtually identical H-1 NMR data. Therefore, it could not determined which of either isomers is 2,3,3',4,5,5'-hexachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP-76) and which is 2,3,4,4',5,5'-hexachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP-78). In addition, two pentachloro-MBPs (P1 and P3) could be traced back to MBP-62 and MBP-69. Cl-6-MBPS were analyzed in whale blubber from Australia and skua adipose tissue from Antarctica. The marine mammals contained all Cl-6-MBPs except for the most abundant in the irradiation experiment. The concentrations of the Cl-6-MBPs amounted to 0.04-1.76% of the concentration of Q1. The highest concentrations Of Cl-6-MBP isomers in the biota samples were found for MBP-76, MBP-77, and MBP-78. These congeners appeared to be the most lipophilic ones owing to the highest retention time in RP-HPLC. Nevertheless, it remained unclear whether the Cl-6-MBPs were actual halogenated natural products or environmental metabolites of Q1. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

PFASs are commonly detected in foods and food-contact materials (FCMs), including fast food packaging and microwave popcorn bags. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to investigate associations between serum PFASs and consumption of restaurant food and popcorn in a representative sample of Americans. METHODS: We analyzed 2003–2014 serum PFAS and dietary recall data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used multivariable linear regressions to investigate relationships between consumption of fast food, restaurant food, food eaten at home, and microwave popcorn and serum levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoro-hexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). RESULTS: Calories of food eaten at home in the past 24 h had significant inverse associations with serum levels of all five PFASs; these associations were stronger in women. Consumption of meals from fast food/pizza restaurants and other restaurants was generally associated with higher serum PFAS concentrations, based on 24-h and 7-d recall, with limited statistical significance. Consumption of popcorn was associated with significantly higher serum levels of PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, and PFOS, based on 24-h and 12-month recall, up to a 63% (95% CI: 34, 99) increase in PFDA among those who ate popcorn daily over the last 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between serum PFAS and popcorn consumption may be a consequence of PFAS migration from microwave popcorn bags. Inverse associations between serum PFAS and food eaten at home—primarily from grocery stores—is consistent with less contact between home-prepared food and FCMs, some of which contain PFASs.

A wider range of geographical locations (e.g., South America, Russia, Antarctica) and habitats (e.g., high-mountain lakes, deep-ocean, and offshore waters) have been investigated in recent years enabling a better understanding of the global distribution of PFCs in aquatic organisms. High concentrations of PFCs continue to be detected in invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is still the predominant PFC detected (mean concentrations up to 1900 ng/g ww) in addition to important concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; sum PFCAs up to 400 ng/g ww). More studies have evaluated the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these compounds in both freshwater and marine food webs. Several reports have indicated a decrease in PFOS levels over time in contrast to PFCA concentrations that have tended to increase in tissues of aquatic organisms at many locations. The detection of precursor metabolites and isomers has become more frequently reported in environmental assessments yielding important information on the sources and distribution of these contaminants. The integration of environmental/ecological characteristics (e.g., latitude/longitude, salinity, and/or trophic status at sampling locations) and biological variables (e.g., age, gender, life cycle, migration, diet composition, growth rate, food chain length, metabolism, and elimination) are essential elements in order to adequately study the environmental fate and distribution of PFCs and should be more frequently considered in study design.

To do so, blood from 112 adult glaucous gulls were sampled during the breeding seasons of 2015 until 2019 in Bjørnøya and Kongsfjorden. We measured plasma concentrations of OHCs including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs). Feather stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) were analyzed to indicate trophic level and feeding habitat, respectively. Body burdens of OHCs differed significantly between the two populations for all 5 sampling years. Overall, the population at Bjørnøya had plasma concentrations of OHCs 5.3 times higher than the Kongsfjorden population. The most quantitatively abundant contaminants found in the glaucous gulls were ΣPCBs and ΣPFASs in Bjørnøya and ∑PCBs in Kongsfjorden. No differences in relative trophic position between both breeding populations were reported although Kongsfjorden individuals varied significantly in δ15N across sampling years, while Bjørnøya individuals remained stable over time. In addition, we highlighted no relationship between plasma OHCs and feather δ15N (trophic position) although the lack of association might be due to both tissues (i.e blood and feathers) reflecting different time scales.

In the present study we investigated influences of protein on the bioaccumulation of six kinds of PFASs by Daphnia magna in water; it included perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, and perfluorododecanoic acid. Two types of protein including bovine albumin from animal and soy peptone from plant were compared and the effects of protein concentration were investigated. Both types of protein at high concentrations (10 and 20 mg L-1) suppressed the bioaccumulation of PFASs. When protein concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg L-1, the decreasing ratios of the PFAS body burden (35.3-52.9%) in Daphnia magna induced by bovine albumin were significantly higher than those (22.0-36.6%) by soy peptone. The dialysis bag experiment results showed that the binding of PFASs to protein followed the Freundlich isotherm, suggesting it is not a linear partitioning process but an adsorption-like process. The partition coefficients of PFASs between bovine albumin and water were higher compared to soy peptone; this resulted in higher reducing rates of freely dissolved concentrations of PFASs with increasing bovine albumin concentration, leading to a stronger suppression of PFAS bioaccumulation. However, the presence of both types of protein with a low concentration (1 mg L-1) enhanced the bioaccumulation of PFASs. Furthermore, the water-based bioaccumulation factor based on the freely dissolved concentrations of PFASs even increased with and the depuration rate constants of PFASs from Daphnia magna decreased with protein concentration, suggesting that protein would not only reduce the bioavailable concentrations and uptake rates of PFASs but also lower the elimination rates of PFASs in Daphnia magna. Because these two opposite effects would change with different protein concentrations in water, the net effect of protein on PFAS bioaccumulation would also vary with protein concentration. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/es401442y,Biochemistry;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Bioaccumulation;Fatty Acids;Bovine;Serum Albumin;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;bioaccumulation;protein;Mammals;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;concentration (composition);adsorption;article;organofluorine derivative;perfluorononanoic acid;Perfluorononanoic acids;protein binding;organic compound;Proteins;Daphnia;Daphnia magna;dissolved organic matter;partition coefficient;peptone;Peptones;Fresh Water;Water Pollutants;bovine serum albumin;Chemical;Bioaccumulation factor;Rate constants;Bioavailable concentrations;crustacean;Freely dissolved concentration;Protein concentrations;Soybean Proteins,NA,NA

The largest degree of isotope fractionation is expected to occur for deuterium in CH3Cl in the hydrogen abstraction reactions with its main sink reactant tropospheric OH and its minor sink reactant Cl atoms. We determined the isotope fractionation by stable hydrogen isotope analysis of the fraction of CH3Cl remaining after reaction with hydroxyl and chlorine radicals in a 3.5 m(3) Teflon smog chamber at 293 +/- 1 K. We measured the stable hydrogen isotope values of the unreacted CH3Cl using compound-specific thermal conversion isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The isotope fractionations of CH3Cl for the reactions with hydroxyl and chlorine radicals were found to be -264 +/- 45 and -280 +/- 11 parts per thousand, respectively. For comparison, we performed similar experiments using methane (CH4) as the target compound with OH and obtained a fractionation constant of -205 +/- 6 parts per thousand which is in good agreement with values previously reported.

Understanding of PFAS alternatives is limited, and few studies have reported joint associations of PFASs and PFAS alternatives. Objectives: To investigate associations of novel PFAS alternatives (chlorinated perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids, Cl-PFESAs and perfluorobutanoic acid, PFBA) and two legacy PFASs (Perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFOS) with glucose-homeostasis markers and explore joint associations of 13 legacy and alternative PFASs with the selected outcomes. Methods: We used cross-sectional data of 1,038 adults from the Isomers of C8 Health Project in China. Associations of PFASs and PFAS alternatives with glucose-homeostasis were explored in single-pollutant models using generalized linear models with natural cubic splines for PFASs. Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) models were applied to assess joint associations of exposures and outcomes. Sex-specific analyses were also conducted to evaluate effect modification. Results: After adjusting for confounders, both legacy (PFOA, PFOS) and alternative (Cl-PFESAs and PFBA) PFASs were positively associated with glucose-homeostasis markers in single-pollutant models. For example, in the total study population, estimated changes with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of fasting glucose at the 95th percentile of 6:2Cl-PFESA and PFOS against the thresholds were 0.90 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.21) and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.62). Positive joint associations were found in BKMR models with 6:2Cl-PFESA contributing most. Sex-specific associations existed in both single- and multi-pollutant models. Conclusions: Legacy and alternative PFASs were positively associated with glucose-homeostasis markers. 6:2Cl-PFESA was the primary contributor. Sex-specific associations were also identified. These results indicate that joint associations and effect modification should be considered in risk assessment. However, further studies are recommended to strengthen our findings and to elucidate the mechanisms of action of legacy and alternative PFASs. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106913,Pollution;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFAS alternatives;exposure;PFASs;Article;Sulfonic Acids;China;Diabetes;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;unclassified drug;sex difference;biomarker;pollutant;alkyl group;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;sulfonic acid derivative;human;Adult;aged;epidemiology;blood sampling;insulin;glucose blood level;glucose;perfluorobutanoic acid;Cross-Sectional Studies;cross-sectional study;Isomers;human experiment;homeostasis;Bayes theorem;Bayes Theorem;outcome assessment;Confidence interval;diabetes;glucose homeostasis;homeostasis model assessment;Homeostasis;Glucose;Bayesian;Bayesian network;Polyfluoroalkyl substance alternative;Chinese;fasting;Glucose homeostasis;Glucose-homeostasis marker;Health projects;Multipollutant;perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid;Sex-specific,NA,NA

The effects of source water composition (humic acids [HA] and cations [Ca2+ and Mg2+]) on PFOS and PFOA removal efficiency by the functionalized membrane were determined. PAH/PAA modification resulted in approximately 38 % and 9.2 % reduction in membrane molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) and porosity, respectively, leading to approximately 30 % increase in the removal of PFOS and PFOA primarily due to size exclusion. The presence of only HA led to 10–12 % higher removal of PFOS/A when compared to DI water; however, an increase in HA concentration did not further influence their removal efficiency. The coexistence of cations and HA resulted in significantly higher removal of PFOS and PFOA (up to 23 % higher for PFOS). Further enhancement of PFOS removal (14 % higher) was observed when cation concentrations were doubled, attributable to the interactions of PFOS/A with the source water components and the functionalized membrane, resulting in enhanced size and charge exclusion of macromolecular complexes including PFOS-cation-PFOS, PFOS-cation-HA, and PFOA-cation-HA. © 2021 The Author(s)",NA,10.1016/j.hazl.2021.100043,PFOS;PFOA;Ultrafiltration;PAH/PAA;Polyelectrolyte;Sulfones;Sulfonic Acids,NA,NA

This study was designed to investigate whether a phycoerythrin-derived peptide of Pyropia yezoensis (PYP) reduces PFOS-induced ER stress associated with calcium dysregulation. The protective effects of PYP were determined by cell viability, immunoblotting for ER stress response protein glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and calcium-dependent protein kinases in rat frontal cortical neurons. PFOS-induced decrease in cell viability was attenuated by PYP pretreatment (1 μg/mL) for 24 h, which was downregulated by inhibiting tropomyosin-receptor kinase B (TrkB). PYP pretreatment downregulated the increase in intracellular calcium levels and phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and c-Jun N-terminal kinase which are associated with a PFOS-induced increase in GRP78. The PFOS-induced increase in GRP78 was downregulated via activation of TrkB receptor-linked extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) by PYP pretreatment. Moreover, PYP microinjections (1 μg/kg, 0.54 nmol) attenuated the GRP78 expression in rat prefrontal cortex caused by PFOS (10 mg/kg) exposure for 2 weeks. These findings demonstrate that PYP enhances frontal cortical neuron viability via activation of TrkB receptor-ERK1/2 signaling and attenuation of ER stress in rat prefrontal cortex against PFOS exposure, suggesting that PYP might prevent neuronal dysfunctions caused by PFOS-induced ER stress. © 2018 by the authors.",NA,10.3390/md16020044,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Pregnancy;Rats;animal;female;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;chemistry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;drug effect;embryo;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;metabolism;animal cell;rat;protein expression;signal transduction;calcium;Calcium;nerve cell;Neurons;neuroprotection;pregnancy;cell survival;Cell Survival;cell viability;protein protein interaction;Persistent organic pollutant;calcium homeostasis;enzyme inhibition;Brain Chemistry;calcium cell level;immunoblotting;Calcium Signaling;protein kinase;microinjection;endoplasmic reticulum stress;prefrontal cortex;Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress;seaweed;mitogen activated protein kinase 1;stress activated protein kinase;calcium signaling;MAPK signaling;neuroprotective agent;antagonists;brain chemistry;brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor;calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II;calcium dependent protein kinase;Endoplasmic reticulum stress;enzyme phosphorylation;frontal cortex;glucose regulated protein 78;heat shock protein;Heat-Shock Proteins;Hspa5 protein;inhibitors;ionomycin;MAP Kinase Signaling System;nerve cell lesion;peptide derivative;phycoerythrin;Phycoerythrin;Phycoerythrin-derived peptide;Prefrontal Cortex;primary cell culture;Primary Cell Culture;Pyropia yezoensis;Pyropia yezoensis phycoerythrin peptide;Receptor;receptor down regulation;red alga;Seaweed;trkB;Sulfones;C-Peptide,NA,NA

The speed and labor efficiency of N-15 determinations from aqueous solutions such as soil solutions or soil extracts are often limited by sample preparation. Several procedures for the conversion of dissolved ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate NO3- to gaseous ammonia and its subsequent trapping in acidified traps have been elaborated in the last decades. They are based on the use of acidified filters kept either above the respective solution or in floating PTFE envelopes. in this paper, we present an improved diffusion method with a fixed PTFE trap. The diffusion containers are continuously kept in a vertical rotary shaker. Quantitative diffusion can thus be achieved in only three days. For solutions with NH4+ levels of only 1 mg N kg(-1) and NO3- concentrations of 12 mg N kg(-1), recovery rates of 98.8-102% were obtained. By addition of N-15 labeled and non-labeled NH4+ and NO3- it was shown that no cross-contamination from NH4+ to NO3- or vice versa takes place even when one form is labeled to more than 1 at %N-15 while the other form has natural N-15 content.

Recent studies indicate that known PFCAs and PFSAs accounted for 5-95% of the organofluorine (OF) in human and wild rat blood samples suggesting that a relatively large proportion of OF remained unknown. Until recently, some studies reported commercially available compounds such as polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diesters (diPAPs) and fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTSAs) in human blood and sludge samples. The present investigation is a pilot study aiming at surveying some newly identified PFASs such as diPAPs, FTSAs, and perfluorinated phosphinates (PFPiAs) in different environmental samples including surface water, sediment, sewage treatment plant influent and effluent, sludge, benthic worm, and human blood from Hong Kong. DiPAPs (6:2, 6:2/8:2, and 8:2) were detected in some of the samples at part-per-billion (ppb) levels in sludge, sub ppb levels in influent and effluent, sediment, worm, and human blood samples, and sub part-per-trillion (ppt) levels in surface waters. Sub ppt to ppb levels of 6:2 and 8:2 FTSAs were observed in worm, surface water, and human blood samples. PFPiAs were only observed in worm samples. The detected ""new PFASs"" accounted for a minor proportion (less than 5%) of the total PFASs in benthic worm and human blood, but up to 95% in sewage sludge samples from Hong Kong.

Due to their widespread usages, persistence in the environment, and bioaccumulation in animals and humans, great public health concerns have been raised on adverse health risks of PFAS. In this study, ten PFAS were selected according to their occurrence in different water bodies. The wild-type worms were exposed to individual PFAS at 0, 0.1, 1,10, 100, and 200 μM, and the toxic effects of PFAS on growth, development, fecundity, and behavior at different life stages were investigated using a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform. Our results showed that perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), 1H,1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetic acid (NEtFOSAA), perfluorobutanesulfonic (PFBS), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) exhibited significant inhibitive effects on the growth in the L4 larva and later stages of worms with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 200 μmol/L. PFOS and PFBS significantly decreased the brood size of worms across all tested concentrations (p < 0.05), and the most potent PFAS is PFOS with BMC of 0.02013 μM (BMCL, 1.6e-06 μM). During adulthood, all PFAS induced a significant reduction in motility (p < 0.01), while only PFOS can significantly induce behavior alteration at the early larvae stage. Furthermore, the adverse effects occurred in larval stages were found to be the most susceptible to the PFAS exposure. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential adverse effects associated with PFAS exposure and show the importance of considering developmental stages in toxicity assessments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122429,Biochemistry;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;Bioaccumulation;animal;Cell proliferation;concentration (parameter);fluorocarbon;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;alkyl group;Health risks;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;sulfonic acid derivative;toxicity;Toxicity;hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid;human;Adult;young adult;growth rate;polyfluoroalkyl substance;chemical analysis;toxicological parameters;perfluorobutanoic acid;toxicity testing;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;Commercial applications;sulfonamide;Industrial chemicals;brood size;fertility;developmental stage;Adverse effect;high throughput screening;body growth;Caenorhabditis elegans;fluorotelomer sulfonic acid;Per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances;1h;2h;2h perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetic acid;Behavior;behavior assessment;Development;fluorotelomer derivative;Health concerns;High throughput screening;High-throughput screening;nematode,NA,NA

Strains PrS3 and PrS14 showed maximum bacterial growth using para-cetamol as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. On the contrary, the highest %organic carbon removal efficiency was exhibited by PrS10. The isolates were identified as non-identical and related to the Pseudomonas genus by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The spectrometric assay indicated PrS10 with the highest paracetamol degradation potential (96.37% removal in 7 days), whereas the GC-MS study confirmed 92.35% paracetamol degradation efficiency. The influence of different carbohydrates on paracetamol degradation indicated a competition between monosaccharide and paracetamol as an energy source for PrS10 and reduced degradation efficiency.

Most human exposure to environmental contaminants, including PFAAs, occurs through consumption of contaminated food or drinking water. This study uses PFAA data from meat samples collected from recreationally harvested American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in South Carolina to assess potential dietary exposure of hunters and their families to PFAAs. Consumption patterns were investigated using intercept surveys of 23 hunters at a wild game meat processor. An exposure scenario using the average consumption frequency, portion size, and median perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) concentration in alligator meat from all hunt units found the daily dietary exposure to be 2.11 ng/kg body weight per day for an adult human. Dietary PFOS exposure scenarios based on location of harvest suggested the highest daily exposure occurs with alligator meat from the Middle Coastal hunt unit in South Carolina. Although no samples were found to exceed the recommended threshold for no consumption of PFOS found in Minnesota state guidelines, exposure to a mixture of PFAAs found in alligator meat and site-specific exposures based on harvest location should be considered in determining an appropriate guideline for vulnerable populations potentially exposed to PFAAs through consumption of wild alligator meat. © 2017",NA,10.1016/j.jes.2017.05.046,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Meat;Food Contamination;United States;animal;fluorocarbon;food contamination;environmental monitoring;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;diet;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;South Carolina;surfactant;Meats;human;dietary exposure;Dietary Exposure;Dietary exposure;Potable water;metabolism;meat;food consumption;analysis;health risk;health impact;food quality;guideline;statistics;Alligators;Crocodiles;crocodilian;Consumption advisories;Consumption advisory;numerical data;Alligator;Alligator mississippiensis;American alligators;Harvesting;American alligator;Contaminant consumption;Public hunt;vulnerability,NA,NA

A comprehensive review about ECs including the occurrence and ecotoxicity, as well as the controlling strategies was made. Firstly, the idea of ECs ”block” was introduced to connect different ECs during the supply of feed and food chain. The existence of ECs in different contaminant blocks would eventually affect human health. Secondly, the conventional strategies including physical, chemical, and biological methods against ECs were presented such as the removal of PPCPs and PAHs. Notably, conventional strategies like filtration, adsorption, and sedimentation could hardly eliminate the parent compound of ECs. Last but not least, the biological strategies employed by the oxidoreductases (ORs) group like lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, laccase, and horseradish peroxidase were also evaluated for ECs elimination. Although the elimination of pharmaceuticals by the lignin peroxidase and laccase in lab-scale are gratifying, the removal of other ECs like PAHs, and PFCs are still insufficient by the ORs family. All in all, a combination of conventional strategies with enzymatic-based catalysis would greatly integrate the advantages and allow a promising, efficient, and eco-friendly controllable solution to ECs decontamination.",NA,10.1016/j.jece.2022.108211,character(0),NA,NA

In the current study, we investigate the effect of HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) belinostat at clinically relevant concentration on nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and mitochondrial metabolism for the treatment of KRAS-mutant human lung cancer. LC-MS metabolomic study of belinostat on mitochondrial metabolism was performed in G12C KRAS-mutant H358 non-small cell lung cancer cells. Furthermore, l-methionine (methyl-C-13) isotope tracer was used to explore the effect of belinostat on one-carbon metabolism. Bioinformatic analyses of metabolomic data were performed to identify the pattern of significantly regulated metabolites. To study the effect of belinostat on redox signaling ARE-NRF2 pathway, luciferase reporter activity assay was done in stably transfected HepG2-C8 cells (containing pARE-TI-luciferase construct), followed by qPCR analysis of NRF2 and its target gene in H358 cells, which was further confirmed in G12S KRAS-mutant A549 cells. Metabolomic study reveals significantly altered metabolites related to redox homeostasis, including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites (citrate, aconitate, fumarate, malate, and alpha-ketoglutarate); urea cycle metabolites (Arginine, ornithine, argino-succinate, aspartate, and fumarate); and antioxidative glutathione metabolism pathway (GSH/GSSG and NAD/NADH ratio) after belinostat treatment. C-13 stable isotope labeling data indicates potential role of belinostat in creatine biosynthesis via methylation of guanidinoacetate. Moreover, belinostat downregulated the expression of NRF2 and its target gene NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), indicating anticancer effect of belinostat is mediated, potentially via Nrf2-regulated glutathione pathway. Another HDACi panobinostat also showed potential anticancer effect in both H358 and A549 cells via Nrf2 pathway.

The method included a concentration step using solid phase extraction (SPE) approach in combination with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system (LC-MS/MS). This method was optimized and validated for the common PFAS contaminants in drinking water. An initial demonstration of capability was established with an acceptable initial calibration, minimum reporting limit (MRL), limit of detection (LOD), initial demonstration of low system background, and initial demonstration of precision (IDP). Isotopically labeled internal standards were used for quantification. Surrogate standards were used to monitor method performance. The current method will help in better understanding of PFAS crisis by providing an efficient measurement of PFAS in water. In this study, the recoveries of four surrogates were between 84 and 113%, and calculated limit of detection (DL) and minimum reporting limits (MRL) were generally 1.0–3.0 and 5–10 ng/L, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",NA,10.1007/s00128-022-03686-1,PFAS;Fluorocarbons;Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry;Chromatography;High Pressure Liquid;fluorocarbon;water pollutant;Extraction;LC-MS/MS;Liquid chromatography;Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry;Mass spectrometry;Phase separation;high performance liquid chromatography;liquid chromatography;Polyfluorinated alkyl substances;procedures;solid phase extraction;Solid Phase Extraction;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Solid-phase extraction;drinking water;Potable water;Drinking Water;Analysis;Water;Water Pollutants;Limit of detection;Chemical;Liquid;Drinking water;Analyse;Demonstrations;Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system;Minimum reporting limit;Minimum reporting limit (MRL);Parts per trillion;Spectrometry systems;Drinking,NA,NA

This study examined the effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in white leghorn hatchlings on various developmental, immunological, and clinical health parameters. In addition, serum PFOS concentrations were determined by LC/MS/MS. Embryonic day (ED) 0 eggs were injected with either safflower oil/10% DMSO (control, 0 mg/kg egg wt) or PFOS in safflower oil/10% DMSO at 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg egg wt, and the chicks were grown to post-hatch day (PHD) 14. Treatment with PFOS did not affect hatch rate. Following in ovo exposure chicks exhibited increases in spleen mass at all treatment levels, in liver mass at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg egg wt, and in body length (crown-rump length) at the 5 mg/kg treatment. Right wings were shorter in all treatments compared to control. Increases in the frequency of brain asymmetry were evident in all treatment groups. SRBC-specific immunoglobulin (IgM and IgY combined) titers were decreased significantly at all treatment levels, while plasma lysozyme activity was increased at all treatment levels. The PHA skin test response decreased in relation to increasing PFOS dose. Serum concentrations where significant immunological, morphological, and neurological effects were observed at the lowest dose (1 mg/kg egg wt) averaged 154 ng PFOS/g serum. These concentrations fall within environmental ranges reported in blood samples from wild caught avian species; thereby, verifying that the environmental egg concentrations used for the injections do indeed relate to serum levels in hatchlings that are also environmentally relevant. These data indicate that immune alterations and brain asymmetry can occur in birds following in ovo exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOS and demonstrates the need for further research on the developmental effects of perfluorinated compounds in various species. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.reprotox.2008.10.009,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Animals;Ovum;Chickens;Liver;Chick Embryo;nonhuman;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;chicken;animal tissue;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;Embryonic Development;embryo;Gallus gallus;hatching;article;Bird;lysozyme;liver weight;Aves;enzyme activity;developmental disorder;Spondias purpurea;Immune;In ovo;Cholesterol;immunoglobulin Y;Organ Size;Embryo;ALT;body height;brain asymmetry;Brain asymmetry;brain development;brain malformation;Carthamus tinctorius;Crown-Rump Length;Developmental;Embryonic;immunoglobulin M;immunopathology;Spleen;spleen size;Wing;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;Nonmammalian;Abnormalities;Drug-Induced;Sulfones;European Continental Ancestry Group,NA,NA

Recent evidence showed that PFOS could induce apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. However, the apoptotic mechanisms induced by PFOS as well as the possible relationship between apoptosis and other PFOS-induced endpoints, remain unclear. In the present study, normal human-hamster hybrid (AL) cells and mtDNA-depleted (ρ0 AL) cells were exposed to PFOS, and assayed for cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and apoptosis (caspase-3/7, caspase-9 activities). Our results showed that PFOS decreased cell viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in AL cells, but not in ρ0 AL cells. However, long-term exposure to PFOS failed to induce the mutagenic effects at the CD59 locus in AL cells. Exposure to 200 μM PFOS significantly increased the activities of caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 in AL cells, but the activities of these caspases were not affected in ρ0 AL cells. In addition, PFOS increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide anion (O2-), as well as nitric oxide (NO), and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) at the concentrations of 100 and 200μM in AL cells. On the other hand, exposure to PFOS had no effect on intracellular ROS, O2-, and NO production in ρ0 AL cells. Caspase-3/7 activity, which was increased by 200 μM PFOS, could be suppressed by ROS/O2- scavengers and nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) inhibitors in AL cells. These results implicate that PFOS-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress is mediated by a mitochondrion-dependent pathway and that the induction of apoptosis might be a protective function against mutagenesis in AL cells exposed to PFOS. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2013.04.004,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Animals;Cell Line;nonhuman;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;oxidative stress;human;article;priority journal;animal cell;cell protection;CD59 antigen;enzyme activity;drug cytotoxicity;human cell;caspase 3;cell viability;Mitochondria;mitochondrion;concentration (parameters);apoptosis;Apoptosis;Oxidative stress;gene locus;nitric oxide;Nitric Oxide;reactive oxygen metabolite;Reactive Oxygen Species;intracellular membrane;Cricetinae;mutagenicity;hamster;Mutagenicity;caspase 9;caspase 7;Free Radical Scavengers;Membrane Potential;Mitochondrial;mitochondrial membrane potential;hybrid cell;Hybrid Cells;mitochondrial DNA;MtDNA-depleted (ρ<sup>0</sup>) A<sub>L</sub> cells;Mutagens;reactive nitrogen species;superoxide;Superoxides;Humanities;Humanism,NA,NA

PFASs can be released into the atmosphere through both direct and indirect sources, and the gas/particle partition coefficient (KP) is an important parameter that helps us to understand their atmospheric behavior. In this study, we developed a temperature-dependent predictive model for log KP of PFASs and analyzed the molecular mechanism that governs their partitioning equilibrium between gas phase and particle phase. All theoretical computation was carried out at B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level based on neutral molecular structures by Gaussian 09 program package. The regression model has a good statistical performance and robustness. The application domain has also been defined according to OECD guidance. The mechanism analysis shows that electrostatic interaction and dispersion interaction play the most important role in the partitioning equilibrium.

It can be found in the environment and human bodies; however, its potential toxicities are not well studied. Zebrafish have been extensively used as a model for studying toxicants, and currently, two studies have reported on the toxicity of PFHxS in zebrafish from different approaches. Ulhaq and Tse (J Hazard Mater. 2023; 457: 131722) conducted general biological experiments and applied transcriptomics to demonstrate that PFHxS at a concentration of 5 μM could affect glucose and fatty acid metabolism, leading to oxidative stress, developmental defects, and cell cycle arrest. Xu et al. (Sci Total Environ. 2023; 887: 163770) employed metabolomics and showed that concentrations of various metabolites changed after exposure to 3 and 10 μM PFHxS. As we observed a match between the metabolomics data and our biochemistry experimental findings, we integrated the two studies, which enabled us to unfold the possible mechanism of the deregulated metabolites. We identified 22 differential expressed genes (DEGs) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, 17 DEGs in glcyolytic process, including the critical glucokinase under the carbon metabolism. Besides, genes likes aldehyde dehydrogenases, and histone-lysine N-methyltransferases that participate in lipid peroxidation and amino metabolism respectively were spotted. Lastly, we further strengthen our discoveries by undergoing the gene set enrichment analysis.

Fluorinated graphite (FG) particles were used to prepare the DGT binding gel for selective enrichment of trace PFASs in an aqueous environment. The FG-DGT method did not show sensitivity to relevant environmental parameters including pH (5.0–9.0), ionic strength (0.001–0.5 M), or DOM concentration (0–30 mg/L).

They have been found in groundwater, particularly at sites used for training firefighters. They do not biodegrade easily in groundwater, and are not retarded during transport. The most common chemical is Perfluorooctanyl Sulphonate (PFOS), which is mainly used in aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) to extinguish hydrocarbon-fuel fires. It is also used in many herbicide and insecticide formulations, cosmetics, greases and lubricants, paints, polishes, and adhesives. PFOS and related fluoro-organic chemicals have been used since the 1950s. A quantity of fluorosurfactants and related products are still in use all over the world. Intensive studies over the last few years discovered that PFOS and certain by-products were both ubiquitous in the environment and highly persistent. PFOS does not biodegrade in the environment and very limited degradation has been observed in wastewater treatment. The breakthrough curves of a single-well push-pull test indicated that there was no retardation for PFOS as well. It was detected in part-per-billion levels in blood samples obtained from blood banks in the United States, Japan, Europe, and China. There have been more and more reports on the accumulation and effect of PFOS in wild animals' liver, serum and muscle as well.

In this study, six legacy PFASs, six short-chain analogues and five emerging alternatives were investigated in groundwater, surface water and sediment samples taken in the vicinity of a valley-type landfill, which had been in operation for over 20 years. Total PFAS concentrations of 110–236 ng/L, 17.3–163 ng/L and 7.91–164 ng/g dw were detected in the surface water, groundwater and sediment samples, respectively. Overall, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant PFAS in surface water, but elevated concentrations of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) were detected in the surface water samples taken adjacent to the landfill, suggesting that the landfill contributed to these compounds. PFBA was the dominant PFAS in the groundwater and sediments. The concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (C8–C12) in the sediment samples correlated significantly with the TOC, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 contents. The partitioning behaviors of PFCAs in the water-sediment system varied depending on the CF2 moiety units. For the long-chain PFCAs, positive correlations between the average LogKd and the number of CF2 moieties were found to be statistically significant, whereas negative correlations were observed for the short-chain PFCAs (C4–C7). The ratios of short-chain analogues and emerging alternatives versus their respective legacy PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in surface water suggested an increasing trend of short-chain analogues, such as PFBA. The potential health risks of PFOS and PFOA, determined by calculating the estimated daily intake (EDI), were found to be negligible via the drinking groundwater exposure pathway, but more comprehensive studies on the human health risks of PFASs from landfills are essential. © 2020",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141767,Surface waters;PFASs;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;concentration (parameter);unclassified drug;controlled study;persistent organic pollutant;alkyl group;Health risks;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);water sampling;carboxylic acid;drinking water;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;polyfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;health hazard;sediment;Positive correlations;ground water;Groundwater;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids;health risk;landfill;Risk perception;correlational study;environmental impact;Sediments;Land fill;water analysis;Estimated daily intakes;Potential health risks;groundwater;surface water;Elevated concentrations;Landfill;Alumina;Aluminum oxide;Environmental media;Hematite;Short-chain analogues,NA,NA

Accordingly, concern about environmental contamination with perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), such as PFOS, has arisen. However, little information is available on the status and trends in the distribution, sources or risk of PFCs in aquatic environments of China. In the present study, forty two surface water samples collected from five regions with different levels of industrialization were monitored for concentrations of PFCs by use of solid phase extraction and LC/MS/MS. Mean concentrations (maximum concentration) of PFOA and PFOS, which were the dominant PFCs, were 1.2 (2.3) and 0.16 (0.52). ng/l for Guanting, 1.2 (1.8) and 0.32 (1.1). ng/l for Hohhot, 2.7 (15) and 0.93 (5.7). ng/l for Shanxi, 6.8 (12) and 2.6 (11). ng/l for Tianjin, 27 (82) and 4.7 (31). ng/l for Liaoning, respectively. The greatest concentrations of PFCs (121. ng/l), PFOA (82. ng/l) and PFOS (31. ng/l) were observed in Liaoning, which might originate from tributaries of the Liaohe River, the most polluted watershed in Northeast China. While, concentrations of PFCs in the Guanting and Hohhot regions were 3 to 20 fold less than those from Tianjin and Liaoning. This result is consistent with little contribution of PFCs being released from agricultural and non-industrial activities. The magnitudes of mass flow for PFOA and PFOS in decreasing order were: Guanting < Hohhot < Tianjin < Liaoning < Shanxi and Guanting < Hohhot < Shanxi < Tianjin < Liaoning. The larger mass flows of PFOS were accompanied by relatively larger magnitudes of PFOA. Concentrations of both PFOA and PFOS in waters from all regions were less than suggested allowable concentrations. However, the relatively greater concentrations of PFCs in Tianjin and Liaoning suggest that further studies characterizing their sources and potential risk to both humans and wildlife are needed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2011.03.023,Surface waters;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;unclassified drug;comparative study;controlled study;environmental monitoring;perfluoro compound;geographic distribution;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;pollution monitoring;concentration (composition);water pollution;wildlife;liquid chromatography;solid phase extraction;tandem mass spectrometry;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;Perfluorinated compounds;Solid-phase extraction;water sampling;agriculture;article;priority journal;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluoroheptanoic acid;limit of quantitation;limit of detection;perfluorobutanoic acid;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;river;organic pollutant;Environmental contamination;aquatic environment;organic compound;Industry;perfluorodecanesulfonic acid;concentration (parameters);Mean concentrations;pollutant source;Stockholm;water analysis;Elementary particle sources;industrialization;Sources;environmental risk;watershed;PFCs;Liaoning;surface water;Aquatic environments;Northern China;Occurrence;Surface water;Potential risks;human activities;Tianjin;Nei Monggol;Northeast China;Mass flow;Mass transfer;Annual production;Hohhot;Overseas demand;Shanxi,NA,NA

Since 1999–2000, several long-chain PFAS, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), have been detected at trace levels in the blood of most participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)—representative samples of the U.S. general population—while short-chain PFAS have not. Lower detection frequencies and concentration ranges may reflect lower exposure to short-chain PFAS than to PFOS or PFOA or that, in humans, short-chain PFAS efficiently eliminate in urine. We developed on-line solid phase extraction–HPLC–isotope dilution–MS/MS methods for the quantification in 50 μL of urine or serum of 15 C3-C11 PFAS (C3 only in urine), and three fluorinated alternatives used as PFOA or PFOS replacements: GenX (ammonium salt of 2,3,3,3,-tetrafluoro-2-(1,1,2,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoate, also known as HFPO-DA), ADONA (ammonium salt of 4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoate), and 9Cl-PF3ONS (9-chlorohexadecafluoro-3-oxanonane-1-sulfonate), main component of F53-B. Limit of detection for all analytes was 0.1 ng/mL. To validate the method, we analyzed 50 commercial urine/serum paired samples collected in 2016 from U.S. volunteers with no known exposure to the chemicals. In serum, detection frequency and concentration patterns agreed well with those from NHANES. By contrast, except for perfluorobutanoate, we did not detect long-chain or short-chain PFAS in urine. Also, we did not detect fluorinated alternatives in either urine or serum. Together, these results suggest limited exposure to both short-chain PFAS and select fluorinated alternatives in this convenience population. © 2018",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.085,PFAS;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Chromatography;High Pressure Liquid;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;controlled study;chemical substance;chemistry;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Extraction;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;Phase separation;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;high performance liquid chromatography;liquid chromatography;procedures;solid phase extraction;Solid Phase Extraction;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;blood level;mass spectrometry;human;serum;urine;blood;urine level;limit of detection;Long chains;extraction method;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;Surveys;trace element;physical chemistry;Perfluorooctanoate;Shorter chains;urine sampling;formic acid;Salts;Short-chain polyfluoroalkyl substance;On-line solid phase extraction;PFESA;PFESAs;Short-chain PFAS;Urine,NA,NA

Almost all except for root vegetables are sensitive products to temperature. Thus, adopting uninterrupted and appropriate logistics activities with predetermined range of temperature from production site until end-user is critical for ensuring required quality and safety. If a mistake is made during either transport or storage, it not only becomes risky for human health, but also generates huge food waste for the environment and negative economic impact for food providers. Therefore, this study aims to identify all potential factors affecting the cold chain performance in the food industry and to design a framework that includes these factors. This framework is also a roadmap for managers, food providers and logistics parties for sustainable cold chain management. Design/methodology/approach Considering, tangible and intangible potential criteria, the ultimate goal of this study is to identify potential criteria affecting cold food chain performance and propose a conceptual framework including 12 main criteria. Next, the importance order of each criterion and the causal relationships between them are determined. In this study, this relationship among criteria is analyzed by using fuzzy Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMA℡) approach because of its ability to solve complex problems by ensuring causal relationship among factors, additionally to determine importance order. Finally, suggestions for administrative implications are presented. Findings Fuzzy DEMA℡ was used to explain the causal link and importance order among identified drivers. The analysis shows that five criteria (C1, C3, C8, C9 and C12) belong to cause (influential) groups and remaining seven criteria belong to effect (influenced) groups. The highest influential criterion is staff (C8) and is followed by technical issues (C9) as the second most influential factor. Additionally, top three most important factors are traceability (C7), staff (C8) and cold transportation (C5). According to the numerical results of fuzzy DEMA℡ implementations, suggestions for managerial implementations are presented. Practical implications The main contribution of the study is to propose meaningful suggestions for managerial implications about sustainable cold chain in food industry for businesses and to examine causal relations between criteria and to rank criteria in descending importance order. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on determining the potential criteria affecting cold supply chain performance both theoretically and empirically in the sustainability environment.

Stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) were analyzed to elucidate the dietary source. The tawny owl (Strix aluco, n=10) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus, n=40), two terrestrial species, and the osprey (Pandion haliaetus, n=30), a freshwater specie were included. In addition, a temporal trend (1997-2001, 2008-2009, 2013) in osprey was studied as well. The PFAS profile was dominated by perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in eggs from osprey and tawny owl, while for common kestrel per fluorinated carboxylic acids (Sigma PFCA) exceeded the level of PFOS. PFOS concentration in osprey eggs remained at the same level between 1997 and 2001 and 2013. For the long-chained PFCAs, there were a significant increase in concentrations in osprey eggs between 1997 and 2001 and 2008-2009. The levels of PFOS and PFCAs were about 10 and five times higher, respectively, in osprey compared to tawny owl and common kestrel. Evidence of direct exposure from PFCA precursor compounds to birds in both freshwater and terrestrial environment was observed. Low levels of diPAPs were detected in a few samples of osprey (<0.02-2.4 ng/g) and common kestrel (<0.02-0.16 ng/g) eggs, and 6:2 RSA was detected in a majority of the osprey eggs (<6.3-52 ng/g). One saturated telomer acid (7:3 FTCA), which is a transformation marker from precursor exposure, was detected in all species (<0.24-2.7 ng/g). The N-15 data showed higher levels in osprey eggs compared to tawny owl and common kestrel, indicating that they feed on a 2-3 times higher trophic level. We conclude that ospreys are continuously exposed to PFAS at levels where adverse toxic effects have been observed in birds. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the clarification of their ecological and health risks is urgently required. In the present study, the toxicity of a series of PFASs, including PFOS, PFBS, Nafion BP1, Nafion BP2, F53B, OBS, PFOA, PFUnDA, PFO5DoDA, HFPO-TA was investigated. Similarities and differences in the developmental toxicity potentials were revealed. Our results demonstrated that PFUnDA exhibited the highest toxicity with the lowest EC50 value of 4.36 mg/L (for morphological abnormality); this was followed by F53B (5.58 mg/L), PFOS (6.15 mg/L), and OBS (10.65 mg/L). Positive correlations with volatility/solubility and chemotypes related to specific biological activity, including the bioconcentration factor (LogBCF), and negative correlations with lipid solubility and carbon chain component-related chemotypes, including the number of carbon and fluorine atoms, provided a reasonable explanation in the view of molecular structures. Furthermore, comparative transcriptome analysis provided molecular evidence for the relationship between PFASs exposure and malformations. Common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in spine curve development, pericardial edema, and cell/organism growth-related pathways presented common targets, leading to toxic effects. Therefore, the present results provide novel insights into the potential environmental risks of structurally diverse PFASs and contribute to the selection of safer PFAS replacements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166569,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Ecology;Animals;Article;Bioaccumulation;animal;ecosystem;Ecosystem;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;carbon;Carbon;comparative study;controlled study;bioaccumulation;Health risks;lipid;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;gene;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;sulfonic acid derivative;toxicity;Toxicity;embryo development;developmental toxicity;embryo;morphology;human;polyfluoroalkyl substance;metabolism;zebra fish;toxicity testing;chemical structure;Zebrafish;toxic substance;decanoic acid derivative;transcriptomics;Bioactivity;Developmental toxicity;solubility;fluorine;environmental risk;lipid solubility;EC50;cell growth;bone development;5;physical parameters;7;larva;polyfluoroalkyl substances;hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid;sodium 4 perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonic acid;per;differential gene expression;perfluorosulfonic acid;bioconcentration factor;propylene oxide;heart edema;11 pentaoxadodecanoic acid;11-pentaoxadodecanoic acid;9;carbon chain;chemotype;Chemotypes;Development toxicity;Morphological abnormality;nafion BP1;nafion BP2;Nafions;perfluoro 3;perfluoro-3;pericardial disease;pericardial edema;polyfluoroalkyl ether potassium sulfonic acid;spine curve development;Structurally diverse per-;Toxicity potential;Transcriptome analysis,NA,NA

Its persistence in the environment started to appear in many environmental samples and food chains. The removal of these emerging pollutants has been a challenging task for scientists in the last decades. The photocatalytic properties of Cd2+ doped Manganese- Zinc NSFs with chemical formula (Mn0.5Zn0.5)[CdxFe2-x]O-4 (0.0 <= x <= 0.05) NSFs are herein evaluated. The Manganese- Zinc N.S.F.s nanomaterials were deeply characterized, utilizing UV-Vis (reflectance) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption isotherm measurements, and S.E.M., SEM-EDX mapping, and T.E.M. The Kinetic model for the photodegradation of penicillin G (as a model molecule) is investigated using visible light as a source of energy. The kinetic study shows that our results fit well with the modified pseudo-first-order model. The Pen G degradation are 88.73%, 66.65%, 44.70%, 37.62% and 24.68% for x = 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1, respectively, against 14.68% for the free Cd spinel sample. The pseudo-rate constant is bandgap dependent. From the intra-diffusion rate constant (K-d), we developed an intra-diffusion time (tau) model, which decreases exponentially as a function of (x) and mainly shows the existence of three different domains versus cadmium coordination in spinel ferrite samples. Hence, Cadmium's presence generates spontaneous polarization with a strong opportunity to monitor the charge separation and then open the route to a new generation of ""assisted"" photocatalysts under visible light.",NA,10.3390/nano11040970,Kinetics;Penicillin G;Penicillin V;Penicillins,NA,NA

However, PFOS has yielded negative results in various tests of genotoxicity. The present study aimed to investigate the mutagenic response to PFOS in the gpt delta transgenic mouse mutation system and to illustrate the contribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to PFOS genotoxicity. Mutations at the redBA/gam loci were determined by Spi- assay both in vitro and in vivo. DNA damage was measured by phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) and mouse bone marrow micronucleus (MN) testing. Our data showed that PFOS induced concentration-dependent increases in γ-H2AX foci and in mutation frequencies at redBA/gam loci in transgenic mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, which were confirmed by the formation of MNs in the bone marrow and the observations of mutation induction in the livers of gpt delta transgenic mice. Concurrent treatment with catalase, an efficient H2O2 scavenger, significantly decreased the formation of γ-H2AX foci and the mutation yields induced by PFOS. In addition, the generation of H2O2 was found to be closely related to the abnormal peroxisomal β-oxidation caused by PFOS.

However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to these toxic effects are not well known. In the present study, proteomic analysis has been performed to investigate the proteins that are differentially expressed in zebrafish embryos exposed to 0.5 mg/l PFOS until 192 h postfertilization. Two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was employed to detect and identify the protein profiles. The analysis revealed that 69 proteins showed altered expression in the treatment group compared to the control group with either increase or decrease in expression levels (more than twofold difference). Of the 69 spots corresponding to the proteins with altered expression, 38 were selected and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF/TOF) analysis; 18 proteins were identified in this analysis. These proteins can be categorized into diverse functional classes such as detoxification, energy metabolism, lipid transport/steroid metabolic process, cell structure, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Overall, proteomic analysis using zebrafish embryos serves as an in vivo model in environmental risk assessment and provides insight into the molecular events in PFOS-induced developmental toxicity. © The Author 2009.

Two sampling campaigns were performed during the summer of 2009 and in June 2010. Sampling was equally distributed across the 100 French departments. In total, 331 raw-water samples and 110 treated-water samples were analyzed during this study, representing approximately 20% of the national water supply flow. Concentrations of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were determined using automated solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In raw-water samples, the highest individual PFC concentration was 139 ng/L for perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). The sum of all of the determined components was >100 ng/L at three sampling points (199, 117, and 115 ng/L). Of the investigated PFCs, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and PFHxA predominated (detected in 27%, 13%, 11%, and 7% of samples, respectively). Geographical variability was observed, with departments crossed by major rivers or with high population densities being more affected by PFC contamination. Compared with raw water, short-chain PFCAs, but not PFASs, were found in higher abundance in treated water. This difference suggests a relative effectiveness of certain water treatments for the elimination of PFASs but also a possible degradation of PFCA precursors by watertreatment processes. Our investigations did not show any heavily contaminated sites. In treated-water samples, the highest individual PFC concentration was 125 ng/L for PFHxA. The sum of all of the determined components was >100 ng/L at one sampling point (156 ng/L).

Seventeen per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were quantified to evaluate contamination characteristics, apportion source categories and estimate mass inventory and loadings. The concentration of ΣPFASs ranged from 0.26 to 0.82 ng·g−1 at high water-level (HWL) and 0.46–1.53 ng·g−1 at low water-level (LWL).

The distribution of PFASs was more influenced by anthropogenic activities than physicochemical parameters of the sediments. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) identified PFOA-based products was the major sources (40.1% and 38.6%, respectively). Besides, the direct sources of PFOA-, PFOS-, PFNA-and PFBA-based products played the predominant role, while the indirect degradation of precursors contributed relatively little.

A simple and rapid sample pre-treatment was optimised consisting on protein precipitation of 100 μL of sample with acetonitrile (1:1) followed by centrifugation during 10. min. The method was adapted to be sensitive enough and robust with minimum sample injection volume requirements (20 μL). The optimised methodology presented method limits of detection (MLOD) between 0.031 and 0.76 μg/L, detection capabilities (CCα) in the range between 0.005 and 0.99 μg/L and decision limits (CCβ) ranging from 0.006 to 1.16 μg/L. The recoveries in blank blood were calculated by spiking experiments with a mixture of 18 PFASs and established between 70 and 126% for most of compounds. Isotopic dilution was carried out for quantification of selected analytes. In-house validation of this new approach was carried out according to the requirements in the 2002/657/EC Decision. Finally the good applicability of this new approach was proved by the analysis of 60 cord blood samples from two different Mediterranean cities, Barcelona (Spain) and Heraklion (Greece). Ions perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) were found at highest concentration and the more frequently compounds were PFHxS, PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).

The discharge of contaminants associated to these activities pose waterbirds breeding in the Ebro Delta at risk. The aim of this study is to evaluate the exposure of 91 emerging and legacy micropollutants in flamingo chicks (Phoenicopterus roseus), an emblematic species of the area. Fifty chicks of 45–60 days were captured, biometric parameters measured and whole blood collected. Compounds analyzed included perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pharmaceuticals, organophosphate esters (OPEs), in-use pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results indicate a multi-exposure of flamingo's chicks from a very young age. PFASs were the most ubiquitous compounds with ∑PFASs ranging from 9.34 to 576 ng/mL, being PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS detected in all samples. ∑PAHs ranged from 0.19 to 423 ng/mL, ∑PCBs from 0.5 to 15.6 ng/mL and ∑OCs from 1.35 to 37.8 ng/mL. Pharmaceuticals, OPEs and in-use pesticides were not detected. The flamingo's filtering behavior on mud and maternal ovo-transference are the more likely routes of exposure of organic micropollutants to flamingos' chicks. The reported levels of micropollutants were not associated with any alteration in the body condition of chicks.

To better understand the distribution of PFAS in an aquatic system (the Laurentian Great Lakes), stable isotope enrichment (delta C-13 and delta N-15), fatty acid (FA) profiles, and PFAS were measured in various species from the Lake Ontario (LO) aquatic food web. Sampled organisms included top predator fish, prey fish, and benthic and pelagic macroinvertebrates. The trophic level of each species in the LO food web was determined using delta N-15, and FA concentrations (range: <1-139 mg/g wet weight (ww)). The individual PFAS concentrations in the LO food web were similar to 1.5 to 5 times lower than previously reported. The highest PFAS concentrations were observed in deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii, 150 +/- 35. 7 ng/g ww) suggesting a potential source of PFAS from the offshore benthic zone or sediment. The concentration of PFOS and long chain (C9-C14) perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were significantly higher than short chain PFAS indicating the significant impact of hydrophobicity on the bioaccumulation of PFAS in organisms from the food web. However, high molecular weight PFCAs (>C8) did not exhibit increasing biomagnification factors (BMFs) and trophic magnification factors (TMFs) with log k(ow), suggesting hydrophobicity does not govern the movement of PFAS from low to high trophic levels in the LO food web.

However, it is a challenging undertaking because of the trace levels of these contaminants in the environment and biological systems. In this work, fluorinated carbon nanotubes/silk fibroin (F-CNTs/SF) nanofibers were for the first time synthesized by electrospinning and evaluated as a new adsorbent in pipette tip-solid-phase extraction to enrich PFASs. The addition of F-CNTs increased the mechanical strength and toughness of the SF nanofibers, thus improving the durability of composite nanofibers. The proteophilicity of silk fibroin formed the basis of the good affinity of this material with PFASs. The adsorption behaviors of PFASs on the F-CNTs/SF were investigated by adsorption isotherm experiments to understand the mechanism of extraction.

Though levels of some PFAS appear to be decreasing in Canada's south, environmental levels have been increasing in the Arctic due to long-range transport. However, the implications of this on human exposures in sub-Arctic and Arctic populations in Canada have yet to be established. To address this data gap, human biomonitoring research was completed in Old Crow, Yukon, and the Dehcho region, Northwest Territories. Blood samples were collected from adults residing in seven northern First Nations and were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. A total of nine PFAS were quantified: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulphonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulphonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluorobutane sulphonic acid (PFBS). In the Dehcho (n = 124), five PFAS had a detection rate greater than 50% including PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA. In addition to these PFAS, PFUdA was also detected in at least half of the samples collected in Old Crow (n = 54). Generally, male participants had higher concentrations of PFAS compared to female participants, and PFAS concentrations tended to increase with age. For most PFAS, Old Crow and Dehcho levels were similar or lower to those measured in the general Canadian population (as measured through the Canadian Health Measures Survey or CHMS) and other First Nations populations in Canada (as measured through the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative or FNBI). The key exception to this was for PFNA which, relative to the CHMS (0.51 μg/L), was approximately 1.8 times higher in Old Crow (0.94 μg/L) and 2.8 times higher in Dehcho (1.42 μg/L) than observed in the general Canadian population.

The transport and separation of water molecules during water vapor or liquid uptake by sorption or solution and the diffusive transport of water molecules through organic polymer material by permeation or pervaporation may entail an isotopic fractionation. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the extent of such fractionation. METHODS Sixteen bottle-like containers of eleven different organic polymers, including low and high density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and perfluoroalkoxy-Teflon (PFA), of different wall thickness and size were completely filled with the same mineral water and stored for 659?days under the same conditions of temperature and humidity. Particular care was exercised to keep the bottles tightly closed and prevent loss of water vapor through the seals. RESULTS Changes of up to +5 parts per thousand for d2H values and +2.0 parts per thousand for d18O values were measured for water after more than 1?year of storage within a plastic container, with the magnitude of change depending mainly on the type of organic polymer, wall thickness, and container size. The most important variations were measured for the PET and PC bottles. Waters stored in glass bottles with Polyseal (TM) cone-lined PP screw caps and thick-walled HDPE or PFA containers with linerless screw caps having an integrally molded inner sealing ring preserved their original d2H and d18O values. The carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen stable isotope compositions of the organic polymeric materials were also determined. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study clearly show that for precise and accurate measurements of the water stable isotope composition in aqueous solutions, rigorous sampling and storage procedures are needed both for laboratory standards and for unknown samples.

The average recoveries of the different matrices were in general higher than 70% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 21% and method limits of detection (MLOD) ranging from 1.2 to 362. ng/L for the different compounds and matrices. The method was applied to investigate the occurrence of PFCs in 20 samples of human breast milk, and 5 samples of infant formulas and cereal baby food (3 brands of commercial milk infant formulas and 2 brands of cereals baby food). Breast milk samples were collected in 2008 from donors living in Barcelona city (Spain) on the 40. days postpartum. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoro-7-methyloctanoic acid (i,p-PFNA) were predominant being present in the 95% of breast milk samples. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was quantified in 8 of the 20 breast milk samples at concentrations in the range of 21-907. ng/L. Commercial formulas and food were purchased also in 2009 from a retail store. The six PFCs were detected in all brands of milk infant formulas and cereals baby food analyzed, being perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), PFOS, PFOA and i,p-PFNA the compounds detected in higher concentrations (up to 1289. ng/kg). PFCs presence can be associated to possible migration from packaging and containers during production processes. Finally, based on estimated body weight and newborn intake, PFOS and PFOA daily intakes and risk indexes (RI) were estimated for the firsts 6. month of life. We found that ingestion rates of PFOS and PFOA, with exception of one breast milk sample did not exceed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) recommended by the EFSA. However, more research is needed in order to assess possible risk associated to PFCs contamination during early stages of life. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2010.04.016,"Chromatography;Spain;unclassified drug;analytic method;controlled study;digestion;perfluoro compound;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;Phase separation;Catalonia;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);liquid chromatography;solid phase extraction;quantitative analysis;risk assessment;Risk assessment;mass spectrometry;human;milk;article;body weight;priority journal;food intake;organofluorine;Chemical contamination;health risk;Risk perception;sampling;food analysis;Matrix algebra;Perfluorinated chemicals;breast milk;cereal;leaching;Retail stores;food packaging;ion trap mass spectrometry;artificial milk;baby food;Infant formula;Baby food;Baby foods;infant feeding;Barcelona [Catalonia];alkaline digestion;Breast milk;breastfeeding;container;Infant formulas;ingestion rate;LC-QLIT-MS;perfluoro 7 methyloctanoic acid;Infant;Milk Ejection;Milk, Human;Food",NA,NA

HDBPs were found in samples from all locations Studied. Concentrations of total HDBPs (SigmaHDBPs) ranged from 0.4 ng/g lipid weight in ringed seals (Phoca hispida) from the White Sea to 2,540 ng/g lipid weight in Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) from the northwestern North Pacific Ocean. At their highest levels, :SHDBPs made up 11% of the total quantitated organohalogen body burden of adult male Dall's porpoises. In two beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) data subsets, it was found that mates contained Significantly higher concentrations of I HDBPs than females. No significant effects of age or sex on SigmaHDBPs were observed in harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) data subsets. The geographical distribution of concentrations did not resemble that of the ubiquitous anthropogenic organohalogen, polychlorinated biphenyl congener CB-153. Higher concentrations of HDBPs and different patterns of congeners were observed in samples from Pacific as opposed to non-Pacific Ocean influenced environments. Concentrations of HDBPs in beluga from the Arctic and St. Lawrence River were similar. Their high abundance in north Pacific Ocean biota and widespread occurrence suggest that HDBPs undergo extensive transport from a source located primarily in the Pacific Ocean. Evidence from HDBP congener patterns indicates that both ocean currents and atmospheric transport likely play a role in the movement of HDBPs. These results imply that HDBPs and anthropogenic organohalogens have different sources and support the natural production hypothesis.",NA,10.1007/s00244-002-1175-6,Military Personnel,NA,NA

Diet, and in particular fish and seafood, is considered the major intake pathway for humans. The present study investigated the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) contamination in twenty-five samples of fresh fillet of five widely consumed fish species purchased from large retailers in Italy, to be used for an estimation of the Italian population exposure to these contaminants. PFOS and PFOA were found in all samples, at concentrations up to 1,896 (mean = 627 ng/kg) and 487 ng/kg (mean = 75 ng/kg), respectively, confirming the role of fish as high contributor to human exposure. However, a remarkable inter-species variability was observed, and multiple factors were suggested as potentially responsible for such differences, suggesting that the preferential consumption of certain species could likely increase the intake, and thus the exposure. The exposure estimates for both average and high fish consumers resulted far below the TDIs for PFOS and PFOA in all age groups, confirming the outcomes of EFSA’s scientific report. In particular, the calculated total dietary exposure for the 95th percentile consumers belonging to the toddler age class, the most exposed group, resulted equal to 9.72 ng/kg b.w./day for PFOS and 8.39 ng/kg b.w./day for PFOA. © 2016, Page Press Publications.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant PFAS, which increased at a rate of 3.4% per year. Most long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids increased at rates of 3.9 to 7.3% per year except for perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), which did not change significantly over time. The perfluoroalkyl acid precursors perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid were detected, of which the former (FOSA) declined at a rate of -4.4% per year, possibly reflecting its phase-out starting in 2000. An alternate time trend analysis from 2000 to 2013 produced slightly different results, with most compounds increasing at slower rates compared to the entire study period. An exception was perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), increasing at a faster rate of 3.7% measured from 2000 on, compared to the 3.0% per year measured starting from 1981. Analysis of the total fluorine content of the samples revealed large amounts of unidentified fluorine; however, its composition (organic or inorganic) remains unclear. Significant negative correlations were found between concentrations of individual PFASs (with the exception of PFOS) and liver somatic index. In addition, body length was negatively correlated with PFOA and perfluorononanoate, but positively correlated with perfluorododecanoate (PFDoDA) and FOSA.

Furthermore, partitioning of PFCs between water and particles (oysters' food) was examined at different salinities. The distribution coefficients (K-d; partitioning between water and particles) for selected PFCs, that is, PFOS, PFOA, PFDA, and PFUnDA, increased by 2.1- to 2.7-fold with the increase in water salinity from 10 to 34 psu, suggesting ""salting-out"" effect, and the salting constant (delta) was estimated to range from 0.80 to 1.11. The nonlinear regression analysis of bioaccumulation suggested increase in aqueous and dietary uptake rates (K-w and K-f) with the increase in salinity, which resulted in elevated bioaccumulation, although the depuration rates (K-e) also increased. The relative abundance of long carbon chain length PFCs (i.e., PFDA and PFUnDA) increased as salinity increased, while the proportion of PFOS and PFOA decreased, which is explained by the positive relationship between delta and carbon chain length.

In this study, the impacts of bioturbation of three benthic organisms, i.e. Chironomus kiiensis, Hyalella azteca and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, on the release of PFOS from sediment were investigated, and the toxic effects of PFOS to C. kiiensis were explored in the presence of one or two of the other benthic organisms. Among the three organisms, C. kiiensis displayed the weakest effect on the distribution of PFOS between sediment and water (P ＞ 0.05). The bioturbation of H. azteca and L. hoffmeisteri distinctly facilitated the suspension of sediment, leading to the enhanced amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the flux of PFOS from sediment to SPM.

This study focused on the occurrences of PFCs and PFCs mass flows in the industrial wastewater treatment plants, which reported to be the important sources of PFCs. Surveys were conducted in central wastewater treatment plant in two industrial zones in Thailand. Samples were collected from influent, aeration tank, secondary clarifier effluent, effluent and sludge. The major purpose of this field study was to identify PFCs occurrences and mass flow during industrial WWTP. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with HPLC-ESI-MS/MS were used for the analysis. Total 10 PFCs including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoropropanoic acid (PFPA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluoronanoic acid (PFNA), perfluordecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) were measured to identify their occurrences. PFCs were detected in both liquid and solid phase in most samples. The exceptionally high level of PFCs was detected in the treatment plant of IZ1 and IZ2 ranging between 662-847ngL-1 and 674-1383ngL-1, respectively, which greater than PFCs found in most domestic wastewater. Due to PFCs non-biodegradable property, both WWTPs were found ineffective in removing PFCs using activated sludge processes. Bio-accumulation in sludge could be the major removal mechanism of PFCs in the process. The increasing amount of PFCs after activated sludge processes were identified which could be due to the degradation of PFCs precursors. PFCs concentration found in the effluent were very high comparing to those in river water of the area. Industrial activity could be the one of major sources of PFCs contamination in the water environment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.02.059,effluent;wastewater;PFOS;Thailand;unclassified drug;bioaccumulation;perfluoro compound;Phase separation;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;high performance liquid chromatography;solid phase extraction;tandem mass spectrometry;perfluorohexanoic acid;Perfluorinated compounds;river water;article;perfluoroheptanoic acid;electrospray mass spectrometry;organofluorine;PFOA;Industrial water treatment;sludge;Wastewater treatment;Industry;waste water treatment plant;water treatment;Effluents;industrial area;perfluorohexane sulfonate;aeration;Perfluorinated compound (PFCs);activated sludge;Wastewater;industrial location;Sewage pumping plants;Water treatment plants;Reclamation;Municipal wastewater treatment plants;perfluoropropanoic acid;mass transport;Industrial plants;Industrial wastewater treatment plants;domestic waste;Activated sludge process;Central wastewater treatment plants;field survey;Mass flow;Mass transfer;perfluordecanoic acid;perfluoronanoic acid,NA,NA

Whether the pre-existing analytical methods for historically monitored PFASs, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), could be transferable to a large breadth of newly identified PFASs remains, however, an open question. Data from various lines of evidence indicate that current extraction procedures previously validated with anionic and neutral PFASs may seriously underperform for many cationic and zwitterionic PFASs. The extraction efficiency and instrumental response could be strongly matrix-dependent, which may preclude a robust analysis. The present study sought to investigate a suitable sample preparation procedure for the analysis of anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic PFASs in soil samples. In total, 86 PFASs, representing 24 chemical classes previously discovered in AFFF formulations or at AFFF-impacted sites, were evaluated. The merits and limitations of various extraction media were examined using an AFFF-impacted field-weathered loam soil, as well as a background loam soil amended with AFFFs in-house. Methanol with hydrochloric acid provided excellent recoveries for most cationic and zwitterionic PFASs, including fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaines (e.g., 6:2 FTAB) and fluorotelomer betaines (e.g., 9:1:2 FTB), yet performed less satisfactorily for certain anionic PFASs, and may also cause conversion of some PFASs. Sequential extractions using methanol with ammonium acetate exhibited limited matrix effects and suitable recoveries of PFASs from soils of diverse textural classes and organic matter content. The newly-developed extraction method presented the best option for future in-depth characterization of PFASs at AFFF-impacted sites. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aca.2018.06.046,Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;unclassified drug;controlled study;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Extraction;perfluoroalkyl substance;Chemical analysis;organic matter;soil;aqueous film forming foam;Aqueous film forming foams;foam;organofluorine derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;Soils;Recovery;Noise abatement;process optimization;extraction;methanol;environmental impact;Methanol;Matrix effects;Betaines;soil amendment;ammonium acetate;fluorotelomer betaine;Extraction efficiencies;loam soil;Sample preparation procedure;Aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs);Fluorosurfactants;Fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaine (FTAB);fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkylbetaine;hydrochloric acid;Matrix effect assessment;Method optimization;Novel fluorosurfactants;process design;product recovery;Recovery from soils;soil texture,NA,NA

However, the mechanism of HOC biomagnification is not fully understood. To fill this gap, this study investigated the effect of predation on the bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), one type. of HOC, in low-to-high aquatic trophic levels under constant freely dissolved PAR concentrations (1, 5, or 10 mu g L-1) maintained by passive dosing systems. The tested PAHs included phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene. The test organisms included zebrafish, which prey on Daphnia magna, and cichlids, which prey on zebrafish. The results revealed that for both zebrafish and cichlids, predation elevated the uptake and elimination rates of PAHs. The increase of uptake rate constant ranged from 20.8% to 39.4% in zebrafish with the amount of predation of 5 daphnids per fish per day, and the PAR uptake rate constant increased with the amount of predation. However, predation did not change the final bioaccumulation equilibrium; the equilibrium concentrations of PAHs in fish only depended on the freely dissolved concentration in water. Furthermore, the lipid-normalized water-based bioaccumulation factor of each PAR was constant for fish at different trophic levels. These findings infer that the final bioaccumulation equilibrium of PAHs is related to a partition between water and lipids in aquatic organisms, and predation between trophic levels does not change bioaccumulation equilibrium but bioaccumulation kinetics at stable freely dissolved PAR concentrations. This study suggests that if HOCs have not reached bioaccumulation equilibrium, biomagnification occurs due to enhanced uptake rates caused by predation in addition to higher lipid contents in higher trophic organisms. Otherwise, it is only due to the higher lipid contents in higher trophic organisms.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.5b00071,Hydrophilic Interactions;Hydrophobic;Prednisolone;Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions,NA,NA

At least whole program blanks, procedural blanks and instrument blanks are needed to monitor blank pollution in different stage. High grade of reagents, low background contamination, affective extraction methods and high resolution mass spectrometry could improve the method sensitivity. The most frequently used technique of solid phase extraction (SPE) -liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) could determine volatile, semi-volatile and nonvolatile PFASs. The volatile PFASs such as fluorotelomeric alcohols should not be under nitrogen-blow after SPE process. There is an omit of concentrations of unknow PFASs in the target analysis on LC-MS/MS due to lack of certified standards.

Here, we investigate how the differential tissue distribution and bioaccumulation behavior of 25 PFASs in crucian carp from two field sites impacted by point sources can provide information about the processes governing uptake, distribution and elimination of PFASs. Median tissue/blood ratios (TBRs) were consistently <1 for all PFASs and tissues except bile which displayed a distinct distribution pattern and enrichment of several perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids. Transformation of concentration data into relative body burdens (RBBs) demonstrated that blood, gonads, and muscle together accounted for >90% of the amount of PFASs in the organism. Principal component analyses of TBRs and RBBs showed that the functional group was a relatively more important predictor of internal distribution than chain-length for PFASs. Whole body bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for short-chain PFASs deviated from the positive relationship with hydrophobicity observed for longer-chain homologues.

Herein, we used embryonic stem cell test procedure as a tool to assess the developmental cardiotoxicity of PFOS. The differentially expressed proteins were identified by quantitative proteomics that combines the stable isotope labeling of amino acids with high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Results of the embryonic stem cell test procedure suggested that PFOS was a weak embryotoxic chemical. Nevertheless, a few marker proteins related to cardiovascular development (Brachyury, GATA4, MEF2C, -actinin) were significantly reduced by exposure to PFOS. In total, 176 differential proteins were identified by proteomics analysis, of which 67 were upregulated and 109 were downregulated. Gene ontology annotation classified these proteins into 13 groups by molecular functions, 12 groups by cellular locations and 10 groups by biological processes. Most proteins were mainly relevant to either catalytic activity (25.6%), nucleus localization (28.9%) or to cellular component organization (19.8%). Pathway analysis revealed that 32 signaling pathways were affected, particularly these involved in metabolism. Changes in five proteins, including L-threonine dehydrogenase, X-ray repair cross-complementing 5, superoxide dismutase 2, and DNA methyltransferase 3b and 3a were confirmed by Western blotting, suggesting the reliability of the technique. These results revealed potential new targets of PFOS on the developmental cardiovascular system. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",NA,10.1002/jat.3207,Sulfones,NA,NA

Livers from four pups and ten adult harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) stranded in San Francisco Bay (SFB) and the Gulf of Maine (GOM) were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs). We used GC-ECD and GC-NCI/MS to investigate the presence of 28 PCBs and 8 OH-PCB metabolites, respectively. Sigma(28)PCB concentrations (di- to octa-CBs) ranged from 1.81 to 35.9 mu g/g lipid with a median of 6.53 for the seal pups and 2.31 to 249 mu g/g lipid with a median of 28.9 for the adult seals. Sigma(8)OH-PCB concentrations (penta- to hepta-OH-PCBs) ranged from 0.02 to 0.69 mu g/g lipid with a median of 0.04 for the adult seals, i.e., at much lower concentrations than those for PCBs. Ratios of OH-PCBs to PCBs (0.24% on average) were comparable to those in beluga whale, but were lower than ratios in human livers. The OH-PCB profiles were slightly different between SFB and GOM seal livers, although similar PCB congener patterns were observed. Generally, 4-OH-CB107 was found predominantly in seal livers and was the only OH-PCB detectable in most of seal pup livers. This study provides information on OH-PCBs in seals. adding to the scarce exposure data for these chemicals.

A global treaty to regulate the manufacture and release of some of the most persistent trace chemicals has been promulgated and signed. The marine environment is an important sink for many trace chemicals, some of which accumulate in the marine food chain and in particular in marine mammals. With respect to the global distribution of trace organic chemicals, the levels of organohalogen compounds in the Southern Hemisphere are comparatively lower for a given environmental compartment and latitude compared to the Northern Hemisphere. A debate is currently evolving about the toxicity of alternative halogen substitutions such as bromine instead of chlorine and also of mixed halogen substitution. Recently a series of potentially natural bioaccumulative and persistent organohalogen chemicals have been found in marine mammals and turtles at levels in excess of those of anthropogenic trace organochlorines including PCBs and DDE. Little is known about the sources, behaviour and effects of natural trace organic chemicals.

However, related risk assessments in remote regions are lacking. In this study we investigated three kinds of POPs in four common fish species (n = 62) from high-altitude rivers and lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that the lipid weight concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and perfluoroalkyl sub-stances (PFAS) in fish muscle followed the order & sigma;13PAHs (24.5-3354 ng/g) > & sigma;11PFAS (2.48-164 ng/g) > & sigma;7OCPs (1.61-82.2 ng/g), which is comparable to that found in other remote regions. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was optimized using physiological parameters specific to the sampled Tibetan fish to generate accurate ef-fective concentration (EC) thresholds. Based on these measured concentrations and newly simulated EC thresholds, the ecological risk ratios for selected toxic POPs (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), pyrene (Pyr), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)) ranged from 8.53 x 10-8 to 2.03 x 10-5. Racoma tibetanus and Schizothorax macropogon were the most vulnerable Tibetan fish species. All the risk ratios were far below 1, indicating that there was no risk of POPs to-wards Tibetan fish. However, the risk ratios for emerging POPs (i.e., PFOS) were 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than for legacy POPs (i.e., DDT and Pyr), suggesting that monitoring of emerging POPs should be reinforced.

Conclusions from a Case Study on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances,2016,NA,NA,INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT,"[""1551-3777"", ""1551-3793""]",12,1,6-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"This review examines the usefulness of the metrics BMF (biomagnification factor) and TMF (trophic magnification factor), derived from field measurements of the levels of contaminants in naturally occurring biota, for characterizing the bioaccumulation potential (""B"") of chemicals. Trophic magnification factor and BMF values greater than 1.0 are often considered to be the most conclusive indicators of B status, and the TMF criterion has been referred to as the ""gold standard"" for B categorization. Although not wishing to dispute the theoretical primacy of field-derived BMFs and TMFs as B metrics, we make the case that, in practice, the study-to-study (and even within-study) variability of the results is so great that they are of very restricted usefulness for assessing B status, at least in the case of the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), on which we focus here. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the results of 24 peer-reviewed studies reporting field-derived BMFs or TMFs for 14 PFASs, for which BMF values often range over several orders of magnitude from << 1.0 to >> 1.0, sometimes even in the same study. For TMFs, the range is a factor of approximately 20 for the most intensely studied PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA] and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS]). We analyze the possible causes for such variability: To some extent it results from the differing ways in which the metrics are expressed, but most of the scatter is likely attributable to such factors as nonachievement of the tacitly assumed steady-state conditions, uncertainties in the feeding ecology, the impact of metabolism of precursor compounds, and so forth. As more trustworthy alternatives to field-derived BMFs and TMFs, we suggest the implementation of dietary BMF studies performed under strictly controlled conditions on aquatic, terrestrial, and avian species, as well as the consideration of measured elimination half-lives, which have been demonstrated to be directly related to BMF values.

PFOS concentrations measured in all lakes, except in Lake Maggiore, are homogeneous with an average of 3.1 ± 1.9 ng g −1 ww, which could be considered the “anthropogenic background concentration” of PFOS in fish of lakes located in an industrialised and urbanised region but without point sources. In Lake Maggiore, fish concentrations always exceed the EU EQS biota (9.1 ng g −1 ww) based on human fish consumption. Considering the effective consumption of fish in this area, an actual risk for fish consumption by humans is not evidenced, while a moderate risk of secondary poisoning for predators is highlighted. PFOA has been detected in significant concentration only in one sample in Lake Maggiore, while long chain PFCAs have been detected without significant differences among the lakes (0.3 to 2.7 ng g −1 ww).

Therefore, we compared potential differences in egg PFAA profile and concentrations between two widely studied passerine species, great tit (Parus major) and blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), which are similar in many aspects of their ecology and life history. Whole clutches of both species were collected from the same breeding season and at the same place (Antwerp, Belgium), enabling us to study laying order effects. Additionally, we evaluated how egg PFAA concentrations for both species changed along a distance gradient from a PFAA point source. Although the sum PFAA concentrations did not significantly differ between great tits and blue tits, large differences in PFAA profile and laying order effects were observed. Great tits showed a more diverse PFAA detection profile, including perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and various long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) but no short-chain compounds. Contrarily, short-chain PFCAs (perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA)) were only detected in blue tit eggs. The variation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) concentrations within clutches was large in both species, although laying order effects on PFOA concentrations were only found in blue tits. Although egg PFOA concentrations of both species decreased similarly from the fluorochemical point source onwards, more variation in egg PFOA concentrations could be explained by distance from the fluorochemical plant in great tits (60%) than in blue tits (15%). Results showed that both species markedly differed in terms of egg PFAA profile and concentrations, most likely reflecting differences in diet, foraging habits and egg protein composition.

Objectives: To analyze the kinetics and characteristics of this release during drastic weight loss after bariatric surgery and compare the results in case of women of childbearing age (WCBA) with critical blood concentration thresholds. Methods: 100 morbidly obese patients (73 women including 53 of childbearing age and 27 men) were screened before and 3, 6 and 12 months after bariatric surgery for serum concentrations of 67 congeners or metabolites of banned or not yet banned organohalogenated persistent pollutants, including highly lipophilic polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and less lipophilic perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs). Results: Circulating levels of all chemicals, except PFASs, increased progressively after surgery, reaching after one year an increase between 30 and 139% compared to initial pre-surgical levels; median levels increased for PCB153 from 36.8 to 86.4 ng/g lw (+130%), for dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p’-DDE) from 59.8 to 136.1 ng/g lw (+120%), and for hexachlorobenzene (HCB) from 9.8 to 20.3 ng/g lw (+110%). Weight loss averaging 30% of initial body weight at 12 months in both sexes (mean: 40.0 kg for men, 36.1 kg for women), was the main parameter related to the concentration increases (3.1 to 3.6% per kilogram weight loss). They were not dependent on initial BMI, presence of metabolic syndrome or type of surgical procedure but influenced by gender and biochemical properties such as degree of chlorination for PCBs and/or lipophilicity since PFASs did not increase at all. ∑PCB6 in blood after one year exceeded the critical concentration threshold for 24.5% women of childbearing age (13/53) versus 3.6% (2/53) before surgery. Discussion: Massive weight loss within the first year following bariatric surgery is associated with a sustained increase of circulating lipophilic POPs. Short- and long-term consequences should be considered, mostly for childbearing age obese women, because of potential health risks for the future fetus and breastfeeding infant. © 2021 The Author(s)",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106400,Female;Humans;Persistent organic pollutants;Article;Pesticides;Hydrocarbons;Obesity;Weight Loss;Blood;body mass;female;male;Male;controlled study;Organic pollutants;polybrominated diphenyl ether;polychlorinated biphenyl;Environmental Pollutants;persistent organic pollutant;Persistent Organic Pollutants;pollutant;Health risks;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;chlorinated hydrocarbon;concentration (composition);Flame retardants;pollution exposure;adult;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;human;pesticide;Adult;aged;major clinical study;lipophilicity;endocrine disruptor;obesity;polybrominated biphenyl;limit of quantitation;limit of detection;Metabolites;polychlorinated biphenyl derivative;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);Endocrine disruptors;Organochlorine pesticides;Potential health risks;Brominated flame retardants (BFRs);womens health;abdominal obesity;waist circumference;insulin resistance;morbidity;homeostasis model assessment;Chlorinated;bariatric surgery;Bariatric Surgery;analysis of variance;age structure;Bariatric surgery;Biochemical properties;blood pressure regulation;body weight loss;childbearing;clinical examination;Critical concentration;Critical exposure values;HOMA index;laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy;Morbid;morbid obesity;Morbid obesity;Transplantation (surgical);Women of child-bearing ages;Women of childbearing age;women's health,NA,NA

MR was not associated with mercury. Additionally, levels of TT3 were negatively related to Sigma CHLs but not to PFTrA. The findings from the present study indicate that some OCs (in both sexes) and some PFASs (only in females) could disrupt fine adjustment of BMR during reproduction in adult kittiwakes. Importantly, highly lipophilic OCs and highly proteinophilic PFASs appear, at least in females, to have the ability to disrupt the metabolic rate in an opposite way.

We found significant inverse associations between Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and birth weight (adjusted beta = - 119 g, 95% CI: -201; -36), birth length (adjusted beta = -037 cm, 95% CI: -0.76; 0.02, borderline significant) and head circumference (adjusted beta = -0.35 cm, 95% CI: -059; -0.10) and a positive association with GA (adjusted<b> beta = 0.45 week, 95% CI: 0.17; 0.74). For the lipophilic POPs, we found an overall trend of inverse associations to foetal growth indices. In conclusion, we found that the amphiphilic PFOA had a significant inversely association with foetal growth indices, whereas GA was positively associated. The data indicate that POPs have a negative effect on foetal growth. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134118,character(0),NA,NA

Within this class the best studied substances are the perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs). PFSAs and PFCAs have been detected in human serum samples from all around the world and are ubiquitous in the global environment and wildlife. As well as being completely resistant to environmental degradation, some PFSAs and PFCAs are bioaccumulative and potentially toxic, which raises a concern about population-wide exposure to this group of substances. Dietary intake has been suggested as a major pathway of human exposure to the two most widely studied substances among PFSAs and PFCAs, namely perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). However, the difficulties associated with the analysis of PFSAs, PFCAs and related PFASs at ultra-trace levels in food samples have hampered the understanding of human exposure. Recent advances in analytical chemistry have dramatically improved the ability to measure these substances and other PFASs in food matrices, and method detection limits down to low picogram per gram food can now be reached. Worldwide interlaboratory studies also indicate that the accuracy and precision of analytical methods have significantly improved over the last decade. These modern methods have been applied to quantify human dietary exposure to PFCAs and PFSAs in several European countries. Overall, the exposure to PFOS and PFOA from diet is typically a factor of 6 to 10 higher than the exposure from other known exposure pathways for the general adult population of Western countries. Furthermore, application of toxicokinetic models indicates that present day serum concentrations of PFOS and PFOA can largely be explained by the estimated dietary exposures. Despite the recent advances in analytical techniques, the sources of food contamination are not very well characterized. It has been demonstrated that bioaccumulation and biomagnification in aquatic food webs is a primary transfer mechanism for PFOS and several long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids to the human diet. However, more research is needed to understand the accumulation of PFASs in terrestrial food webs and the transfer of a range of PFASs from food-contact materials. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.",NA,10.1533/9780857098917.2.279,"PFOS;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Food;Diet;PFOA;Human exposure;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly I-C;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases",NA,NA

Following the global actions to limit perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and its salts, chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), as an alternative perfluorochemical, has been a focus during this period. In this study, PFASs in coastal seawater, sediment, and seaweed from the significant aquaculture bases of Porphyra haitanensis in the southeast of China were investigated. Their bioaccumulation and ecological risk were elucidated and associated human exposures to PFASs with consumption of aquatic products for rural and urban groups were calculated. The total PFASs levels in seawater and sediment were 21.52-241.86 ng/L and 4.55-26.54 ng/g & middot;dw, respectively. F-53B was found frequently and has relative high concentration in seawater (ND-2.13 ng/L). The Porphyra haitanensis and Siganus fuscescens were also analyzed, with PFASs concentrations ranging from 10.45 to 29.98 ng/g & middot;dw and 7.17 to 25.43 ng/g & middot;dw, respectively. The total logarithm BAF of F-53B and PFOS in two kinds of detected seafoods were within 0-2.94 and 2.01-3.25, these values did not vary in different sites. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of PFASs through aquatic products consumption in rural and urban residents were 0.03-26.50 ng/kg bw/day and 0.17-37.01 ng/kg bw/day, respectively, based on the Dietary Guidelines for Chinese residents. The total EDI of PFASs via Porphyra haitanensis and Siganus fuscescens in different groups were significantly lower than the suggested tolerable daily intake (PFOS, 150 ng/kg bw/day; PFOA, 1500 ng/kg bw/day), which indicates that PFASs did not induce health risks to the residents living around these aquaculture bases.

Presently, there are wide ranges of PFCs, and owing to their bioaccumulative properties, they have been detected in various environmental matrices and in human sera. It has thus been suggested that they are hazardous. Hence, this review aims at highlighting the recent development in PFC research, with a particular focus on perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the most studied and predominantly found PFCs in various environmental matrices, although recent reports have included perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), which was previously regarded as innocuously harmless, when compared to its counterparts, PFOA and PFOS. As such, proper investigations are thus required for a better understanding of short-chain PFC substitutes, which have been suggested as suitable replacements to long-chained PFCs, although these substitutes have also been suggested to pose various health risks comparable to those associated with long-chain PFCs. Similarly, several novel technologies, such as PFC reduction using zero-valent iron, including removal at point of use, adsorption and coagulation, have been proposed. However, regardless of how efficient removers some of these techniques have proven to be, short-chain PFCs remain a challenge to overcome for scientists, in this regard. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",NA,10.1007/s10661-017-6084-2,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Adsorption;Environmental Health;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;Health risks;chemical compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;surfactant;procedures;biota;adsorption;ecosystem restoration;human;occupational exposure;carboxylic acid;organofluorine derivative;research;environmental health;prenatal exposure;health hazard;perfluorobutane sulfonate;analysis;Caprylates;chemical structure;octanoic acid derivative;PFOA;health risk;fluorotelomer alcohol;environment;health impact;environmental impact;Atoms;perflubutane;pollution transport;fluorine;Environment;Chains;perfluorocarboxylate;perfluorosulfonate;Polyfluoroalkyl compounds;iron;Fluorine;Remediation;polyfluoroalkyl derivative;coagulation;chemical procedures;Environmental Restoration;PFBS;biotechnology;fluorotelomer carboxylate;polyfluorinated sulfonamide;Substitutes;Humanities;Humanism,NA,NA

While water temperature controls many physiological processes in fish, knowledge of the effects of this factor on PFAS toxicokinetic is still limited. This study presents experimental results of internal distribution and elimination rates of two perfluorinated acid compounds, namely perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) in adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to three temperatures. Dietary exposure experiments were conducted at 7 °C, 11 °C, and 19 °C and liver, blood, muscle, brain, and kidney were sampled for analysis. PFOS concentrations were comparable to or exceeded those of PFHxS, while PFHxS was eliminated faster than PFOS, whatever the temperature. Internal distribution changed significantly for both substances when fish were exposed to a range of temperatures from 7 to 19 °C. Indeed, PFOS and PFHxS relative distribution increased in blood, liver, and brain while they decreased in muscle when the water temperature rose.

Initial measurements with standard EA-IRMS equipment, which used high-temperature pyrolysis to convert the organic compounds into hydrogen, did not achieve significant signals for polychlorinated pesticides and related compounds, presumably due to the formation of HCl instead of hydrogen. To reverse this problematic reaction, a chromium reactor was incorporated into the element analyzer system, which scavenged Cl, forming chromium chloride and releasing hydrogen again in the form of H-2. The optimized system therefore allowed the delta H-2 values of polyhalogenated compounds to be determined. A quality assurance program was developed based on several parameters. (i) Each compound was analyzed using a sequence of five injections, where the first measurement was discarded. (ii) Recovery of H (when calculated relative to acetanilide) had to be > 90% for all replicates in a sequence. (iii) All delta-values within a sequence had to vary by less than 10 parts per thousand. (iv) Results had to be reproducible on another day with a different sample scheme. Once this reproducibility had been established, variabilities in the delta H-2 values of organohalogen standards were investigated using the technique. The highest delta H-2 value of +75 parts per thousand was found for o,p'-DDD, whereas the strongest depletion in deuterium was found for Melipax (-181 parts per thousand). The most important results for comparable compounds were as follows. DDT-related compounds gave delta H-2 values of between +59 and +75 parts per thousand (technical DDT, o,p'- and p,p'-DDD) or in the range of approximately -1 parts per thousand, indicative of the different sources/methods of producing this compound. Four HCH isomers from the same supplier showed relatively similar hydrogen isotope distributions, whereas two lindane (gamma-HCH) standards from other sources had 39 parts per thousand less deuterium. This difference is likely due to different purification steps during the isolation of pure lindane from the technical HCH mixture. An even greater difference was observed between the delta H-2 values of Toxaphene (US product dating from 1978) and Melipax (product from the former East Germany, dating from 1979), which gave delta H-2 values of -101 parts per thousand and -181 parts per thousand, respectively, meaning that both products were easily distinguished via delta H-2-IRMS. Fractioning of hydrogen isotopes in the atmospheric water cycle was suggested as one reason for the different values. In this theory, the water (which had different delta H-2 values depending on where it was taken from) was incorporated during the biosynthesis of camphene, which is the natural product used to produce both products. These results indicate that hydrogen isotope-specific analysis can be a valuable tool for tracing the origins of a compound in certain cases.",NA,10.1007/s00216-005-0160-0,Mass Spectrometry;Chromium;Oxalic Acid,NA,NA

Perfluoroalkyl sulfonated compounds are excellent mist suppressants, thanks to their chemical stability and surface activity. Therefore, despite mounting evidence for their persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity, it is likely that such chemicals will continue to be used for the foreseeable future because of their importance and lack of alternatives. The present study is aimed at assessing the feasibility of advanced reduction as an effective technology to treat chrome plating industry wastewater. In particular, wastewater containing a chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (i.e. F–53B), an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) used to prepare chrome mist suppressant in China, was treated by UV-activated sulfite. Results demonstrates that in ultrapure water F–53B can be easily degraded within 1 min—much faster than PFOS. Stoichiometric fluoride recovery was also achieved, confirming significant defluorination of the pollutant. Such superior reducibility was due to the presence of chlorine atoms, as corroborated by quantum chemical calculations. F–53B degradation was also achieved in chrome plating industrial wastewater, which yielded results were slower than those achieved in the laboratory nonetheless obtained complete abatement within 60 min.

This approach is based on caged gammarids and trophic magnification factors (TMFs) at the first tier, with fish analyzed at the second tier at sites predicted to exceed the EQS at the first tier. A dataset was implemented by monitoring perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in caged gammarids exposed at 15 sites in French rivers, and in fish muscle and rest-of-body from the same sites. Isotopic ratios (delta C-13 and delta(15) N) were also measured in gammarids and fish. Two scenarios were developed to compare measured PFOS concentrations in fish against predicted concentrations based on measures in caged gammarids and TMFs. Scenario (1) compared measured PFOS concentrations in fish fillets with predicted PFOS concentrations based on measured concentrations in caged gammarids and delta(15) N. Scenario (2) tested whether or not EQS exceedance was correctly predicted based on measured concentrations in caged gammarids and trophic levels (TLs) from wild fish and gammarid populations. Results delta C-13 and delta(15) N variations showed that caged gammarids used local food resources during exposure in the field. PFOS concentrations in gammarids were fairly variable through time at each site. In fish, concentrations ranged from < 1 to 250 ng g(-1)(wet weight). After adjustment to the TL at which the EQS is set, 12 sites were above the EQS for PFOS. In scenario (1), predicted concentrations were almost correct at 7 sites out of 15. Most incorrect predictions were overestimations that were slightly improved by applying a lower (neutral) TMF. In scenario (2) we tested several variants for parameters involved in the predictions. The most efficient combination yielded two wrong predictions out of 15. This result was obtained with a higher (more conservative) TMF value, mean concentrations in gammarids from several field exposures during a year, and a TL for gammarids at the median of the distribution in French rivers. Conclusion The proposed tiered approach was thus efficient. However, the number of sites was relatively limited, and the dataset was biased towards EQS exceedance. The tiered approach warrants further validation.",NA,10.1186/s12302-020-00416-4,character(0),NA,NA

Hence, contaminant levels in their eggs provide insights into sources and relative importance of aquatic versus terrestrial pathways of chemical transfer. Here, perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) known to be bioaccumulative were measured in individual herring gull eggs from one site on Lake Superior, Ontario, Canada. Thirteen per -fluorinated carboxylates (PFCA, C4-C18) and four perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSA, C4-C10) were measured. Total PFCA and total PFSA concentrations varied 4-and 5-fold, respectively, among eggs. To understand these differences, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes and fatty acid dietary tracers were measured in the same eggs. Stable isotopes were not useful in explaining inter-egg differences in PFAA concentrations. However, a variety of omega 3 (n-3) and omega 6 (n-6) fatty acid measures were correlated with C9 -C13 PFCAs as well as the PFSAs: perfluoro-1-hexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluoro-1-octanesulfonic acid (PFOS). In general, n-3 fatty acids were positively correlated with egg PFAA concen-trations while only the n-6 fatty acids exhibited negative relationships with egg PFAA levels. Proportions of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in eggs would be expected to increase and decrease, respectively, with increased aquatic food in the gull diet. Results indicate that increased use of aquatic food led to height-ened PFAA exposure in these generalist consumers sampled in a relatively remote area. They also high-light the utility of employing a variety of dietary markers for understanding contaminant exposure and accumulation.

Na-Mica-4 and C18-Mica− 4 were prepared and characterized by X-Ray diffraction, Zeta potential, specific surface area, thermogravimetric analysis and transmission electron microscopy, before and after adsorption experiments. The influence of the aqueous sample pH, salt addition and extraction time in the removal were evaluated. The results showed the high adsorption affinity of C18-Mica-4 for most of the emerging pollutants analysed after a removal time of 24 h (14 out of 18 pollutants were effectively removed [70–100%]). A high correlation was observed between the log Kow of the selected emerging pollutants and the adsorption onto C18-Mica-4. The results also indicate that adsorption occurs in the interlayer space. While the removal rates with Na-Mica-4 were in the range 8–97% after seven days, some of the compounds, perfluorobutanoic acid and most of pharmaceutically active compounds, were not adsorbed onto the high-charge mica.

After 96 h of exposure to several concentrations of BPA, the growth of C. reinhardtii was affected, being the 96 h-EC50 value for growth 30 mg L-1. The toxicity and bioaccumulation of 30 mg L-1 BPA in microalgae after 24 h of exposure were studied. Several cytotoxicity biomarkers such as vitality, oxidative stress and cytoplasmic membrane potential were altered in exposed cells and microalgae accumulated 0.16 pg BPA cell(-1). Regarding C. fluminea, four treatments were established: control without BPA (C); BPA in the food (microalgae pre-exposed for 24 h to 30 mg L-1) (M); BPA in the water (7.5 mg L-1) (W); BPA in both food and water (M + W). After one month of exposure, treated bivalves showed a significantly decrease in the filtration rate and increased lipid peroxidation levels, indicating fitness reduction and oxidative damage. Furthermore, the activities of catalase, glutathione reductase, Se-dependent and total glutathione peroxidase enzymes increased significantly in W and M + W treatments with respect to the control. Clams of the M + W treatment were the most affected, indicating that the little amount of BPA bioaccumulated by microalgae could increase the damage.

Our findings show that the TTR-binding activity related to contaminant levels was significantly lower (45%) in 2008 than in 1998 (mean ± standard error of mean: 1998, 2265 ± 231 nM; 2008, 1258 ± 170 nM). Although we cannot exclude a potential influence of between-year differences in capture location and cub body mass, our findings most likely reflect reductions of TTR-binding contaminants or their precursors in the arctic environment (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]). The measured TTR-binding activity correlated positively with the cubs' plasma levels of hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs). No such association was found between TTR-binding activity and the plasma levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs).

However, several studies pointed out the aquatic environment as the destination of perfluorinated compounds and their degradation products. The toxicity of per- and polyfluoroalkyl compounds (PFASs), especially the FSAs, raises environmental health concerns. In this study, the reproduction and body length of the aquatic microcrustaceans Daphnia similis were analyzed through the organisms’ exposure to two FSAs (Cold Fire® Suppressant Agent and Liovac®) in the following dilutions: 0.000093%, 0.0001875%, 0.000375%, 0.00075%, 0.0015%, 0.0003125%, 0.000625%, 0.01025%, 0.025%, and 0.005%, respectively. Our results showed that exposure to FSA caused inhibitory effects on the reproduction of Daphnia similis. The LOEC and NOEC of Cold Fire® were respectively 0.0001875% and 0.000093%, and significant chronic toxicity (p < 0.05) was observed at 0.0015 to 0.0001875% concentrations. The mean body lengths of surviving organisms exposed to all dilutions of Cold Fire® were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than the control organisms. For Liovac®, the respective LOEC and NOEC were 0.005% and 0.0025%. No significant differences were observed (p < 0.05) in the length of the organisms exposed to the Liovac®, compared to the control. The adverse effects on D. similis were observed at concentrations lower than those recommended by the manufacturers.

In the present study, we used PFOA-exposed mouse model together with comparative transcriptomic analysis to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the immunotoxicity of PFOA. Furthermore, we investigated the possible use of vitamin C to reverse the PFOA-induced immunotoxicity in spleen. Our result showed that the PFOA exposure could reduce the spleen weight and plasma lymphocytes, and the splenic comparative transcriptomic analysis highlighted the alteration of cell proliferation, metabolism and immune response through the regulation of gene clusters including nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases (NNT) and lymphocyte antigen 6 family member D and K (LY6D and LY6K). More importantly, the supplementation of vitamin C would relieve the PFOA-reduced spleen index and white blood cells. The bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome suggested its involvement in the spleen cell proliferation and immune response.

Besides, the amphiphilic properties of fluorinated compounds such as PFOS and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) suggest a role in increasing cell membrane permeability and solubilizing chemicals. The present study aimed at investigating whether PFOS and PFHxA are capable of modifying the activation of PCB126 toxicity-related pathways. For this purpose, zebrafish embryos were exposed in semi-static conditions to 7.5 μg/L of PCB126 alone, in the presence of 25 mg/L of PFOS, 15.7 mg/L of PFHxA or in the presence of both PFOS and PFHxA. Quantitative PCR was performed on embryos aged from 24 h post fertilization (hpf) to 96 hpf to investigate expression changes of genes involved in metabolism of xenobiotics (ahr2, cyp1a), oxidative stress (gpx1a, tp53), lipids metabolism (acaa2, osbpl1a), and epigenetic mechanisms (dnmt1, dnmt3ba). Cyp1a and ahr2 expression were significantly induced by the presence of PCB126. However, after 72 and 78 h of exposure, induction of cyp1a expression was significantly lower when embryos were co-exposed to PCB126 + PFOS + PFHxA when compared to PCB126-exposed embryos. Significant upregulation of gpx1a occurred after exposure to PCB126 + PFHxA and to PCB126 + PFOS + PFHxA at 30 and 48 hpf. Besides, embryos appeared more sensitive to PCB126 + PFOS + PFHxA at 78 hpf: acaa2 and osbpl1a were significantly downregulated; dnmt1 was significantly upregulated. While presented as environmentally safe, PFHxA demonstrated that it could affect gene expression patterns in zebrafish embryos when combined to PFOS and PCB126, suggesting that such mixture may increase PCB126 toxicity. This is of particular relevance since PFHxA is persistent and still being ejected into the environment. Moreover, it provides additional information as to the importance to integrate mixture effects of chemicals in risk assessment and biomonitoring frameworks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.232,Biochemistry;PFAS;Physiology;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Genes;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;Mixture toxicity;Mixtures;animal experiment;controlled study;Organic pollutants;polychlorinated biphenyl;persistent organic pollutant;lipid;lipid metabolism;Lipids;water pollutant;Gene expression;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;oxidative stress;surfactant;gene;gene expression;genetics;perfluorohexanoic acid;Risk assessment;toxicity;Toxicity;drug effect;PCB;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Cytology;embryo;Caproates;metabolism;down regulation;zebra fish;polymerase chain reaction;upregulation;Zebrafish;Metabolism;nonmammalian embryo;gene expression regulation;Gene Expression Regulation;cyprinid;Danio rerio;Polymerase chain reaction;hexanoic acid derivative;xenobiotic agent;epigenetics;Embryo;Water Pollutants;Developmental;Chemical;4;4';5;3;Nonmammalian;3';5 pentachlorobiphenyl;cyp1a gene;cyp1a;4'-pentachlorobiphenyl;acaa2 gene;ahr2 gene;Cyp1a;dnmt1 gene;dnmt3ba gene;gpx1a gene;Molecular pathway;Molecular pathways;osbpl1a gene;tumor suppressor gene;Gene Expression;Sulfones;Sulfonic Acids,NA,NA

At defined periodic intervals during the uptake and wash-out, fish were sampled for liquid scintillation counting and whole body autoradiography to profile the bioconcentration and tissue distribution of PFOA. The steady-state concentration of 14C-PFOA in the zebrafish was reached within 20-30 days of exposure. The concentration-time course of 14C-PFOA displayed a bi-exponential decline during washout, with a terminal half-life of approximately 13-14 days. At steady-state the bioconcentration of 14C-PFOA into whole-body fish was approximately 20-30 times greater than that of the exposure concentration, with no differences between females and males. The bioconcentration factors for liver and intestine were approximately 100-fold of the exposure medium, while in brain, ovary and gall bladder the accumulation factors were in the range 15-20. Whole-body autoradiograms confirmed the highest labeling of PFOA in bile and intestines, which implies enterohepatic circulation of PFOA. The 14C-PFOA was also observed in maturing vitellogenic oocytes, suggesting chemical accumulation via yolk proteins into oocytes with plausible risk for adverse effects on early embryonic development and offspring health. The bioconcentration at several 14C-PFOA exposure concentrations were also investigated (0.3-30μg/L). This showed that bioconcentration increased linearly with tank exposure in the present in vivo model under steady-state conditions.

Spatial trends in plasma contamination were observed for PFCs, PCBs, and OH-PCBs with the highest concentrations detected in plasma of dolphins sampled around Charleston, South Carolina. The detection of fluorotelomer carboxylic acids in dolphin plasma supported the hypothesis that fluorotelomer alcohols could be responsible for the long-range transport of PFCs. The concentrations of PFCs in plasma were not associated with gender but decreased with the age of animals. Sexually immature and developing calves were indeed more contaminated than mothers. The reproductive history of females was found to be associated with PFC concentrations and PFCs were found in milk of dolphins. These chemicals were detected in all organs of dolphins analyzed. The lack of temporal or seasonal trends in the concentrations suggested a continuous exposure of dolphins to these contaminants. The detection of PFCs in urine indicated excretion through the urinary system. Seawater and sediment from South Carolina and western Florida were contaminated with PFCs and the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of numerous PFCs in the bottlenose dolphin food web was observed. The results have also shown that, compared to the whole body burden estimation, using plasma or liver concentrations in dolphins tended to overestimate the biomagnification of PFCs. The measurements of PCBs and OH-PCBs in plasma confirmed the results previously reported for PCBs in marine mammals and showed that OH-PCBs are major environmental contaminants in dolphins. The profile of PCB and OH-PCB contamination were similar within contaminant groups among locations suggesting similar biotransformation processes, albeit at different intensities. The analysis of plasma has shown that a wide spectrum of OH-PCBs is found in blood of bottlenose dolphins. However, only around 20% of OH-PCBs could be identified by comparison to authentic standards. In addition, a large proportion of OH-PCB (<54% of the total ΣOH-PCBs) were composed of monochloro- to trichloro-OH-PCBs which have rarely, if ever, been measured in biota. These findings indicated that OH-PCB concentrations are likely underestimated in samples. Further investigation is needed to better understand the fate and effects of these emerging organohalogen contaminants in marine mammals.",NA,NA,Zoology;Tursiops truncatus;Contaminants;Health;Oceanography;Organohalogen;Bottlenose dolphins;0416:Biological oceanography;0472:Zoology;0768:Environmental science;Biological oceanography;Biological sciences;Environmental science;environmental sciences,NA,NA

In the present study, the comparative accumulation of C6 to C15 PFCAs, C4, C 6, C8 and C10 PFSAs, and select precursors were examined in the liver, blood, muscle, adipose, and brain of 20 polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Scoresby Sound, Central East Greenland. Overall, PFSA and PFCA concentrations were highest in liver followed by blood > brain > muscle ≈ adipose. Liver and blood samples contained proportionally more of the shorter/medium chain length (C6 to C11) PFCAs, whereas adipose and brain samples were dominated by longer chain (C13 to C15) PFCAs. PFCAs with lower lipophilicities accumulated more in the liver, whereas the brain accumulated PFCAs with higher lipophilicities.

Exposure to PFAS, particularly perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA), has been associated with increased diabetes-related cardiovascular mortality in subjects residing areas of high environmental contamination, however the exact pathogenic mechanism remains elusive. Here we used HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocyte, to investigate the possible role of PFOA exposure in the alteration of hepatic glucose metabolism. HepG2 cells were exposed for 24 hours to PFOA at increasing concentration from 0 to 1000 ng/mL and then stimulated with 100 nm Insulin (Ins). The consequent effect on glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake and Glut-4 glucose transporter translocation was then evaluated by, respectively, Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake assay and immunofluorescence. Exposure to PFOA was associated with reduced glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake, at concentration equal or greater than, respectively, 0,1 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL, with parallel impaired membrane translocation of Glut-4 upon Ins stimulation. Western blot analysis showed early uncoupling of Insulin Receptor (InsR) activation from the downstream Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation. Computational docking analysis disclosed the possible stabilizing effect of PFOA on the complex between InsR and GM3 ganglioside, previously shown to be associated with the low grade chronic inflammation-related insulin resistance. Consistently, long term treatment with glucosyl-ceramide synthase inhibitor PDMP was able to largely restore glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake and Glut-4 translocation upon Ins stimulation in HepG2 exposed to PFOA.

In the present study, tissues of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) from two sites in southern Ontario, Canada, were analyzed for 17 individual PFAAs and showed egg and nestling tissue (liver, carcass) profiles dominated by PFOS (57-66%). The remaining PFAAs contributed <= 7% each, although collectively the long-chain PFCAs comprised 21-29% of the PFAAs. The short-chain PFSAs and PFCAs were among the lowest concentrations, suggesting that despite increased production and use of these alternative PFAAs, they are not accumulated to the same extent as the long-chain PFSAs and PFCAs. PFOS, PFDS, and some long-chain PFCAs were significantly higher in eggs than in livers and carcasses, whereas PFOA and the two short-chain PFCAs were significantly higher in nestling tissues than in eggs. For the two short-chain PFSAs, concentrations were similar among tissues. Tree swallow tissues at the site near a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outfall showed higher concentrations of PFOS, PFDS, PFHxS, and some long-chain PFCAs than tree swallows sampled at the nearby reference site; however, the influence of the WWTP was more equivocal for PFOA, other long-chain PFCAs, and short-chain PFSAs and PFCAs. Carbon stable isotopes (delta 13C) and fatty acid signatures indicated that the diets of the WWTP swallows were more terrestrial than the reference swallows. Nonetheless, models considering envi-ronmental and ecological variables indicated that site was often the primary driver of PFAA variation among the swallows, with less or no influence of dietary patterns, or sex or body condition, revealing that of WWTP effluent can be an important environmental source of the major PFAAs in tree swallows.",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121133,character(0),NA,NA

Exposure to EDs may result in adverse health effects such as infertility and cancer. EDs are composed of a vast group of chemicals including compounds of natural origin such as phytoestrogens or mycotoxins and a wide range of man-made chemicals such as pesticides. Synthetic compounds may find their way into the food chain where a number of them can biomagnify. Additionally, processing activities and food contact materials may add further to the already existing pool of food contaminants. Thus, our diet is considered to be one of the main exposure routes to EDs. Some precautionary legislation has already been introduced to control production and/or application of some persistent organic pollutants with ED characteristics. However, newly emerging EDs with bioaccumulative properties have recently been reported to appear at lower tiers of the food chain but have not been monitored at the grander scale. Milk and dairy products are a major component of our diet, thus it is important to monitor them for EDs. However, most methods developed to date are devoted to one group of compounds at a time. The UHPLC-MS/MS method described here has been validated according to EC decision 20021657/EC and allows simultaneous extraction, detection, quantitation and confirmation of 19 EDs in milk.

Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in women has been linked to pregnancy disorders and adverse birth outcomes, but no data are available on the relationship between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and postpartum haemorrhage. This study aimed to explore the associations of maternal PFAS exposure with the postpartum haemorrhage risk and total blood loss. A total of 1496 mother-infant pairs in the Guangxi Zhuang birth cohort were included between June 2015 and May 2018. The concentration of PFASs in serum was detected using ultrahigh liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Multiple binomial regression and linear regression models were used to analyse individual PFAS exposures. The mixture of PFASs was analysed using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR). In single substance exposure models, exposure to perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) increased the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (OR: 3.42, 95 % CI: 1.45, 8.07), while exposure to perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) was inversely associated with the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (OR: 0.42, 95 % CI: 0.22, 0.80).

Yet the effects of different types and concentrations of PFCs on soil microbial community in urban forest ecosystems are remain uncertain. Here, two typical PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), were selected to carry out a pot experiment in greenhouse with singly and joint treatment at different concentrations, to examine their effects on composition and diversity of soil microorganisms and availability of soil macronutrients by using high-throughput Illumina sequencing approach. The results showed both PFOA and PFOS application significantly increased soil NO3 –N and NH4 +-N content, but did not alter total phosphorus content, compared to the control check (CK) treatments. Total potassium content was reduced in PFOA treatments but increased in PFOS and PFOA×PFOS treatments. The most dominant bacterial phylum was Chloroflexi in low and medium PFCs concentrations and the CK treatments, but it was switched to Acidobacteria in high concentrations. No obvious change was detected for the composition of the dominant fungi community in PFCs treatments compared to the CK treatments. With the increase of PFCs concentrations, soil bacterial richness decreased but its diversity increased, whereas the richness and diversity of fungal community usually decreased. Redundancy analyses revealed that soil fungal community was more sensitive to PFCs pollutants than soil bacterial communities. Further data analysis revealed by structural equation model (SEM) that the PFCs exposed for 60 days indirectly affects the diversity and richness of soil bacteria and fungi by directly affecting NO3 –N and NH4 +-N content. The results suggested the concentration of PFCs pollutants played a primary role in determining the composition, richness and diversity of forest soil microbial communities. © 2022 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114458,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Article;Bacteria;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;perfluoro compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;urban area;Perfluorinated compounds;soil;Soil;soil pollution;chemical analysis;organofluorine;Caprylates;phosphorus;octanoic acid derivative;PFOA;catalase;genomic DNA;bacterium;biodiversity;environmental impact;soil pollutant;soil analysis;ammonia;high throughput sequencing;gene amplification;potassium;species diversity;structural equation modeling;Microbiota;microflora;community structure;microbial community;soil acidity;fungus;soil property;macronutrient;DNA extraction;species composition;Acidobacteria;Bacterial;bacterial structures;chemical property;Chloroflexi;DNA sequencing;forest;forest soil;Forests;fungal communities;fungal community;fungal structures;greenhouse;illumina sequencing;nitrate;phosphatase;redundancy analysis;soil microflora;species richness;urease;Trees,NA,NA

However, difficulties associated with the analysis of PFAAs at ultra trace levels in food samples have prevented the confirmation of this hypothesis. In this study, the dietary intake of PFAAs for the general Swedish population was estimated by applying a highly sensitive analytical method to a set of archived food market basket samples from 1999, 2005 and 2010. Dietary exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (860-1440pgkg-1day-1), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) (90-210pgkg-1day-1), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) (50-110pgkg-1day-1) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (70-80pgkg-1day-1) was dominated by the consumption of fish and meat. In contrast, dietary exposure to PFOA (350-690pgkg-1day-1) originated from low levels (8-62pgg-1) found in several high consumption food categories including cereals, dairy products, vegetables and fruit. The dietary intakes of PFOS and PFOA estimated in this study were 4 to 10 times lower compared to previous exposure modeling studies. Nevertheless, the dietary intake of PFOS and PFOA was still a factor of 6 to 10 higher than exposure through ingestion of household dust and drinking water estimated for the general Swedish population. For perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) drinking water intake was the major exposure pathway (36-53% of the total exposure) whereas dust ingestion made a significant contribution (27-49%) to the total exposure for PFHxA, PFHpA, PFNA, perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) and perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeDA). Dietary intakes varied by less than a factor of three for all PFAAs during the different sampling years which demonstrates that dietary intake has been fairly constant over the past decade when many manufacturing changes occurred. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2012.08.016,Perfluoroalkyl acids;PFOS;Sweden;Human exposures;diet;Dietary intake;Dietary intakes;Nutrition;drinking water;food intake;food consumption;organic acid;PFOA;Human exposure;anthropogenic effect;Dairy products;Trace analysis;analytical method,NA,NA

Because of the excellent thermal stability, high surface activity, lipophobicity and hydrophobicity, they are widely used in different fields such as non-stick coatings, dental floss, and aqueous film-forming foams. PFASs inevitably enter the environments by industrial and domestic emissions, and exist stably in the environment. In recent years, PFASs pollution becomes a global environmental problem. Microorganisms are an indispensable part of the ecosystems, acting as an important participant in the material cycle and energy flow. Both microbial surfaces and PFASs are relatively hydrophobic, and hydrophobic interaction facilitates PFASs to contact microorganisms, which further inhibit their activity. In turn, microorganisms could affect the transformation and fate of PFASs. Therefore, it is of importance to systematically summarize the interaction between PFASs and microorganisms in order to provide critical information for better understanding the environmental risks of PFASs. This review systematically expounded the interaction between PFASs and environmental microorganisms. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of PFASs to bacteria was highlighted. It was found that PFASs could promote the synthesis and release of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and affect the composition and structure of EPS, thereby inhibiting the activity of extracellular enzymes or destroying the integrity of biofilm. In addition, hydrophobic interaction promoted the penetration of PFASs to the phospholipid bilayer, increasing the fluidity and permeability of the membrane. Furthermore, the increase of membrane permeability caused bacterial metabolism disorder, which resulted in the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS could oxidize unsaturated fatty acids to malondialdehyde (MDA), and induce cross-linking of nucleic acids and lead to DNA damage. Secondly, this review elucidated the impact of PFASs on the microbial communities in the environments. In the soil and freshwater environments, the changes of bacterial abundance are mainly regulated by PFASs concentrations. It is worth noting that PFASs at high concentration (>10 mg/kg) reduced the abundance of bacteria related to soil nitrogen transformation and phosphorus metabolism, thus posing a potential threat to the cycling capacities of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. Additionally, sulfur cycle and nitrification process in freshwater environment are inhibited by high-concentration PFASs (>10 mg/L). In terms of the marine environment, the impact of PFASs on microbial communities was much lower than that of environmental parameters (e.g., nutrient substances and salinity). Finally, the microbial transformation pathway of PFASs was discussed. The biofilm formed by microorganisms and their extracellular secretions could adsorb and transform/degrade PFASs by different reactions (e.g., Feammox, desulfurization and hydrolysis), mediating by extracellular enzymes (e.g., C-SO3− bond lyase, phosphatase and polyurethane enzyme), thus affecting the toxicity and fate of PFASs. Moreover, the challenges and future perspectives were addressed. PFASs in the biofilm could be transferred to the organisms at higher trophic level through the parasitic or predatory food chains. Therefore, the risk of PFASs along the microbe-based food chain should be further investigated. In addition, microorganisms existed in the environments usually in the form of community. Current research on the molecular mechanisms of PFASs on microbial quorum sensing is relatively lacking, and deserves an in-depth investigation. Finally, due to the lack of some metabolite standards and instrument detection limit, there are still unidentified transformation products in the biotransformation pathways of PFASs. The issues highlighted above are suggested to be focused on the further investigations. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This study investigated the combined effects of polystyrene (PS) MNPs and PFOS on soybean (Glycine max) sprouts, which are common hydroponic vegetable. Results demonstrated that the adsorption of PFOS on PS particles transformed free PFOS into adsorbed state and reduced its bioavailability and potential migration, thus attenuating acute toxic effects such as oxidative stress. TEM and Laser confocal microscope images showed that PS nanoparticles uptake in sprout tissue was enhanced by the adsorption of PFOS which is because of changes of the particle surface properties. Transcriptome analysis showed that PS and PFOS exposure promoted soybean sprouts to adapt to environmental stress and MARK pathway might play an important role in recognition of microplastics coated by PFOS and response to enhancing plant resistance.

Sewage markers revealed that the surface runoff was a significant source of perfluorocarboxylates in the bay during wet weather. This finding leads to a greater understanding of sources and pathways of perfluorocarboxylates in waters. AbstractWe investigated the occurrence of perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) in Tokyo Bay during dry and wet weather and evaluated the contributions of wastewater effluent, untreated wastewater, and surface runoff by using two sewage markers, caffeine and crotamiton. ∑8PFCAs ranged from 11 to 185ngL-1. Perfluorononanoate (PFNA) was the major species, followed by perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA). Principal component analysis followed by multiple linear regression revealed that the PFCAs were derived mainly from wastewater effluent during dry weather, and jointly from wastewater effluent (59%) and combined sewer overflow (41%) during wet weather. We used caffeine-to-crotamiton ratios to evaluate the contributions of untreated wastewater and wastewater effluent. Estimated concentrations of wastewater-derived PFCAs were much lower than observed concentrations during wet weather, indicating the contribution of surface runoff to contamination. During a combined sewer overflow, surface runoff had a significant effect on contamination in the bay. © 2011 CSIRO.",NA,10.1071/EN10130,wastewater;chemical pollutant;Japan;principal component analysis;surfactant;pollution effect;aquatic organism;marine pollution;tracer;runoff;nonpoint source pollution;pharmaceuticals;combined sewer overflow (CSO);diffuse pollution;Honshu;Kanto;non-point source;perfluorinated surfactants (PFSs);perfluorochemicals (PFCs);personal care products (PPCPs);Tokyo Bay;wastewater tracer.;weather modification,NA,NA

Previous studies have showed that PFOS gestational exposure is associated with offspring lung damage in rat. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of gasdermin E (GSDME) in lung injury of offspring and its underlying mechanisms using in vivo and in vitro approaches. Pregnant SD rats were exposed to PFOS (1 mg/kg BW/d) between gestational day 12–18, and the lung tissue of the offspring was evaluated on postnatal day 7. PFOS treated animals exhibited alveolar septal thickening and inflammation-related damages, with an increased expression of GSDME in alveolar type II epithelial cells (AECII). Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated that PFOS exposure (with 225 μM and up) upregulated the caspase-3/GSDME signaling pathway in AECII. Also, ultrastructure analysis revealed significant changes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure in PFOS-induced pyroptotic cells, which is consistent with the ER stress detected in these cells. Additionally, PFOS exposure led to increased expression of ER stress-related proteins, including p-PERK, p-eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP. Subsequently, using specific inhibitors, we found that the PERK/ATF4 pathway acted as an upstream signal regulating GSDME-dependent pyroptosis. Overall, our findings show that GSDME-dependent pyroptosis plays a crucial role in the lung injury induced by gestational PFOS exposure, and the PERK/ATF4 pathway may function as a possible mediator of this process. © 2023, The Author(s).",NA,10.1007/s00204-023-03626-w,Animals;Article;Rats;Signal Transduction;animal;female;male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;in vitro study;in vivo study;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;progeny;metabolism;prenatal exposure;animal cell;animal model;rat;signal transduction;lung parenchyma;caspase 3;Sprague Dawley rat;Caspase 3;lung injury;endoplasmic reticulum stress;Sprague-Dawley;activating transcription factor 4;Activating Transcription Factor 4;alveolar type II epithelial cell;cell ultrastructure;DNA damage inducible protein 153;endoplasmic reticulum;Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress;Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2;gasdermin;gasdermin E;growth arrest;GSDME;initiation factor 2;initiation factor 2alpha;lung alveolus epithelium cell;Lung injury;Lung Injury;PERK/ATF4 pathway;phosphotransferase;protein kinase RNA like ER kinase;pyroptosis;Pyroptosis;Transcription Factor CHOP;Ketanserin;Interleukin-3;Sumatriptan;Caspases,NA,NA

PFOA and PFOS levels were analyzed using ultrasonic extraction with methanol and solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Retail milk and yogurt samples present higher detection rates (39.6% and 48.1%) and mean concentrations (24.5 and 31.8 ng/L) of PFOS than those of PFOA (33.0% and 37.0%; 16.2 and 22.6 ng/L, respectively).

PFASs in soil can affect water quality when they leach into groundwater, and threaten the ecosystem and human health through trophic transfer and magnification along the terrestrial food chains, which make them one of the hot research topics in environmental chemistry. At present, the content of less than 1% of the total fluorinated compounds in the soil can be accurately determined, and the content is at the ng/g level. The research areas in China are concentrated in the east and the surrounding areas of fluorochemical plants. The main compounds of PFASs in soil are PFOS and PFOA. The physicochemical properties of soil, species of PFASs and human activities are the main factors influencing the occurrence of PFASs in different types of soil. In addition to the direct release and atmospheric transport during the production and use of fluorinated chemicals, PFASs precursor conversion in soil is also an important source of PFASs. Adsorption-desorption is the major process affecting the transport of PFASs in soil. Studies also demonstrate that the transport and accumulation of PFASs in soil are affected by various factors such as the chain-length and functional groups of PFASs, soil physicochemical properties and microorganisms. In consideration of the research status, further development of extraction and analytical methods is needed to cover a wider range of PFASs.

In the present study, we examined nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)-mediated oxidative stress pathways in zebrafish embryos upon exposure to PFOS. Four-hour postfertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0 mg/l PFOS until 96 hpf. PFOS enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a concentration-dependent manner. Activity of antioxidative enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, was significantly induced in zebrafish larvae in all PFOS-treated groups relative to the control. Exposure to 1.0 mg/l PFOS significantly increased malondialdehyde production in zebrafish larvae. The Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene expressions were both significantly upregulated compared with the control group. For MAPKs, we investigated gene expression profiles of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH (2)-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. The ERK gene expression levels were unchanged, whereas JNK and p38 gene expressions were significantly upregulated, which could be linked to PFOS-induced cell apoptosis in zebrafish larvae. In addition, we found that coexposure with sulforaphane, an Nrf2 activator, could significantly protect against PFOS-induced ROS generation, whereas inhibition of MAPKs did not exhibit significant effects on PFOS-induced HO-1 gene expression and ROS production. Furthermore, we showed that morpholino-mediated knockdown of Nrf2 reduced PFOS-induced HO-1 gene expression. These findings demonstrate that Nrf2 is protective against PFOS-induced oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae. © The Author 2010.

We present here a transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish embryos exposed to different concentrations of PFOS (0.03–1.0 mg/L) from 48 to 120 hpf. No major survival or morphological alterations (swimming bladder inflation, kyphosis, eye separation and size…) were observed below the 1.0 mg/L mark. Conversely, we observed significant increase in transcripts related to lipid transport and metabolism even at the lowest used concentration. In addition, we observed a general decrease on transcripts related to natural immunity and defense again infections, which adds to the recent concerns about PFOS as immunotoxicant, particularly in humans. Derived PoD (Point of Departure) values for transcriptional changes (0.011 mg/L) were about 200-fold lower than the corresponding PoD values for morphometric effects (2.53 mg/L), and close to levels observed in human blood serum or bird eggs.

In the last 10 years, there has been accumulating evidence that diatoms may have deleterious effects on the hatching success of zooplankton crustaceans such as copepods, thus affecting dynamics of planktonic populations and limiting secondary production. At the molecular level, failure to hatch is ascribed to the presence of a family of inhibitory oxylipins, which we propose to collectively name polyunsaturated short-chain aldehydes (abbreviated here as PUSCAs). Here we describe the origin of PUSCAs produced by the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum via a lipoxygenase-mediated pathways involving non-esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Experiments with complex lipids proved the pivotal role of chloroplast-derived glycolipids, especially monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), in providing hexadecatrienoic acid (C16:3 omega-4), hexadecatetraenoic acid (C16:4 omega-1) and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 omega-3) to the downstream process leading to 2E,4Z-octadienal (C8:2 omega-4), 2E,4Z, 7-octatrienal (C8:3 omega-1) and 2E,4Z-heptadienal (C7:2 omega-3), respectively.

We use directly radiocarbon dated bones of introduced dogs (Canis familiaris) to test whether dogs could have aided human-led hunts of the island's extinct megafauna. We compare carbon and nitrogen isotope data from the bone collagen of dogs and endemic ""fosa"" (Cryptoprocta spp.) in central and southwestern Madagascar to test for competition between introduced and endemic predators. The distinct isotopic niches of dogs and fosa suggest that any past antagonistic relationship between these predators did not follow from predation or competition for shared prey. Radiocarbon dates confirm that dogs have been present on Madagascar for over a millennium and suggest that they at least briefly co-occurred with the island's extinct megafauna, which included giant lemurs, elephant birds, and pygmy hippopotamuses. Today, dogs share a mutualism with pastoralists who also occasionally hunt endemic vertebrates, and similar behavior is reflected in deposits at several Malagasy paleontological sites that contain dog and livestock bones along with butchered bones of extinct megafauna and extant lemurs. Dogs on Madagascar have had a wide range of diets during the past millennium, but relatively high stable carbon isotope values suggest few individuals relied primarily on forest bushmeat.

Concentrations of substances in these livestock products are often estimated using log-log regressions that relate the biotransfer factor BTF to the octanol-water partition ratio K-ow. However, the correctness of these empirical correlations has been questioned. Here. we compare them to the mechanistic model OMEGA that describes the distribution of substances in organisms by integrating theory on chemical fugacity and biological allometry. OMEGA has been calibrated and validated on thousands of laboratory and field data, reflecting many chemical substances and biological species. Overall fluxes of water, food, tissue (growth), milk and stable substances calculated by OMEGA are within a factor of two from independent data obtained in experiments. Rate constants measured for elimination of individual compounds of a recalcitrant nature vary around the level expected from the model for output to faeces and milk. Both data and model suggest that biotransfer BTF of stable substances to beef and milk is independent of the octanol-water partition ratio K-ow in the range of 10(3)-10(6). This contradicts empirical regressions including stable and labile compounds. As expected, levels of labile substances vary widely around a tentative indication derived from the model. Transformation and accumulation of labile substances remains highly specific for the chemical and organism concerned but depends weakly on the octanol-water partition ratio K-ow.

We analyzed blood from 15 herring gulls from each colony-the urban Oslofjord near the Norwegian capital Oslo in the temperate region and the remote Hornoya island in northern Norway, on the Barents Sea coast. Based on d(13)C and d(34)S, the dietary sources of urban gulls differed, with some individuals having a marine and others a more terrestrial dietary signal. All remote gulls had a marine dietary signal and higher relative trophic level than the urban marine feeding gulls.

Contamination of the river with mercury and lead rapidly followed settlement of the basin by European immigrants in the mid-1800s. Metal contamination peaked in the 1960s and has since decreased substantially. DDT, its degradation product DDE, and PCBs biomagnified to concentrations that adversely affected wildlife in upper trophic levels. National (U.S.A.) environmental regulations enacted from 1972 to 1991 reduced discharges of wastes from point sources, improved wastewater treatment, and reduced or banned the production or usage of certain chemicals, such as DDT, PCBs, and lead. Responses to these regulatory measures include reductions in ecosystem contamination, reductions in biotic exposure, and recovery of affected wildlife populations. Recovery from pollution has been slow, however, and we conclude that proactive approaches focusing on prevention are highly preferable to reactive approaches in management of toxic substances. Past successes in reducing point-source pollution, which is greatest near urban areas, do not extend to nonpoint-source pollution, given that the existing regulatory framework does not adequately address nonpoint sources. The river continues to receive hundreds of recently synthesized chemicals, and the behavior and effects of most of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems are largely unknown.

A number of methods may be used to detect specific oxidized fatty acids containing a single or multiple combinations of epoxide, hydroxyl, ketone, and hydroperoxide moieties on varying carbon chain lengths from C8 up to C30. Some of these methods are nonspecific and their use in biological systems is fraught with difficulty. Measures of specific oxidized fatty acid derivatives help in identifying oxidation pathways in pathological processes. We used liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry as an efficient, selective, and sensitive method for identifying and analyzing multiple specific fatty acid peroxidation products in human plasma and other biological matrices. We then distilled the essential components of a number of these analyses to provide an efficient protocol by which fatty acid oxidation products and their parent compounds can be determined. In this protocol, addition of a synthetic internal standard to the sample, followed by base hydrolysis at elevated temperature and liquid-liquid phase sample extraction with lighter-than-water solvents, facilitates isolation of the oxidized fatty acid species. These species can be identified and accurately quantified using stable-isotope dilution and multiple-reaction monitoring.

Besides those methods, the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay has proved useful to estimate the contribution of unattributed perfluoroalkyl acids precursors (pre-PFAAs). In this study, an optimized extraction method was developed to examine the spatial distribution of 36 targeted PFAS in surface sediments collected at French nationwide scale (n = 43), including neutral, anionic and zwitterionic molecules. In addition, a TOP assay procedure was implemented to estimate the contribution of unattributed pre-PFAAs in these samples. Conversion yields of targeted pre-PFAAs were determined for the first time under realistic conditions and led to differences in oxidation profiles compared to the common spiked ultra-pure water method. PFAS were detected in 86 % of samples and ∑PFAStargeted was in the range < Limit of Detection – 23 ng g−1 dry weight (dw) (median: 1.3 ng g−1 dw), with ∑pre-PFAAstargeted representing on average 29 ± 26 % of ∑PFAS.

High-dose exposure to PFOA has been associated with increased risks of infertility and premature ovarian insufficiency in woman. PFOA can alter hepatic gene expression by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). The present study investigated whether exposure to PFOA via PPARα activation alters the synthesis of hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) to disturb female neuroendocrine and reproductive function. In the present study, we show that the oral administration of PFOA (2 or 5 mg kg-1) in adult female mice (PFOA mice) caused prolonged dioestrous, a reduction in the number of corpora lutea and decreased levels of hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, serum progesterone and luteinising hormone (LH). Exposure to PFOA decreased the expression of vasopressin in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and kisspeptin in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) with deficits in preovulation or oestrogen-induced LH surge. PFOA via activation of PPARα increased dose-dependently hepatic FGF21 expression, leading to elevated serum and hypothalamic FGF21 concentrations. Treatment of PFOA mice with the PPARα antagonist GW6471 or the FGF21 inhibitor PD173074 rescued SCN vasopressin and AVPV-kisspeptin expression. Either administration of GW6471 and PD173074 or treatment with vasopressin and the G protein coupled receptor 54 agonist kisspeptin-10 in PFOA-mice was able to recover the regular oestrous cycle, ovulation ability, LH surge production and reproductive hormone levels. The present study provides in vivo evidence that exposure to PFOA (≥2 mg kg-1) in mice causes down-regulation of the kisspeptin-reproductive endocrine system by enhancing PPARα-mediated hepatic FGF21 expression.

The current study monitored a survey of 23 PFASs in 1049 aquatic products from the coasts of the Yellow-Bohai Sea in China to comprehensively investigate the concentrations and distributions of PFASs. PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFOSA, and PFUdA were more predominantly and frequently detected than other PFASs in all samples, dominating PFAS patterns in aquatic products. The mean levels of ∑PFASs in different species followed the order: marine shellfish > marine crustaceans > fish > cephalopods > sea cucumber. Profiles of PFASs differ between species, suggesting species-specific accumulation plays a role. Various aquatic species are potential environmental bioindicators that signal individual PFAS contamination. For instance, clams can act as a potential PFOA bioindicator. High ∑PFAS levels in some sites (such as Binzhou, Dongying, Cangzhou, and Weifang) could be attributed to industrial activities involving fluoropolymer manufacture. The differences between PFAS concentrations and profiles in aquatic products across the study regions have been proposed as PFAS fingerprints of the Yellow-Bohai Sea coasts. Analyses of principal components and Spearman correlations indicated that the precursor biodegradation possibly contribute to C8–C10 PFCAs in the study samples. This study reported a wide presence of PFASs in different species of aquatic products across the Yellow-Bohai Sea coasts. The potential health risks that PFASs pose in certain species (such as marine shellfish and marine crustaceans) should not be neglected. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121514,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFASs;chemical pollutant;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;China;animal;concentration (parameter);fluorocarbon;Marine pollution;nonhuman;controlled study;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;Health risks;water pollutant;bioindicator;Biomarkers;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;principal component analysis;Principal component analysis;quality control;concentration (composition);alkanesulfonic acid;water pollution;Emerging contaminant;human;Pacific Ocean;perfluorononanoic acid;health hazard;chemical composition;aquatic environment;coastal waters;bioremediation;shellfish;Shellfish;Molluscs;coastal zone;marine pollution;Crustacea;Water Pollutants;Biodegradation;Chemical;Human health;Environmental Biomarkers;environmental marker;crustacean;cephalopod;Aquatic products;Bohai Sea;Concentration;Concentrations;Profile;Profiles;Region;Regions;Sea coast;sea cucumber;Species;Yellow Sea,NA,NA

While highly chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins are persistent under oxic conditions, in anoxic environments, these organohalogens can be reductively dechlorinated to less chlorinated compounds that are then more amenable to subsequent aerobic degradation. Identifying the microorganisms responsible for dechlorination is an important step in developing bioremediation approaches. In this study, we demonstrated the use of a DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) approach to identify the bacteria active in dechlorination of PCDDs in river sediments, with 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1,2,3,4-TeCDD) as a model. In addition, pyrosequencing of reverse transcribed 16S rRNA of TeCDD dechlorinating enrichment cultures was used to reveal active members of the bacterial community. A set of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) responded positively to the addition of 1,2,3,4-TeCDD in SIP microcosms assimilating C-13-acetate as the carbon source. Analysis of bacterial community profiles of the C-13 labeled heavy DNA fraction revealed that an OTU corresponding to Dehalococcoides mccartyi accounted for a significantly greater abundance in cultures amended with 1,2,3,4-TeCDD than in cultures without 1,2,3,4-TeCDD. This implies the involvement of this Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain in the reductive dechlorination of 1,2,3,4-TeCDD and suggests the applicability of SIP for a robust assessment of the bioremediation potential of organohalogen contaminated sites.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.9b05395,character(0),NA,NA

The sum concentrations for eight quantifiable PFAS (∑8PFAS) in surface waters ranged from 11 to 69 pg/L, which is lower than previously reported in the same area as well as in higher latitudes. Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were the predominant PFASs present in the Western TAO. The 16 surface samples showed variable PFAS distributions, with the predominance of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) along the transect (67%; 11 ± 8 pg/L) and detection of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) only in the Southern TAO. Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) was often detected in the vertical profiles. PFAS distribution patterns (i.e., profiles and concentrations) varied with depth throughout the TAO latitudinal sectors (North, Equator, South Atlantic, and in the Brazilian coastal zone). Vertical profiles in coastal samples displayed decreasing PFAS concentrations with increasing depth, whereas offshore samples displayed higher PFAS detection frequencies in the intermediate water masses.

Total fluorine determination has revealed that a substantial amount of fluorinated organic compounds has not been identified. Due to the small mass deficiency of fluorine, it is not an easy task to screen successfully all fluorinated compounds including those which are not easy ionisable, hence a novel fluorine-specific detector is needed. Here, inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) was used for the first time for the detection of PFAS, by using the novel approach to transfer F− into a detectable [BaF]+ in the argon plasma. A reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and then online coupled to ICPMS/MS for the fluorine-specific detection and simultaneously to electrospray MS (ESI-MS) to separate perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). The calibration was linear and was element-specific with detection limits of 0.49 mg F L−1 under gradient elution method. As a proof of concept, PFCA standards in methanol were not fully neutralised to force the esterification and those solutions were measured using HPLC-ICPMS/MS-ESI-MS. The methyl esters were not detectable by ESI-MS but by ICPMS/MS. This illustrates that the undetectable fluorine-containing compounds were detected and quantified by the element-specific detection of ICPMS/MS. The analysis of spiked river water at sub-ppb level gave an acceptable recovery using a SPE-based preconcentration method. Since ICPMS/MS method is an element-specific detection, all non-fluorinated compounds interfering in ESI-MS were eliminated. Hence, HPLC-ICPMS/MS can be used as a non-targeted method of fluorinated compounds which helps the identification of novel fluorinated compounds in environmental and biological samples and helps with mining the ESI-MS data. © 2018",NA,10.1016/j.aca.2018.11.037,"Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;concentration (parameter);unclassified drug;controlled study;perfluoro compound;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;high performance liquid chromatography;solid phase extraction;perfluorohexanoic acid;priority journal;chemical analysis;perfluorononanoic acid;Perfluorinated carboxylic acids;perfluoroheptanoic acid;electrospray mass spectrometry;limit of quantitation;limit of detection;perfluorocarboxylic acid;reproducibility;process optimization;methanol;acetonitrile;High performance liquid chromatography;Esters;fluorine;Mass spectrometers;elution;organic solvent;Environmental;inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry;deprotonation;esterification;biological samples;ICPMS/MS;Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometries (ICPMS);Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry;methyl perfluorooctanoic acid;Non-target method;Polyatomic ion;Polyatomic ion [BaF]<sup>+</sup>;Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography;Multiple Sclerosis;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid",NA,NA

Sea urchins dropped spines, and lowered down the motor ability and feeding ability after the PFOS exposure. Superoxide dismutase activities in supernatant of coelomic fluid of sea urchin increased firstly and then dropped down, while the change of the catalase activity took an opposite trend during the exposure period. They both approached to the corresponding activity of the control after the depuration period. The DNA methylation polymorphism, methylation rate and demethylation rate in sea urchin gonad all increased following the prolonged exposure time, and then decreased after the depuration period. The demethylation rates were lower than the corresponding methylation rates, therefore methylation events were dominant during the whole experimental period. This might suggest that sea urchin have strong self-protection mechanisms and can survive from the PFOS exposure presented in this study.

Although ""total PFOS"" (Sigma PFOS) analytical methods continue to be the most commonly used for quantification, recent analytical method developments have made it possible to resolve the various isomers of PFOS by HPLC-MS/MS, Characterized technical PFOS standards (i.e,, containing a mixture of PFOS isomers) are now available that enable isomer specific quantification of PFOS, however the advantages of such an analysis have not yet been examined systematically. Herein, PFOS isomers have been individually quantified for the first time in real samples and the results are compared to a traditional Sigma PFOS method; the influence of analytical standards and isomer specific electrospray and MS/MS behavior were also investigated. The two human serum standard reference materials chosen for analysis contained dramatically different PFOS isomer profiles (similar to 30-50% total branched isomers) emphasizing that isomer patterns should not be ignored and may provide useful information on exposure sources (i.e., direct exposure to PFOS vs indirect exposure from PFOS-precursors). Depending on the sample and the particular MS/MS transition chosen for Sigma PFOS analysis (i.e., 499-80 or 499-99), Sigma PFOS concentrations may be over- or underestimated compared to the isomer specific analysis. Differences in the extent of in-source fragmentation and MS/MS dissociation contributed to the systematic analytical bias. It was also shown that Sigma PFOS data are prone to interlaboratory variation due to various choices of PFOS standards and instrumental conditions used. In the future, for either Sigma PFOS or isomer specific PFOS analyses, we suggest that accuracy can be maximized and interlaboratory discrepancies minimized by using a common chemically pure technical PFOS standard characterized by (19)F NMR.",NA,10.1021/es901261v,"Chromatography;High Pressure Liquid;Multiple Sclerosis;Sulfones;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid",NA,NA

However, few studies have specifically assessed the effects of PFOS on inflammation. This study utilized a standard 60-day oral exposure period to assess the effects of PFOS on the response of inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)]. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were dosed daily by oral gavage with PFOS at 0, 0.0083, 0.0167, 0.0833, 0.4167, 0.8333 or 2.0833 mg/kg/day to yield a targeted Total Administered Dose (TAD) over 60 days of 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 25, 50, or 125 mg PFOS/kg, respectively. The percentage of peritoneal macrophages (CD11b+ cells) was significantly increased at concentrations ≥1 mg PFOS/kg TAD in a dose-dependent manner. Ex vivo IL-1β production by peritoneal macrophages was elevated substantially at concentrations of ≥5 mg PFOS/kg TAD. Moreover, PFOS exposure markedly enhanced the ex vivo production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 by peritoneal and splenic macrophages when stimulated either in vitro or in vivo with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The serum levels of these inflammatory cytokines observed in response to in vivo stimulation with LPS were elevated substantially by exposure to PFOS. PFOS exposure elevated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and proto-oncogene, c-myc, in the spleen. These data suggest that exposure to PFOS modulates the inflammatory response, and further research is needed to determine the mechanism of action. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,10.1002/tox.20642,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Cytokines;chemical pollutant;Animals;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Mice;environmental exposure;male;Male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;mouse;Mammals;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;pollution exposure;adult;gene expression;chronic toxicity;toxicity;serum;article;body weight;dose-response relationship;priority journal;food intake;protein blood level;animal cell;animal model;spleen cell;toxicity testing;flow cytometry;protein expression;Perfluorooctanesulfonate;concentration response;interleukin 6;Mus;rodent;interleukin 1beta;macrophage;Macrophages;Spleen;inflammation;Pathology;tumor necrosis factor alpha;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha;Interleukin-6;Glycoproteins;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;Inbred C57BL;Inflammation;spleen;lipopolysaccharide;male behavior;cytokine response;CD11b antigen;Interleukin 1 β;Interleukin 6;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1beta;Lipopolysaccharide;Lipopolysaccharides;oncogene c myc;Peritoneal;peritoneum lavage;peritoneum macrophage;polysaccharide;splenic macrophage;Tumor necrosis factor α;Tumor necrosis factors,NA,NA

There is an urgent need for strategies to monitor and analyze the coexistence of PFASs and PCNs, especially in food samples at trace levels, to ensure food safety. Herein, a novel β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) derived fluoro-functionalized covalent triazine-based frameworks named CD-F-CTF was firstly synthesized. This innovative framework effectively combines the porous nature of the covalent organic framework and the host-guest recognition property of β-CD enabling the simultaneous extraction of PFASs and PCNs. Under the optimal conditions, a simple and rapid method was developed to analyze PFASs and PCNs by solid-phase extraction (SPE) based simultaneous extraction and stepwise elution (SESE) strategy for the first time. When coupled with liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC−MS/MS) and gas chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (GC−MS/MS), this method achieved impressive detection limits for PFASs (0.020 −0.023 ng/g) and PCNs (0.016 −0.075 ng/g). Furthermore, the excellent performance was validated in food samples with recoveries of 76.7–107 % (for PFASs) and 78.0–108 % (for PCNs).

The seals had higher total burdens (757.8 ng g-1 ww) than the dolphins (439.9 ng g-1 ww) and the porpoises (355.8 ng g-1 ww), probably a reflection of feeding closer to the shore and thus contamination sources.

In combination with the values obtained from the literature, this result indicates that Carnivora species including Pinnipedia have a much higher capacity of transforming PFOSA to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) than cetacean species. Another notable difference among the species was that the two smaller species (seals and porpoises) with supposedly higher metabolic rates had lower concentrations of the perfluorinated carboxylic acids, which are generally more easily excreted than perfluorinated sulfonamides. Species-specific characteristics should be recognized when PFAS contamination in marine mammals is investigated, for example, several previous studies of PFASs in cetaceans have not quantified PFOSA. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,10.1007/s11356-013-1633-x,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Sulfonamides;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;predator;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;article;North Sea;metabolism;organofluorine;biotransformation;Metabolism;sulfonamide;organic compound;Mammalia;Atlantic Ocean;perfluorooctanesulfonamide;Phoca;Phoca vitulina;pinniped;Pinnipedia;Seals;marine pollution;Water Pollutants;Cetacea;Carnivora;Chemical;Denmark;Earless;dolphin;Dolphins;porpoise;Phocoena phocoena;Phocoenidae;Perfluorinated alkylated substances;Harbor porpoise;Harbor seal;interspecific variation;Lagenorhynchus;Lagenorhynchus albirostris;Phocoena;White-beaked dolphin;Prednisolone,NA,NA

Samples were collected during dry (January) and wet (June) seasons, 2019. The perfluorinated compounds were cleaned up by solid phase extraction and analysed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry with stable isotopic labelled internal standards (13C8–PFOS and 13C8–PFOA). This study reports concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in seafood at levels between 29–6724 and <48–421 ng/kg wet weight, respectively. Surface water samples from rivers and the coastal sea had PFOS and PFOA between 0.60–465.65 and <0.25–59.29 ng/L, respectively. Contamination of PFOS and PFOA in bottled drinking water (<0.125–0.454 and <0.25–0.621 ng/L, respectively) did not exceed the USEPA standard of 70 ng/L. Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in seafood and water samples between seasons did not show any definite trend. Seafood dietary assessments of PFOS exposure in the seafood eater population raised a health concern, as the exposure exceeded the latest EFSA tolerable weekly intake value for PFAS mixtures (4.4 ng/kg body weight/week). Therefore, environmental and food samples from Map Ta Phut area should be closely monitored to ensure the safety of people living in and around this area. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,10.1080/19440049.2021.1921281,PFOS;Surface waters;Article;Thailand;concentration (parameter);nonhuman;dietary intake;food contamination;perfluoro compound;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;Phase separation;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;Meats;solid phase extraction;Perfluorinated compounds;human;river water;sea water;Solid-phase extraction;water sampling;dietary exposure;Tolerable weekly intakes;body weight;drinking water;Potable water;food safety;water contamination;seashore;stable isotope labeling;health hazard;limit of quantitation;Tandem mass spectrometry;PFOA;triple quadrupole mass spectrometry;Ultra performance liquid chromatography;certified reference material;coastal waters;fishery;carbon 13;sea food;Perfluorooctanesulphonate;seasonal variation;squid;fresh water;tap water;seafood;oyster;dry season;surface water;long term exposure;nutritional assessment;mussel;rainy season;cuttlefish;river ecosystem;Bottled drinking waters;cockle;food standard;Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate;Penaeus vannamei;shellfish farming;Tantalum,NA,NA

Previous studies have filtered water samples to remove suspended solids before PFAS analysis. However, filtration may introduce negative bias to measured PFAS concentrations. Using a well-controlled syringe pump assembly, we evaluated retention of six perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, three perfluoroalkyl sulfonates, one fluorotelomer sulfonate, and two perfluorooctane sulfonamides by glass-fiber, glass-fiber cellulose acetate, nylon, polyethersulfone, polypropylene, polyvinylidene fluoride/ difluoride, and surfactant-free cellulose acetate filters. The impacts of water quality and operational parameters were also investigated for select filter types. We found that PFAS were retained on all filters, with the glass-fiber cellulose acetate filters demonstrating the lowest retention. For all filters, PFAS retention was linearly related to chain length and hydrophobicity above certain thresholds (i.e., log D higher than 1.5). Importantly, more PFAS were retained at low filtrate volumes, and 30 mL filtrate was required before the retention efficiencies stabilized. Solution pH only affected the retention of perfluorooctane sulfonamides. Pore size (i.e., 0.20, 0.45, 0.70 µm), filtration rate (i.e., 0.5, 1.0 mL min−1), and PFAS concentration (i.e., 10, 100 µg L−1), did not exert major influences on PFAS retention. The presence of dissolved organic matter improved PFAS permeation.

Among them, microplastics (MPs; <5 mm) are ingested by aquatic organisms leading to negative effects on animal welfare. The interactions between MPs, contaminants and organisms are poorly understood. To clarify this issue, European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) were fed with diets supplemented with 0 (control), polyethylene (PE) MPs (100 mg/kg diet), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS, 4.83 μg/kg diet) or PFOS adsorbed to MPs (MPs-PFOS; final concentrations of 4.83 μg and 100 mg of PFOS and MP per kg of feed, respectively). Samples of skin mucus, serum, head-kidney (HK), liver, muscle, brain and intestine were obtained. PFOS levels were high in the liver of fish fed with the PFOS-diet, and markedly reduced when adsorbed to MPs. Compared to the control groups, liver EROD activity did not show any significant changes, whereas brain and muscle cholinesterase activities were decreased in all the groups. The histological and morphometrical study on liver and intestine showed significant alterations in fish fed with the experimental diets. At functional level, all the experimental diets affected the humoral (peroxidase, IgM, protease and bactericidal activities) as well as cellular (phagocytosis, respiratory burst and peroxidase) activities of HK leukocytes, being more marked those effects caused by the PFOS diet. Besides, treatments produced inflammation and oxidative stress as evidenced at gene level. Principal component analysis demonstrated that seabass fed with MPs-PFOS showed more similar effects to MPs alone than to PFOS. Overall, seabass fed with MPs-PFOS diet showed similar or lower toxicological alterations than those fed with MPs or PFOS alone demonstrating the lack of additive effects or even protection against PFOS toxicity. © 2023 The Author(s)",NA,10.1016/j.fsi.2023.108793,PFOS;Animals;Article;animal;concentration (parameter);nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;oxidative stress;genetics;brain;muscle;liver;serum;phagocytosis;intestine;plastic;Plastics;Immunity;enzyme activity;ethoxyresorufin deethylase;leukocyte;respiratory burst;Microplastics;immunotoxicity;microplastic;histopathology;diet supplementation;skin;humoral immunity;Oxidative stress;Water Pollutants;immunoglobulin M;inflammation;cellular immunity;Chemical;polyethylene;Polyethylene;bass;Bass;peroxidase;bactericidal activity;cholinesterase;European sea bass;European seabass;gene expression level;head kidney;immunological parameters;mucus;Peroxidases;proteinase;Vibrio anguillarum;Polyethylenes,NA,NA

In the present study, we have employed an ex vivo organ culture technique, based on the floating agarose method, of Atlantic cod ovarian tissue to investigate the effects of three different concentrations of PFOS, PFOA (1, 5 and 25 μM) and PFNA (0.5, 5 and 50 μM), used singly and in also in combination (1×, 20× and 100×). In the 1× exposure mixture, concentrations were decided based on their proportional levels (in molar equivalents) relative to PFOS, which is the most abundant PFAS in cod liver from a 2013 screening project. To investigate the detailed underlying mechanisms and biological processes, transcriptome sequencing was performed on exposed ovarian tissue. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) having at least 0.75 log2-fold change was elevated in high, compared to low and medium concentration exposures. The highest PFNA, PFOA and PFOS concentrations, and the highest (100×) mixture exposure, showed 40, 68, 1295, and 802 DEGs, respectively. The latter two exposure groups shared a maximum of 438 DEGs. In addition, they both shared the majority of functionally enriched pathways belonging to biological processes such as cellular signaling, cell adhesion, lipid metabolism, immunological responses, cancer, reproduction and metabolism. Shortlisted DEGs that were specifically annotated to reproduction associated gene ontology (GO) terms were observed only in the highest PFOS and mixture exposure groups. These transcripts contributed to ovarian key events such as steroidogenesis (star, cyp19a1a), oocyte growth (amh), maturation (igfbp5b, tgfβ2, tgfβ3), and ovulation (pgr, mmp2). Contrary to other PFAS congeners, the highest PFOS concentration showed almost similar transcript expression patterns compared to the highest mixture exposure group. This indicates that PFOS is the active component of the mixture that significantly altered the normal functioning of female gonads, and possibly leading to serious reproductive consequences in teleosts. © 2020 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142904,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFASs;immune response;Animals;Article;Liver;Transcriptome;Genes;animal;Cell proliferation;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;Mixtures;controlled study;bioaccumulation;animal tissue;chemical substance;lipid metabolism;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;gene;gene expression;genetics;quantitative analysis;Tissue;liver;human;priority journal;Environmental health;perfluorononanoic acid;metabolism;signal transduction;Contaminants;physiology;Metabolism;physiological response;juvenile animal;Differentially expressed gene;Immunological response;transcriptomics;transcriptome;malignant neoplasm;steroidogenesis;Cell adhesion;oocyte development;Lipid metabolisms;teleost;cell adhesion;oocyte maturation;reproductive health;Teleostei;Cell signaling;Atlantic cod;Gadus morhua;gene ontology;functions;ex vivo study;amh gene;Biological Phenomena;Biological process;cellular;cyp19a1a gene;Ex vivo;Expression patterns;Global consumption;igfbp5b gene;mmp2 gene;Molar concentration;molecular biological phenomena;Organ culture techniques;ovary tissue;pgr gene;RNA-seq;star gene;subcellular;tgfB2 gene;tgfB3 gene,NA,NA

The robustness of the protocol has been established by checking the accuracy of Si and Mg isotopic values in seven USGS rock reference materials. All isotopic analyses have been carried out in the interference free plateau of pseudo high-resolution mode of a Thermo Neptune MC-ICPMS to resolve Si-30 and Mg-26 peaks from their (NO)-N-14-O-16 and (CN+)-C-12-N-14 interferences respectively. The total variation of delta Si-30 among all terrestrial rock samples analyzed in this study lies in a limited range from - 0.28& to - 0.21%.

However, there are also many documented incidents of accidental releases. To track such releases, it is essential to distinguish between typical background contamination and legally relevant incidents. This requires a comprehensive overview of all PFAS present in the environment, which is currently only possible to a limited extent due to the large variety of individual compounds. In the present study, a multimethod for capturing 41 PFAS including perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors is introduced. The applicability of the method was tested on terrestrial, freshwater and marine samples from the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB), thereby providing a rough overview of PFAS contamination in German environment. Special focus was put on soil samples from ESB sites across Germany in comparison to soil samples from a polluted site in south-west Germany. The method was successfully applied to environmental samples. In total, 31 PFAS were detected, among them PFAA precursors and fluorinated ethers. Substance patterns differed between sites and matrices. In ESB soil samples from 2014 (n = 11), the sum of all captured PFAS ranged between 0.75 and 19.5 μg kg−1 dry weight (dw), while concentrations between 416 μg kg−1 and 3530 μg kg−1 were detected in samples from the incident site (n = 10). In other matrices, total PFAS concentrations were magnitudes lower. Highest concentrations were observed for PFOS in bream livers from the Saale (226 μg kg−1). Given the heterogeneous patterns, it will require further broadly-based monitoring data to allow for a solid estimation of relevant background levels.

We found that great and lesser black-backed gulls from South Western France are exposed to PFAS levels comparable to highly contaminated species from other geographical areas, although major emission sources (i.e. related to industrial activities) are absent in the region. We additionally found that PFAS are negatively associated with the body condition of the birds in two of the studied species, and that these results are sex-dependent. Finally, we found positive associations between exposure to PFAS and TT3 in the great black-backed gull, suggesting a potential disrupting mechanism of PFAS exposure.

Here, we investigated the estrogenic/antiestrogenic activities of PFASs and explored the corresponding interaction mode of PFASs with the estrogen receptor (ER) by combining in vitro assays and in silico modeling. We found that three PFASs (perfluorobutanoic acid, perfluorobutane sulfonate, and perfluoropentanoic acid) exerted antiestrogenic effects by inhibiting luciferase activity, whereas perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exerted estrogenic effects by inducing luciferase activity. When coexposed to 17β-estradiol (E2), all tested PFASs attenuated the E2-stimulated luciferase activity; unexpectedly, each PFAS could further attenuate the luciferase activity generated by the cotreatment with ICI 182,780 and E2, with a minimal effective concentration comparable to that found in human serum. PFHxS and PFOS significantly induced the gene expression of TFF1; additionally, all PFASs inhibited the E2-induced gene expression of TFF1 and EGR3. Furthermore, the results of the blind docking analyses suggested that the interaction with the coactivator-binding region on the ER surface should be included as a pathway through which PFASs exert estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities.

Samples were collected from each chamber at 3, 6, and 24 h postincubation for analysis using MS.Results: After injection into the anterior chamber, the concentration of all acylcarnitines increased in the vitreous chamber over the observation period. After injection in the vitreous chamber, the acylcarnitines diffused to the anterior chamber with the highest concentration observed at 3 h postinjection, followed by a decrease in concentration possibly due to an elimination from the anterior chamber despite continued diffusion from the vitreous chamber. C16, the most hydrophobic and longest chain molecule, showed slower diffusion in both experimental settings.Conclusion: We hereby show a distinct diffusion pattern of molecules with different molecular size and hydrophobicity within and between the anterior and vitreous chamber. This model can be useful for optimizing choices and design of therapeutic molecules with higher retaining or depot properties into the two chambers of the eye for future intravitreal, intracameral, and topical treatment purposes.",NA,10.1089/jop.2022.0159,Swine,NA,NA

Electrochemical oxidation of chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B, ClCF2CF2CF2CF2CF2CF2-O-CF2CF2-SO3K) as PFOS substitute was carried out with the BDD, BDD/SnO2, BDD/PbO2, and BDD/SnO2-F anodes. The effects of F and Sn ratio, current density, initial pH, initial F-53B concentration, the supporting electrolyte, NaCl concentration, and electrode distance on the degradation ratios were investigated. The defluorination and the desulfurization were evaluated by ion chromatography and UV–vis spectra. The intermediate products were analyzed on the liquid chromatography system coupled with a triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The experimental results showed that BDD/SnO2-F had the most outstanding electrochemical oxidation performance. After introduction of F into SnO2 crystal, the grain size of SnO2-F was reduced, the oxygen evolution potential was increased by 0.13 V, and the degradation ratio of F-53B was increased by 15.07%. Under the optimum operating parameters, F-53B removal ratio of 95.6% was obtained, and the defluorination ratio reached 61.39% with NaCl supporting electrolyte concentration of 1 mol/L at current density of 30 mA/cm2 after electrolysis of 30 min. Finally, the electrochemical degradation pathways and the mechanisms of F-53B were proposed based on the intermediate products and the previous literature reported.

Results show that over 99% PFOA can be removed by BC-ZVI in hydrothermal conditions under 240 °C within 6 h. The maximum defluorination rate of 63.2% was achieved after 192 h, and this outcome was significantly better than biochar (BC) and zero-valent iron (ZVI) alone. The short-chain perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and perfluoroheptanal were detected in the liquid phase after degradation, suggesting that the degradation of PFOAs by BC-ZVI followed the Kobel decarboxylation process. XRD and SEM-EDS analyses strongly suggested that carbothermal reduction could avoid the agglomeration of ZVI loaded onto biochar, which helped make the PFOA degradation more efficient. The frontier molecular orbital theory calculated by density functional theory revealed there were two possibilities for ZVI loading on BC (edged or internal loading), while the edge loaded ZVI had a greater tendency to provide electrons for the defluorination of PFOA than internally loaded ZVI. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150326,Fluorocarbons;Article;Carboxylation;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;carbon;controlled study;computer simulation;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;chemical compound;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;adsorption;octanoic acid;Caprylates;PFOA;experimental study;degradation;waste component removal;scanning electron microscopy;kinetics;Shorter chains;iron;X ray diffraction;Water Pollutants;chemical modification;physical phenomena;Chemical;Iron;hydrolysis;energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy;simulation;biochar;charcoal;density functional theory;Density functional theory;Charcoal;chemical procedures;defluorination;Defluorination;reaction time;agglomeration;Biochar;carbothermal reduction;decarboxylation;DFT calculation;frontier molecular orbital theory;hydrothermal condition;Hydrothermal conditions;Kobel decarboxylation;liquid phase;material state;Molecular orbitals;perfluoroheptanal;reaction temperature;Reductive defluorination;Simulation studies;theory;Zero-valent iron;Zero-valent iron-laden biochar;Oxalic Acid;Norisoprenoids,NA,NA

Plasma from 14 green turtles severely afflicted with fibropapillomatosis, and eggs from 12 Hawaiian hawksbill nests from 7 females were analyzed. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) predominated in green turtle plasma; perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) predominated in hawksbill tissues.

Green turtle plasma PFOS concentrations were related to human populations from highest to lowest: Hawai'i, Marianas, Palmyra. Influence on fibropapillomatosis was not evident. PFASs were maternally transferred to hawksbill eggs, with decreasing concentrations with distance from airports and with clutch order from one female.

Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are new pollutants that have received high attention in recent years, as they are not only harmful to human health, but also important contributors to climate change. Therefore, PFCs are the key gases for the coordinated governance of air pollution and climate change. With the geographical shift of fluoropolymer production, the main emitters of perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts (PFOA/PFO) moved from North America, Europe and Japan to emerging Asian economies, especially China. In this study, industrial sources of PFOA/PFO in the Chinese atmosphere were identified, and its atmospheric emissions, carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions and environmental risks were assessed. China released about 38.19 tons PFOA/PFO into the atmosphere through industrial activities in 2019, 97 % of which originated from the production of fluoropolymers. PFOA/PFO showed aggregative emission along the eastern coastal zone, especially in the Yangtze River Delta. Cumulative PFOA/PFO emission from all provinces equaled to 0.28–0.47 million tons CO2e, of which Jiangsu and Zhejiang took the lead, while Shanghai's CO2-equivalent emissions intensity of PFOA/PFO in terms of area, population, gross domestic product (GDP), and industrial added value took the first in China. The available monitoring data on atmospheric concentration of PFOA in urban and rural China implied that its distribution pattern was similar to PFOA/PFO emissions, that is, the concentrations in the eastern regions with the highest degree of industrialization were significantly higher than that in the central and western regions, and the PFOA concentrations in urban China were higher than that in the rural, which proved that industrial use was an important source of PFOA pollution and would cause significant risks to the environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161507,Article;China;climate change;Climate change;unclassified drug;geographic distribution;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;Perfluorinated compounds;urban pollution;air pollution;sensitivity analysis;Risk perception;Yangtze Delta;solid waste management;polymer;industrialization;environmental risk;coastal zone;Fluorine containing polymers;Carbon dioxide;carbon dioxide;Air pollution;Industrial emissions;Environmental risks;industrial emission;Jiangsu;Zhejiang;carbon emission;Salts;Shanghai;greenhouse gas;Atmospheric emission;carbon dioxide equivalent;Carbon dioxide equivalent;Environmental risk;Fluoropolymer;Greenhouse gases;Industrial processs;Industrial source;Industrial sources;Perfluorooctanoic acid/PFO;PFOA/PFO;polyvinylidene fluoride;Process emissions;source identification;Urban chinas;Carbon Dioxide,NA,NA

These particles can absorb other chemicals and microbial contaminants and release them into the environment and food chain. Despite the high efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in removing MPs, WWTPs are still one of the major sources of MPs discharge to the environment. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of MPs removal in a municipal WWTP with conventional activated sludge in Iran.Methods: MPs particles were counted using a stereomicroscope after the initial preparation steps (sieving, chemical digestion with the catalytic wet peroxidation-oxidation and density separation with NaCl) and then analyzed for particle composition using a Raman micro-spectrometer.Results: MPs concentration in the influent, grit chamber, primary sedimentation tank, and effluent were 843.2 +/- 147.5, 315.5 +/- 54.7, 80.2 +/- 19.1, and 11.13 +/- 3.14 items/L, respectively. The overall MPs removal efficiency of the WWTP was 98.7%, with the grit chamber, primary sedimentation tank, and secondary sedimentation tank removed 62.6%, 27.9%, and 8.2% of the total MPs, respectively. The most abundant polymers were polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE).Conclusion: Despite the effective removal of MPs in WWTP, on average 4.47 x 1011 +/- 1.03 x 1011 MPs are discharged into the receiving waters through the effluent of this WWTP annually.

Therefore, PFAAs concentrations in fish from the North Atlantic (Icelandic fishing grounds) in the flesh of different fish species were investigated along with more detailed analyses of tissue concentrations in cod (Gadus morhua) and lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus). Further, fish feed was investigated as a possible source of PFAAs in aquaculture by examining fish meal as feed ingredient. No PFAAs were detected in the edible part of all fish samples, except for PFOS in pollock (Pollachius virens, 0,05 ng/g wet weight). PFOS was the only PFAA detected in the fish meal samples with the exception of PFOSA in blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) meal (0,45 ng/g dry weight (d.w.)), where the PFOS concentration was 1,3-13 ng/g d.w. in the capelin (Mallotus villosus) and mackerel (Scomber scombrus) meal samples. The conclusions of the study are that fish commonly consumed from the Icelandic fishing grounds are unlikely to be an important source of PFAAs exposure. © 2014 Hrönn Jörundsdóttir et al.",NA,10.1155/2014/573607,Fluorocarbons;exposure;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Chromatography;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;environmental monitoring;animal tissue;water pollutant;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;article;organofluorine derivative;priority journal;metabolism;limit of detection;fishery;Fishes;sea food;Seafood;dry weight;aquaculture;Water Pollutants;Iceland;Chemical;Liquid;Atlantic cod;Cyclopterus lumpus;Fish Products;perfluorinatedalkyl acid;Pollachius virens,NA,NA

At the shore, ultraviolet (UV) radiation (also present in other environmental compartments) and wave breaking cause plastics to degrade and fragment into smaller particles, called microplastics, if below 5 mm. Since these plastics’ surfaces can act as vectors for hydrophobic (toxic) chemical substances (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)) and leach (toxic) chemicals into the water, the increase in the surface area through the fragmentation of plastics becomes relevant. Studies investigating different effects on the fragmentation of plastics have mostly disregarded a sufficient mechanical component for fragmentation, focusing on degradation by UV radiation. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the mechanical fragmentation drivers, wave impact, and sediment abrasion on the fragmentation of expanded polystyrene (EPS), high-density polyethylene (PE-HD), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particles. In a newly designed test facility called Slosh-Box, the mentioned impacts were investigated concurrently. The results reveal that the mechanical impacts alone are sufficient for plastic fragmentation, and the test facility is suitable for fragmentation investigations. Furthermore, the increase in surface area was determined via scanning electron microscopy. For EPS, the surface area increased more than 2370-fold, while for PE-HD and PET, surface areas increased between 1 and 8.6 times. Concluding from the results, the new test facility is suitable for plastic fragmentation studies. In addition, sediment was revealed to be a relevant fragmentation driver, which should be included in every experiment investigating the fragmentation of plastic in a nearshore environment independent of other drivers like UV radiation. © 2023 The Authors.

The total concentrations of PFAAs (∑PFAAs) ranged from 1.30 to 913 ng/g on a dry weight basis (dw), 31.4–15656 ng/L, and 11.8–59.7 ng/L in soil, groundwater and tap water samples respectively. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were the predominant PFAAs in the soil whereas PFBA was the predominant congener in groundwater. PFAA concentrations in the soil and groundwater decreased with increasing distance from the manufactory. Shorter-chain PFAAs showed higher proportions in groundwater than in soil samples and that shorter-chain PFAAs exhibited faster decreasing rates in soil samples, which may be due to the differences in the polarity and hydrophobicity of these molecules. For isomer profiles, n-PFHxS, n-PFOS, and n-PFOA were the main isomer in soil samples and groundwater samples.

Gender (0.43 < p < 0.97) and age (0.15 < p < 0.95) were not significantly related to any of the organohalogen groups. Body condition showed a significant inverse relationship with Sigma PBDE, Sigma Chlordane and HCB, suggesting that increased tissue contaminant concentrations are associated with depletion of adipose tissue. The seasonal cyclic storage and mobilisation of adipose tissue, characteristic in Arctic wildlife, may then provide increased input of contaminants to sensitive, vital effect organs. Trophic position was estimated by delta N-15 from muscle samples and showed significantly positive relationship with all contaminants, with the exception of HCB concentrations. This indicates that foxes feeding at high trophic levels had higher tissue contaminant levels as a result of bioaccumulation in the food chain. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of previous risk assessment without considering the PFOS isomer profile and the toxicity of individual PFOS isomers, here we performed a new health risk assessment of PFOS for thyroid hormonal perturbation in drinking water with the contribution from individual PFOS isomers. The risk quotients (RQs) of individual PFOS isomers indicated that linear PFOS contributed most to the risk among all the target PFOS isomers (83.0%-90.2% of the total PFOS RQ), and that risk from 6m-PFOS (5.2%-11.9% of the total PFOS RQ) was higher than that from other branched PFOS isomers. We found that the risks associated with PFOS in drinking water would be overestimated by 10.0%-91.7% if contributions from individual PFOS isomers were not considered.

It has been observed that river loads increased during rain and that street runoff contained considerable loads of PFAAs. This study aims at quantifying these diffuse inputs and identifying the initial sources in a small nonindustrial river catchment. The river was sampled in three distinct subcatchments (rural, urban, and wastewater treatment plant) at high temporal resolution during two rain events and samples were analyzed for perfluorocarboxylates and perfluorosulfonates. Additionally, rain, stormwater runoff, wastewater effluent, and drinking water were sampled. PFAA concentrations in river water were all low (e.g., < 10 ng/L for perfluorooctanoate, PFOA), but increased during rainfall. PFAA concentrations and water discharge data were integrated into a mass balance assessment that shows that 30-60% of PFAA loads can be attributed to diffuse inputs. Rain contributed 10-50% of the overall loads, mobilization of dry deposition and outdoor release of PFAA from products with 20-60%.

Recently, a limited number of PFOS studies have raised concerns about its potential immune system effects. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the immunotoxicity of PFOS remains unknown. In this study, we used primary human lymphocytes as a model, together with integrative omics analyses, including the transcriptome and lipidome, and bioinformatics analysis, to resolve the immune toxicity effects of PFOS. Our results demonstrated that PFOS could alter the production of interleukins in human lymphocytes. Additionally, PFOS exposure could dysregulate clusters of genes and lipids that play important roles in immune functions, such as lymphocyte differentiation, inflammatory response, and immune response.

However, the toxicity effects of emerging ionizable POPs mediated by differentially charged engineered nanoparticles on aquatic insects are unknown. In this study, 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (F-53B, an emerging perfluoroalkyl acid alternative) was selected as a model emerging ionizable POP; the effect of differentially charged nanoplastics (NPs, 50 nm, 0.5 g/kg) on F-53B bioaccumulation and gut toxicity to Chironomus kiinensis were investigated through histopathology, biochemical index, and gut microbiota analysis. The results showed that when the dissolved concentration of F-53B remained constant, the presence of NPs enhanced the adverse effects on larval growth, emergence, gut oxidative stress and inflammation induced by F-53B, and the enhancement caused by positively charged NP-associated F-53B was stronger than that caused by the negatively charged one. This was mainly because positively charged NPs, due to their greater adsorption capacity and higher bioavailable fraction of associated F-53B, increased the bioaccumulation of F-53B in larvae more significantly than negatively charged NPs. In addition, positively charged NPs interact more easily with gut biomembranes and microbes with a negative charge, further increasing the probability of F-53B interacting with gut biomembranes and microbiota and thereby aggravating gut damage and key microbial dysbacteriosis related to gut health.

However, there have been limited investigations on the vertical distribution of PFAS in fluorine (F) contaminated soils. In this study, the spatial and vertical distribution of metals, total F, and PFAS in the soil profiles were investigated at different areas in an industrial city. The higher F concentrations in the farmland soils with intensive agricultural activities suggested the impacts of soil tillage. The ΣPFAS concentrations ranged from 0.187 to 1.852 ng g−1 in all soil samples, with PFOA as the dominant pollutant, which accounted for 17.2%–51.6% of the ΣPFAS in all samples. Highest level of PFAS was found in the shallow layer of the soil profiles. The long-chain PFAS such as PFUdA and PFTeDA tended to remain in the topsoil, while the short-chains (PFBA, PFPeA, and PFHxA) have migrated to depth of 100 cm in the vertical soil profile. The application of F-enriched phosphorus fertilizers and atmospheric deposition may be important sources of F and PFAS in soils in this area. Correlation analysis indicated that most of PFAS have similar common sources, and the significantly positive correlation between Zn and PFAS suggested they may share similar sources.

Because of the regulations on perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), its use is expected to increase. Until now, F-53B toxicity data have been scarce and are, to our knowledge, lacking for birds. This study therefore investigated the effects of PFOS and F-53B, separately and as mixtures, on the development of the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). Compounds were injected in ovo, before incubation, at 150 and 1500 ng/g egg. At embryonic day 20, a significantly lower heart rate was observed in all treated groups compared to the control group and hatchlings exposed to the high dose of F-53B had a significantly enlarged liver (8%). Embryonic survival was not affected and no significant effects on hatchling body mass or oxidative stress parameters were found. Our results suggest that these compounds likely have different toxicity thresholds for the investigated endpoints, and/or different modes of action. This study thereby underlines the potential developmental toxicity of PFOS and F-53B at environmentally relevant concentrations. Assessment of PFOS alternatives should therefore continue, preferably prior to their large scale use, as they should be ensured to be less harmful than PFOS itself. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.8b04749,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Chickens;Ether;Ethers;animal;body mass;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;bird;controlled study;chicken;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;chlorinated hydrocarbon;chlorination;pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;oxidative stress;sulfonate;sulfonic acid derivative;Toxicity;developmental toxicity;embryo;Gallus gallus;hatchling;ecotoxicology;zebra fish;Zebrafish;Aves;ether derivative;ether;Spondias purpurea;abnormality;Control groups;Developmental toxicity;Electroplating industry;Electroplating shops;embryonic development;Embryonic survival;heart rate;Heart rates;hepatomegaly;Stress parameter;Toxicity data;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Sulfones,NA,NA

Herein, we report the application of internal extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (iEESI-MS) to direct phospholipid profiling in the liver and spleen tissues of Nile tilapia exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Combining positive and negative ion detection modes, 130 phospholipid signals were directly detected and identified by iEESI-MS in the tissues of Nile tilapia, including phosphatidyl cholines (PCs), sphingomyelins (SMs), phosphatidic acids (PAs), phosphatidyl ethanolamines (PEs), phosphatidyl glycerols (PGs), phosphatidyl inositols (PIs) and phosphatidyl serines (PSs). With the help of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), several phospholipid signals showed a significant difference in the tissue of Nile tilapia between the control group and PFOA exposure groups. In addition, pathway analysis revealed that PFOA has a significant metabolic impact on the glycerophospholipid metabolism in Nile tilapia. Without complex sample preparation, iEESI-MS was applied to direct phospholipid profiling in the liver and spleen tissues of Nile tilapia treated with PFOA, which provided a promising methodology for investigating environmental toxicity and phospholipid-dysregulation caused by emerging pollutants in aquatic organisms. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA,10.1039/d2an00820c,"Fluorocarbons;Animals;Spectrometry;animal;fluorocarbon;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;Histology;Mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;Emerging pollutants;procedures;Tissue;Toxicity;Exposed to;octanoic acid;electrospray mass spectrometry;Electrospray ionization;Caprylates;Metabolism;Phospholipids;Least squares approximations;Amino acids;Negative ions;Liver tissue;Tissue samples;Amines;Electrospray Ionization;Mass;cichlid;Cichlids;Discriminant analysis;Analysis of variance (ANOVA);Direct profiling;Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry;Ion detection;Nile tilapia;phosphatidic acid;Phosphatidic Acids;Spleen tissues;Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization;Mass Spectrometry",NA,NA

Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) have been advocated as an environmental sentinel for contaminants due to their longevity, site fidelity and prey species that often overlap with human consumption. Using archived (1992–2010) samples of livers from Northern sea otters (n = 50) from Alaska we examine concentrations of chlordanes (CHLs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and associated metabolites. We found some evidence for declining ΣPCBs over the two decades, however for most animals concentrations were low compared to toxicological thresholds. Six animals had relatively high concentrations of ΣPCBs (mean = 262,000 ng/g lipid weight), ΣDDTs (mean = 8,800 ng/g lw), and ΣPBDEs (mean = 4,600 ng/g lw), with four of these six animals experiencing hepatic parasitism or hepatitis. In order to assess whether differences in POP concentrations are associated with feeding ecology, we examined stable isotopes of C and N in archived muscle and whisker samples. In general, there were no significant relationships between ΣPOP concentrations and stable isotope ratios. There were small differences in stable isotope profiles in animals with high POP concentrations, although it was unclear if these differences were due to feeding ecology or disease processes. This study highlights the importance of considering feeding ecology and necropsy (health and disease status) data while conducting contaminant surveys, and confirms some previous reports of trends in OHCs in Alaska marine mammals.

Therefore, we characterized the tissue distribution of 14C-PFOA in mice in the same manner as we earlier examined its analogues perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS) in order to allow direct comparisons. Following dietary exposure of adult male C57/BL6 mice for 1, 3 or 5 days to a low dose (0.06 mg/kg/day) or a higher experimental dose (22 mg/kg/day) of 14C-PFOA, both scintillation counting and whole-body autoradiography revealed the presence of PFOA in most of the 19 different tissues examined, demonstrating its ability to leave the bloodstream and enter tissues. There were no differences in the pattern of tissue distribution with the low and high dose and the tissue-to-blood ratios were similar. At both doses, PFOA levels were highest in the liver, followed by blood, lungs and kidneys. The body compartments estimated to contain the largest amounts of PFOA were the liver, blood, skin and muscle. In comparison with our identical studies on PFOS and PFBS, PFOA reached considerably higher tissue levels than PFBS, but lower than PFOS.

The source of CDFA was postulated to be photodegradation of CFC-113, and to a lesser extent HCFC-142b. Alkalized annular denuders were used for collection of gaseous and particle phase HAAs in ambient air. Trifluoro- (TFA), monochloro- (MCA), dichloro- (DCA), and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) were the dominant HAAs in air, at mean concentrations of 0.76, 3.4, 1.3, and 0.14 ng m-3, respectively.

OHCs have been of concern in the circumpolar arctic for decades. For example, as a consequence of bioaccumulation and in some cases biomagnification of legacy (e.g., chlorinated PCBs, DDTs and CHLs) and emerging (e.g., brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and in particular polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA) found in Arctic biota and humans. Of high concern are the potential biological effects of these contaminants in exposed Arctic wildlife and fish. As concluded in the last review in 2004 for the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) on the effects of POPs in Arctic wildlife, prior to 1997, biological effects data were minimal and insufficient at any level of biological organization. The present review summarizes recent studies on biological effects in relation to OHC exposure, and attempts to assess known tissue/body compartment concentration data in the context of possible threshold levels of effects to evaluate the risks. This review concentrates mainly on post-2002, new OHC effects data in Arctic wildlife and fish, and is largely based on recently available effects data for populations of several top trophic level species, including seabirds (e.g., glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus)), polar bears (Ursus maritimus), polar (Arctic) fox (Vulpes lagopus), and Arctic chart (Salvelinus alpinus), as well as semi-captive studies on sled dogs (Canis familiaris). Regardless, there remains a dearth of data on true contaminant exposure, cause-effect relationships with respect to these contaminant exposures in Arctic wildlife and fish. Indications of exposure effects are largely based on correlations between biomarker endpoints (e.g., biochemical processes related to the immune and endocrine system, pathological changes in tissues and reproduction and development) and tissue residue levels of OHCs (e.g., PCBs, DDTs, CHLs, PBDEs and in a few cases perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs)). Some exceptions include semi-field studies on comparative contaminant effects of control and exposed cohorts of captive Greenland sled dogs, and performance studies mimicking environmentally relevant PCB concentrations in Arctic charr. Recent tissue concentrations in several arctic marine mammal species and populations exceed a general threshold level of concern of 1 part-per-million (ppm), but a clear evidence of a POP/OHC-related stress in these populations remains to be confirmed. There remains minimal evidence that OHCs are having widespread effects on the health of Arctic organisms, with the possible exception of East Greenland and Svalbard polar bears and Svalbard glaucous gulls. However, the true (if any real) effects of POPs in Arctic wildlife have to be put into the context of other environmental, ecological and physiological stressors (both anthropogenic and natural) that render an overall complex picture. For instance, seasonal changes in food intake and corresponding cycles of fattening and emaciation seen in Arctic animals can modify contaminant tissue distribution and toxicokinetics (contaminant deposition, metabolism and depuration). Also, other factors, including impact of climate change (seasonal ice and temperatur changes, and connection to food web changes, nutrition, etc. in exposed biota), disease, species invasion and the connection to disease resistance will impact toxicant exposure. Overall, further research and better understanding of POP/OHC impact on animal performance in Arctic biota are recommended. Regardless, it could be argued that Arctic wildlife and fish at the highest potential risk of POP/OHC exposure and mediated effects are East Greenland, Svalbard and (West and South) Hudson Bay polar bears, Alaskan and Northern Norway killer whales, several species of gulls and other seabirds from the Svalbard area, Northern Norway, East Greenland, the Kara Sea and/or the Canadian central high Arctic, East Greenland ringed seal and a few populations of Arctic charr and Greenland shark.

Given the limited availability of chemical standards, capturing the total amount of PFAS is challenging. Thus, the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay has been developed to estimate the total amount of PFAS via the oxidative conversion of precursors into perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). This study aims to enhance the robustness of the TOP assay by replacing heat activation with UV activation. We evaluated the molar yields of known precursors in water in the presence of varying levels of Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) and in two soils. The impact of UV activation was also evaluated in two soils spiked with three well-characterized AFFFs, six AFFF-impacted field soils, and nine rinse samples of AFFF-impacted stainless-steel pipe. In the presence of 100 mg/L SNROM, 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (FTS), 8:2 FTS, and N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (N-EtFOSAA) in deionized water had good molar recovery as PFCAs (average of 102 ± 9.8 %); at 500 mg/L SNROM, the recovery significantly dropped to an average of 51 ± 19 %. In two soils (with 4 % and 8.8 % organic matter) with individual precursor spikes, the average molar recovery was 101 ± 9.4 %, except N-EtFOSAA, which had a reduced recovery in the soil with 8.8 % organic matter (OM). UV-activated assays outperformed heat-activated ones, especially in AFFF-impacted soils and pipe extract samples, with an average of 1.4–1.5× higher PFCA recovery. In almost all test samples, UV activation resulted in a notable shift towards longer PFCA chain lengths, particularly for samples with high OM content. The study confirmed the advantages of UV activation, including a significantly shortened exposure time (1 h vs. 6 h) and reduced matrix effects from OM due to the dual functions of UV in activating persulfate and photodegrading OM. © 2024 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171292,United States;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Degradation;organohalogen;organic matter;Aqueous film forming foams;Aqueous film-forming foam;foam;polyfluoroalkyl substance;Soil;soil pollution;Soils;Recovery;Perfluorocarboxylic acid;Organic compounds;Chemical activation;Aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF);Biogeochemistry;ultraviolet radiation;photodegradation;Per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS);Deionized water;Fluorotelomers;Photochemical degradation;photochemistry;Sulphonates;Suwannee River;Total oxidizable precursor assay;Total oxidizable precursor assay (TOP);UV activation,NA,NA

Although Lake Michigan and its basin were the primary focus of my research, my dissertation is broadly applicable to the Great Lakes watershed and aquatic ecosystems that face similar legacy and emerging contaminant threats. My dissertation demonstrated that contaminant accumulation and distribution within fish is influenced by a variety of ecological factors, including life history strategies, diet, habitat utilization, and size. By combining novel measurement techniques and modeling approaches, I identify important processes controlling the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of mercury, microplastics, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in Lake Michigan fish. First, I demonstrate that mercury bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in six Lake Michigan prey fish and show that differences are due to ontogeny, trophic position, and habitat. Next, I determine that microplastic concentrations and types present in Indiana waterways are influenced by atmospheric deposition rather than land-use. Then, I provide the first evidence of maternal transfer of PFAS to embryos in fish. I then evaluate the differences in PFAS concentration across all major fish tissue types to provide recommendations for tissue types that will enhance cross-study comparisons. I also determine that an iteroparous species (steelhead trout) had higher total body burdens of PFAS compared to semelparous species (Chinook and coho salmon), suggesting that repeat spawners have more opportunities for PFAS exposure and acquisition. Finally, I adapt and optimize a rapid method for measuring total fluorine as a proxy for PFAS using Particle-Induced Gamma-ray Emission (PIGE) spectroscopy, which will increase sample through-put and reduce cost for processing PFAS samples when compared to Liquid Chromatography with tandem Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS).

The uptake and elimination kinetics of PFOS and PFOA fit a one-compartment first-order kinetic model. PFOS displayed higher uptake and lower elimination rate coefficients, and longer time to reach steady-state (tss) than those of PFOA. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of PFOS and PFOA ranged 1.54-4.12 and 0.52-1.34gsoilgworm-1, respectively. The BAFs and tss decreased with increasing concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in soils. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to elucidate the bioavailability of PFOS and PFOA. The results showed that the total concentrations of PFOS and PFOA, and organic matter (OM) contents in soils explained 87.2% and 91.3% of the variation in bioavailable PFOS and PFOA, respectively. PFOS and PFOA concentrations exhibited positive influence and OM contents showed the negative influence on the accumulation of PFOS and PFOA in earthworms.

Differences in accumulation and effect result in differences of chemical risk to these species. However, little is known about the effect of contaminants in marine wildlife. Cell-based, or in vitro, exposure experiments offer an ethical alternative to investigate the effect of contaminants in wildlife. Data from in vitro studies can then be placed in an environmental context, by using screening risk assessments, comparing effect data with accumulation data from the literature, to identify risk to populations of marine wildlife. Cytotoxicity of Cr6+, Cd2+, Hg2+, 4,4’-DDE, and PFNA were investigated in primary skin fibroblasts of green turtles, loggerhead turtles, hawksbill turtles, dugongs, Burrunan dolphins, and common bottlenose dolphins. The general order of toxicity for all species was Hg2+> Cr6+ > Cd2+> 4,4′-DDE > PFNA, and significant differences in cytotoxicity were found between species for Cr6+, Cd2+ and PFNA. For Cd2+, in particular, cells from turtle species were less sensitive than mammalian species, and dugong cells were by far the most sensitive. The results from the cytotoxicity assay were then used in combination with published data on tissue contaminant concentrations to calculate risk quotients for identifying populations of each species most at risk from these chemicals. Cr, Cd and Hg were identified as posing risk in all six species. Dugongs were particularly at risk from Cd accumulation and dolphin species were particularly at risk from Hg accumulation. These results demonstrate the importance of using species-specific effect and accumulation data for developing chemical risk assessments and can be used to inform managers of priority contaminants, species, or populations. Development of additional in vitro endpoints, and improving links between in vitro and in vivo effects, would further improve this approach to understanding chemical risk in marine megafauna. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105939,chemical pollutant;Animals;Article;Risk Assessment;animal;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;water pollutant;pollution monitoring;pollution exposure;Tursiops;Tursiops truncatus;risk assessment;toxicity;cadmium;bioassay;mercury;mercury (element);Chelonia;Cheloniidae;Eretmochelys;Eretmochelys imbricata;perfluorononanoic acid;pollution effect;Testudines;turtle;Turtles;animal cell;species difference;Species Specificity;Mammalia;cytotoxicity assay;cell viability;cytotoxicity;cytology;skin;Cytotoxicity;EC50;chromium;marine ecosystem;Water Pollutants;Bioassay;Chemical;1;1 dichloro 2;2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene;dolphin;Dolphins;Dolphin;toothed whale;Caretta;Caretta caretta;Dugong;fauna;macrofauna;multiple chemical sensitivity;Primary cell culture;resazurin assay;sea turtle;Sea turtle;sirenian;Military Personnel,NA,NA

Substances identified by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) as of emerging concern for the marine environment have been used as a starting point. Results and conclusions The study presents data of 19 emerging flame retardants and degradation products, 40 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and three cyclic volatile methylsiloxanes (cVMS). Among the emerging flame retardants, only Dec 602 was detected in all samples of 2015. Dec 604, Cl-10-antiDP, 1,5-DPMA, EH-TBB, PBEB, TBP-AE, BATE, BTBPE and HBBz were constantly < limit of quantification (LOQ). Time trends were barely detected. Legacy PBDE still dominates in most samples. PFAS concentrations were usually higher in samples from the North Sea sites compared to samples from the Baltic Sea. PFOS dominated in most samples. Increasing trends over time were detected for PFNA, PFDA and PFDoDA at the Baltic Sea site and for PFDA at one North Sea site. Concentrations of the cVMS D4, D5 and D6 were below the detection limit at the ESB sampling sites.

However, it persists in the environment and is potentially toxic to organisms. Although China has been the main manufacturer and consumer for PFOS, the national pollution level and potential risk of this chemical are yet to be determined. This study aimed to provide an overview of PFOS contamination in surface and drinking water across China and to assess the potential ecological and health risks. Available monitoring data for PFOS in surface and drinking water were evaluated. PFOS was found to be ubiquitous in China, but the overall level of contamination was low compared with that in other countries. The southeast coastal area of China, with major PFOS-related companies, was characterized by relatively high PFOS exposure concentrations. The most sensitive effects was screened and applied to assess the ecological risk using the joint probability curve method. The probability of exceeding the growth and development toxicity for 5% of aquatic species was 0.65% in Chinese surface waters, while the highest probability of 0.90% was in Tai Lake in east China. Considering the average daily dose (ADD) for the Chinese population, the health risk posed by PFOS through drinking water ranged from 1.31 × 10−4 to 13.91. Besides the relatively high health risk existed in east China, most health risks in China were acceptable. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139914,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Surface waters;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;Risk Assessment;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;controlled study;ecotoxicity;environmental monitoring;Health risks;water pollutant;geographic distribution;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;pollution monitoring;alkanesulfonic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;sulfonate;developmental toxicity;human;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;drinking water;Exposure concentration;Potable water;priority journal;water contamination;pollution effect;endocrine disruptor;health hazard;lake;Drinking Water;health risk;River pollution;probability;endocrine disease;Health;Health risk;water resource;water supply;population research;seasonal variation;pollution incidence;aquatic species;coastal zone;surface water;Ecological risks;Water Pollutants;long term exposure;development;Chemical;Aquatic species;Ecological risk;Potential risks;Taihu Lake;Drinking water;Chinese;Growth;Joint probability curves;Pollution level;Sulfones;Drinking,NA,NA

This AOF method was further simplified to enable measurement of larger series of environmental samples. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.77 μg/L F. The modified protocol was applied to 22 samples from German rivers, a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and four groundwater samples from a fire-fighting training site.The WWTP effluent (AOF = 1.98 μg/L F) and only three river water samples (AOF between 0.88 μg/L F and 1.47 μg/L F) exceeded the LOQ.

Emissions to air were assessed at eight WWTPs using paired sorbent-impregnated polyurethane foam passive air samplers, deployed during summer 2013 and winter 2014. Samplers were deployed on-site above the active tank and off-site as a reference. Several types of WWTPs were investigated: secondary activated sludge in urban areas (UR-AS), secondary extended aeration in towns (TW-EA) and facultative lagoons in rural areas (RU-LG). The concentrations of target compounds in air were ∼1.7–35 times higher on-site compared to the corresponding off-site location. Highest concentrations in air were observed at UR-AS sites while the lowest were at RU-LG. Higher air concentrations (∼2–9 times) were observed on-site during summer compared to winter, possibly reflecting enhanced volatilization due to higher wastewater temperatures or differences in influent wastewater concentrations. A significant positive correlation was obtained between concentrations in air and WWTP characteristics (influent flow rate and population in the catchment of the WWTP); whereas a weak negative correlation was obtained with hydraulic retention time. Emissions to air were estimated using a simplified dispersion model. Highest emissions to air were seen at the UR-AS locations.

In the present study, we employed zebrafish embryos to investigate the developmental toxicity of this compound. Four-hour post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 mg/L PFOS. Hatching was delayed and hatching rates as well as larval survivorship were significantly reduced after the embryos were exposed to 1, 3 and 5 mg/L PFOS until 132 hpf. The fry displayed gross developmental malformations, including epiboly deformities, hypopigmentation, yolk sac edema, tail and heart malformations and spinal curvature upon exposure to PFOS concentrations of 1 mg/L or greater. Growth (body length) was significantly reduced in the 3 and 5 mg/L PFOS-treated groups. To test whether developmental malformation was mediated via apoptosis, flow cytometry analysis of DNA content, acridine orange staining and TUNEL assay was used. These techniques indicated that more apoptotic cells were present in the PFOS-treated embryos than in the control embryos. Certain genes related to cell apoptosis, p53 and Bax, were both significantly up-regulated upon exposure to all the concentrations tested. In addition, we investigated the effects of PFOS on marker genes related to early thyroid development (hhex and pax8) and genes regulating the balance of androgens and estrogens (cyp19a and cyp19b). For thyroid development, the expression of hhex was significantly up-regulated at all concentrations tested, whereas pax8 expression was significantly up-regulated only upon exposure to lower concentrations of PFOS (0.1, 0.5, 1 mg/L).

Exposure to PFOS has been associated with abnormal fetal development. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been showed to play a role in fetal growth restriction (FGR), preeclampsia (PE) and other pregnancy complications. Whether the lncRNA contributes to PFOS-induced toxicity in the placenta remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of lncRNA MEG3 and its derived miR-770 in PFOS-induced placental toxicity. Pregnant mice received gavage administration of different concentrations of PFOS (0.5, 2.5, and 12.5 mg/kg/day) from GD0 to GD17, and HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with PFOS in the concentrations of 0, 10−1, 1, 10 μM. We found that expression levels of miR-770 and its host gene MEG3 were reduced in mice placentas and HTR-8/SVneo cells with exposure of PFOS. A significant hypermethylation was observed at MEG3 promoter in placentas of mice gestational-treated with PFOS. We also confirmed that MEG3 and miR-770 overexpression alleviated the cell growth inhibition induced by PFOS. Furthermore, PTX3 (Pentraxin 3) was identified as the direct target of miR-770 and it was enhanced after PFOS exposure. In summary, our results suggested that MEG3 alleviate PFOS-induced placental cell inhibition through MEG3/miR-770/PTX3 axis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118542,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;RNA;Mice;Pregnancy;Placenta;animal;Cell proliferation;concentration (parameter);female;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;persistent organic pollutant;animal tissue;mouse;Mammals;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;gene;genetics;toxicity;Toxicity;Environmental pollutants;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;animal model;down regulation;microRNA;MicroRNAs;pregnancy;cell proliferation;placenta;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid;DNA methylation;promoter region;rodent;cell growth;Cell growth;Growth kinetics;gene overexpression;inhibition;pathogenesis;cell;fetus;Preeclampsia;growth inhibition;Growth inhibition;gene function;Fetal development;Fetal growth restriction;Gadolinium compounds;HTR-8/SVneo cell line;lncRNA MEG3;Long non-coding RNA MEG3;Long Noncoding;long untranslated RNA;MEG3 gene;microRNA 770;miR-770;Mir-770;pentraxin 3;Pentraxin 3;placental cell line;placental toxicity;PTX3;PTX3 gene,NA,NA

According to Article 7 of the SC, each party should develop a National Implementation Plan (NIP) and endeavour to implement the plan for the control and elimination of POPs. A first detailed National Implementation Plan has been developed for Kuwait with the support of the Stockholm Convention Regional Center for Capacity-Building and the Transfer of Technology for West Asia (SCRC Kuwait) in KISR. It includes a detailed action plan to manage and control the POPs in the country but also with activities to further give regional support for POPs monitoring and management. The current paper discusses the major inventory findings for the individual POPs groups including POPs pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) as well as Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and unintentional POPs. Besides, information from POPs monitoring studies in Kuwait relevant to the NIP is shortly compiled for further informing on the current situation of POPs in Kuwait. Selected soil samples were collected and analyzed for selected POPs during the NIP development to generate supplementary information to the POP monitoring studies already conducted in Kuwait. Further relevant areas for the POPs management and control were assessed during the NIP development and are listed in the paper. One finding in the NIP assessment was that some of the alternatives used are also bioaccumulative with toxicity in biota and that in the NIP implementation. Also, alternative pesticides in the current use are an issue of concern. Therefore one activity in the implementation of the NIP is the avoidance of regrettable alternatives and the use of more sustainable and green chemicals. © 2021 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.emcon.2021.02.003,Persistent organic pollutants;Kuwait;National implementation plan;Stockholm convention,NA,NA

This study is a comprehensive assessment of consumer exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from a variety of environmental and product-related sources. To identify relevant pathways leading to consumer exposure to PFOS and PFOA a scenario-based approach has been applied. Scenarios represent realistic situations where age- and gender-specific exposure occurs in the everyday life of consumers. We find that North American and European consumers are likely to experience ubiquitous and long-term uptake doses of PFOS and PFOA in the range of 3 to 220 ng per kg body weight per day (ng/kg bw/day) and 1 to 130 ng/kgbw/day, respectively. The greatest portion of the chronic exposure to PFOS and PFOA is likely to result from the intake of contaminated foods, including drinking water. Consumer products cause a minor portion of the consumer exposure to PFOS and PFOA. Of these, it is mainly impregnation sprays, treated carpets in homes, and coated food contact materials that may lead to consumer exposure to PFOS and PFOA. Children tend to experience higher total uptake doses (on a body weight basis) than teenagers and adults because of higher relative uptake via food consumption and hand-to-mouth transfer of chemical from treated carpets and ingestion of dust. The uptake estimates based on scenarios are within the range of values derived from blood serum data by applying a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. © 2008 Society for Risk Analysis.",NA,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01017.x,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Environmental Monitoring;Europe;Adolescent;Environmental Exposure;Infant;Child;Dust;environmental exposure;female;male;Male;nonhuman;controlled study;food contamination;Environmental Pollutants;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;pollution exposure;surfactant;risk assessment;sulfonate;human;Adult;article;body weight;drinking water;toxicokinetics;water contamination;food intake;organofluorine;Surface active agents;PFOA;ambient air;Consumer products;biological uptake;food quality;North America;Perfluorinated chemicals;health survey;house dust;Eurasia;Octanoic Acids;Water Pollutants;water quality;Chemical;Preschool;Air Pollution;Indoor;Impregnation;consumer advocacy;Consumer exposure;Exposure analysis;Impregnation sprays;Risk analysis,NA,NA

Usually, environmental monitoring studies consider classical persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, the lists of POPs keep continuously growing and new POPs and other emerging pollutants should be considered in new monitoring programs. So, this study aimed to investigate the distribution and profile of classical POPs (polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), new POPs and emerging pollutants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), novel halogenated flame retardants (NFRs) and UV filters) in bivalve mollusc samples (both raft-cultivated and wild mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis; cockle, Cerestoderma edule; and clam, Ruditapes descussatus) collected in nine Galician Rias during the period February 2012 to February 2013. A predominance of PAHs (6.8–317 ng/g dry weight (dw)) followed by PCBs (0.47–261 ng/g dw), UV filters (1.4–157 ng/g dw), PFCs (0.53–62 ng/g dw), OCPs (0.07–29 ng/g dw), PBDEs (0.31–6.6 ng/g dw) and NFRs (0.07–3.2 ng/g dw) was found in the studied bivalves, being the UV filter octocrylene the compound found at the highest concentration (141 ng/g dw in a cockle sample), while the PAHs chrysene and benzo(b)fluoranthene were the compounds with the highest average concentration (20 and 14 ng/g dw, respectively). Inter-species, temporal and geographical variations on pollutants concentration were assessed by multifactorial analysis of variance. Statistically significant differences among the type of mollusc were observed for levels of organochlorinated and organobrominated pollutants considered (PCBs, OCPs and PBDEs), which were detected at higher concentrations in wild mussel. On the other hand, the main PFCs and UV filters showed a higher detection frequency in cockle samples. Location played significant role for PAHs, PCBs and the main PBDEs, being the most polluted rias those more industrialized and populated, i.e. A Coruña, Ferrol and/or Vigo. Finally, sampling timepoint was also a significant factor for most of the families considered but with different profiles. Thus, PAHs and PCBs showed higher concentrations in both February 2012 and 2013 and lower in August 2012, while the main PBDEs were measured at higher concentrations in November 2012 and lower in February 2012; and the main NFRs, PFCs and UV filters were present at lower levels in February 2013. © 2019 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.018,Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Pesticides;Hydrocarbons;Spain;Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers;animal;concentration (parameter);Marine pollution;nonhuman;Organic pollutants;polychlorinated biphenyl;environmental monitoring;persistent organic pollutant;chemistry;water pollutant;pollution monitoring;chlorinated hydrocarbon;Emerging pollutants;flame retardant;Flame retardants;PCB;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;pesticide;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;priority journal;diphenyl ether derivative;limit of quantitation;limit of detection;room temperature;PBDE;PAH;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons;coastal waters;bivalve;Bivalvia;Pollution detection;Shellfish;Molluscs;marine pollution;pollutant transport;feasibility study;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Chlorinated;freeze drying;zirconium oxide;Mytilus galloprovincialis;Cultivation;cockle;benzo[b]fluoranthene;Bivalve mollusc;Bivalve molluscs;Cerastoderma edule;chrysene;Classical POPs;Galicia [Spain];Galician coast;Galician coasts;Mollusca;New POPs;Ruditapes;Ruditapes descussatus;Military Personnel,NA,NA

The specific distribution patterns of PFASs in each matrix showed the influences of surrounding environments and different physicochemical characteristics of each congener. These findings suggest that the industrial complex and WWTP might be major emission sources to air and aquatic environments, respectively.

The daily intake of PCBs, PBDEs and PFASs through traditional seafood items in Greenland was assessed. Based on the presented levels of contaminants, in combination with earlier food intake studies, suggests that the daily exposure was below the tolerable daily intake threshold for all compounds. BDE-47 was the only PBDE-congener detected in all food items, except in smoked halibut. The levels of BDE-47 varied from < LOD in smoked halibut up to 18 ng/g lw in narwhal mattak and 21 ng/g lw in whale beef. ∑PCB were lowest in smoked halibut (37 ng/g lw) and highest in narwhal mattak with 1,146 ng/g lw.

Nevertheless, there is a dearth of measurements of contaminants in the Open Ocean lower atmosphere, water column and trophic chain as a result of its remoteness and wide spatial reach. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are an important class of chemical contaminants due to their particular characteristics such as persistency, bioaccumulation potential, high toxicity and long range environmental transport capacity. Even though previous studies report their occurrence in the marine environment, the processes and magnitude of their fate, transport and sinks in the Open Ocean remain uncharacterized. In this Thesis two groups of organic contaminants have been selected in order to study POPs dynamics and fate in the oceanic environment. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic pollutants generated during incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and organic matter, but as well coming from petrogenic and biogenic natural sources. PAHs are semivolatile and highly mobile between the atmosphere and aqueous systems. Perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) are anthropogenic halogenated pollutants, recently developed for industrial and consumer goods usage. They are extremely persistent and exhibit higher solubility and lower hydrophobicity than most POPs, which makes them prone to be found in aqueous matrixes. During the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation cruise across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans (35°N- 40°S), 64 PAHs were measured in the gas, aerosol, rainwater, dissolved, particulate and plankton matrixes, and 11 PFASs were quantified in dissolved phase at surface and deep chlorophyll maximum depth seawater.

This study was focused on the lead concentrations and isotope ratios in the PM10 of Zaragoza, in order to determine the main Pb pollution sources and to check whether the influence of the prohibition of leaded fuel was worthwhile. Two sampling campaigns from 2001 until 2004, the first one in which leaded gasoline was still effective and the second one with the phase-out, were carried out by using a high-volume air sampler able to trap the particulate matter equal to or less than 10 mu m (PM10) on Teflon-coated fibre glass filters. Firstly, the Pb concentrations for the two sampling campaigns were analysed by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). No statistically significant decrease in the Pb average concentration was obtained from the first to the second sampling. Enrichment factors showed that anthropogenic sources were prevalent during both samplings, in particular during 2001-2002. Afterwards, only those samples with higher concentrations than the limit of quantification of Pb were analysed to determine the lead isotopic composition by inductively-coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS). To apply this analytical technique successfully, it was necessary to optimize the parameters affecting the measurement accuracy and precision. Differences were found regarding the lead isotope ratios for both periods finding that anthropogenic sources related to industrial processes were reflected on both campaigns. The gasoline contribution for the first campaign was 23% whereas for the second sampling this contribution was negligible, corroborating the success of the lead policies on the quality of the environment.",NA,10.1039/b912274e,Spain;Spectrometry;Air pollution measurement;Air quality;Gasoline;Lead &amp;Lead isotopes;Particulate matter;the environment;Zaragoza (Spain),NA,NA

However, the distribution of PFOA in different tissues is a complex physiological process affected by many factors. It is difficult to be accurately described by a simple kinetic model. In present study, a new strategy was introduced to research the PFOA distribution in tissues and estimate the exposure stages. Zebrafish were continuously exposed to 25 mg/L PFOA for 30 days to simulate environmental process. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) method was used to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of PFOA in zebrafish tissues. By analyzing the law of change obtained from the high spatial resolution MSI data, two different enrichment trends in ten tissues were summarized by performing curve fitting.

In the present study, based on the local diet, edible parts of rice, vegetables, fish, and their corresponding soils and irrigation/aquaculture water were investigated in a typical Chinese city (Changshu). The concentrations of total perfluoroalkyl acids (ΣPFAAs) in the edible parts of rice /vegetables and fish tissues ranged from 26.69 to 37.09 ng/g dw, 12.93 to 40.77 ng/g dw, and 13.27 to 29.82 ng/g ww, with perfluorohexanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) as the most dominant compounds. The PFAA concentrations in the corresponding rice soils, vegetable soils, irrigation water, and aquaculture water ranged from 11.99 to 26.33 ng/g dw, 14.06 to 36.19 ng/g dw, 141.36 to 297.00 ng/L, and 179.23 to 235.82 ng/L, respectively. Biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) values for the plant-soil system were far greater than those for bioaccumulation factor (BAF) values for the plant-irrigation water system. PFAAs were more inclined to accumulate in the gills of fish as determined by their highest BAF values. Correlation analysis showed that PFAAs in root vegetables had a stronger correlation with those in soil compared with those in irrigation water. Source analysis showed that emissions from fluoride industries, textiles, and food industries may be the dominant sources of PFAAs in agricultural environments. The estimated dietary intake (EDI) for the selected diet was lower than that for rice/vegetables but was higher than that found in fish.

The defluorination of PFOA was governed primarily by alkaline strength while BC-ZVI could enhance reaction kinetics by 2.4 times. Adsorption of the intermediates to BC-ZVI resulted in near-complete removal of all fluorinated compounds (with the exception of perfluoracetic acid) in the aqueous phase within 15 min of reaction. After 4 h of alkaline hydrothermal treatment (240 °C and 250 mM NaOH) with BC-ZVI, defluorination efficiency of PFOA of 99.7% was observed. Perfluoracetic acid was the only persistent byproduct but accounted only for less than 1% of the initial PFOA. DFT analysis also showed that strong alkaline conditions could decrease the reaction energy barrier by 73.9% due to the decarboxylation of PFOA via nucleophilic substitution.

Salinity depth profiles indicated the reservoir was stratified with lower layers consisting of sea water (salinity ranging from 32 to 35 g L-1) and a brackish surface layer containing approximately 14-65% seawater. The PFC mixture detected in catchment waters contained perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs), particularly perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorohexanoate (PFHpA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and PFC transformation products. PFC concentrations in storm runoff were generally higher than those in dry weather flow of canals and rivers. PFC concentration profiles measured during storm events indicated 'first flush' behavior, probably because storm water is leaching PFC compounds from non-point sources present in the catchment area. Storm runoff carries high concentrations of suspended solids (SS), which suggests that PFC transport is via SS. In Marina Bay, PFCs are deposited in the sediments along with the SS. In sediments, the total PFC concentration was 4,700 ng kg-1, approximately 200 times higher than in the bottom water layers. Total perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs), particularly PFOS and 6:2 fluoro telomer sulfonate (6:2 FtS) were dominant PFCs in the sediments. PFC sorption by sediments varied with perfluorocarbon chain length, type of functional group and sediment characteristics. A first approximation analysis based on SS transport suggested that the annual PFC input into the reservoir was approximately 35 ± 12 kgy-1. Contributions of SS, dry weather flow of river/canals, and rainfall were approximately 70, 25 and 5%, respectively.

Objective: We investigated whether epithelia from Fallopian tubes (FTs) bearing an ectopic pregnancy differ from normal tubes in expression of TGF-beta family and related proteins and their receptors. Methodology: Because it is not possible to collect FTs from women carrying a healthy pregnancy, we studied tissue collected at the time of hysterectomy for benign disease. Women were injected with human chorionic gonadotropin in the days leading up to hysterectomy to produce a state of pseudopregnancy. Pseudopregnancy status was confirmed by the presence of high serum progesterone levels and the decidualization of the endometrium. Fifteen FTs bearing ectopic pregnancy and six pseudopregnant tubes were collected and examined using immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated clear staining for the beta A- and beta B-subunits, type II receptor group comprising the activin type IIA and type IIB receptors, and follistatin, which increased in intensity from the isthmus to the ampulla in both models. However, the intensity of expression of these molecules was stronger in the ectopic pregnancy group when compared with the pseudopregnant group. Quantitative RT-PCR showed significant decrease in mRNA levels of beta A-subunit, activin type IIA and IIB receptors, and follistatin in ectopic group (P < 0.05) but no changes in OB-subunit (P > 0.05). Overall, there was an apparent paradox of high concentration of protein but low mRNA expression. Conclusion: Activin-A may stimulate tubal decidualization and trophoblast invasion.

In this study, the occurrences and trophic behaviors were demonstrated for OH- and MeO-PBDEs using the biota samples collected from Dalian, a coastal city near Chinese Bohai Sea. Sigma OH-PBDEs exhibited a wider concentration range (<MDL (method detection limit) -25 ng/g dry weight (dw)) compared with Sigma MeO-PBDEs (<MDL-2 ng/g dw) and Sigma PBDEs (<MDL-2 ng/g dw). The congener profiles and distribution patterns revealed that majority of OH- and MeO-PBDEs in marine biota were naturally produced and largely attributed to preying on lower trophic level biota. Though tertiary consumers accumulated more MeO-PBDEs and PBDEs, these chemicals did not show statistically significant biomagnification in the selected food web. Conversely, trophic dilution was determined for ortho-substituted OH-tetraBDEs and OH-pentaBDEs, revealing that trophic dilution was prevalent for naturally produced OH-PBDEs. The dietary intake evaluation of OH-PBDEs (0.4 ng/kg/d) and MeO-PBDEs (0.8 ng/kg/d) via seafood consumption showed that coastal residents were in higher exposure risks to OH-PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs via the massive seafood consumption.

The individually determined analytes, besides PFOA, included also other perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) of alkyl chain length from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, and pefluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). The determination of TOF was carried out with use of defluorination employing radical reaction with sodium biphenyl. Released fluoride ions were transformed into triphenylfluorosilane, which was then determined using GC/FID method. In all examined samples of tap and river waters as well as milk, the ng/L level of commonly occurring PFOA and PFOS was found (except PFOS, which was not detected in one examined sample of tap water from Warsaw). Among determined PFCAs in water samples, different levels of C7-PFCA and C9-PFCA were found, whereas in milk samples it was mostly C7-PFCA. In all examined samples the content of other perfluorinated compounds reached from 12-13% up to even 60-80% in case of 2 water samples. These values show convincingly the importance of determination of TOF as the most informative parameter determining the content of that group of pollutants in environmental and food samples.

The method employs stableisotope labeled internal standard (IS) and surrogate recover standard (SRS) spiked serum or plasma samples that are mixed and precipitated with acetonitrile. Quantitation is performed with stable-isotope IS solvent (50 : 50 acetonitrile : water) calibration using one direct injection (DI) chromatographic analysis of precipitated sample supernate. The analytical method includes fifteen stable isotope labeled ISs, four SRSs ([1,2,3,4-C-13(4)]PFOA, [1,2-C-13(2)]PFUnA, [1,2,3,4-C-13(4)]PFOS, [2,3,4-C-13(3)]PFBA), and sixteen target analytes perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (C4-C12), perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) (C4, C6, C8), N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetate (EtFOSAA), N-methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetate (MeFOSAA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), and perfluorobutane sulfonamide (FBSA).

Although PFAS have been detected in surface waters globally, this is the first report of PFAS in a deep (170–400 m) demersal species in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Golden Tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps) plasma extracts (n = 185) were investigated for the presence of PFAS using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A subset of liver tissues (n = 51) were also analyzed for microscopic hepatic changes (MHCs). Overall, nine of the 110 PFAS targeted were detected in Tilefish plasma at relatively high frequencies. Plasma concentrations of total PFAS (Σ9PFAS) ranged from below the detection limit to 27.9 ng g−1 w.w. Significant regional differences were observed with the highest concentrations of PFAS detected in the north central region of the GoM, where substantial industrialization and discharges from the Mississippi River occur. Compared to most wildlife and matrices analyzed globally, the PFAS profiles in Tilefish were unique as they are dominated by PFUnDA. Profile differences are hypothesized to be the result of Tilefish's distinctive lifestyle, habitat, diet, and partitioning characteristics of long-chain PFAS. Several MHCs were identified in this subset of Tilefish that could be detrimental to their health. Significant correlations between PFAS concentrations and biometric indices and MHCs were evident, however, additional research is needed to investigate the role PFAS and PFAS combined with chemical admixtures may play in inducing observed hepatic changes and other physiological effects in Tilefish. These findings give insight into the fate of PFAS at depth in aquatic ecosystems and are cause for concern regarding the health of other deep water benthic biota in GoM and other deepwater sinks for PFAS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151143,Fish;Fluorocarbons;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Liver;Mississippi;ecosystem;Ecosystem;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;animal experiment;environmental monitoring;alkyl group;animal tissue;chemistry;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Mass spectrometry;diet;fish;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;concentration (composition);liquid chromatography;blood level;liver;mass spectrometry;environmental fate;ultra performance liquid chromatography;polyfluoroalkyl substance;limit of detection;Long chains;correlational study;Atlantic Ocean;habitat;Anthropogenic pollutants;High performance liquid chromatography;lifestyle;Water Pollutants;microscopy;benthos;Chemical;continental shelf;Deepwater;Aquatic ecosystems;Gulf of Mexico;Per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances;demersal fish;Demersal;Electric discharges;Long-chain PFCA;Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps;PFUndA;Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometries;Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry,NA,NA

Solid phase extraction (SPE) method based on Oasis HLB cartridges were used to concentrate and clean-up the samples. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of these chemical compounds revealed the simultaneous presence of at least 12 compounds in different parts of the selected fish species in nanogram-per-gram dry weight (ng/g dw) concentrations. The results revealed that perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid and perfluoroheptanoic acid were the most predominant among the perfluorinated compounds and ranged between: (20.13–179.2 ng/g), (21.22–114.0 ng/g) and (40.06–138.3 ng/g). Also, diclofenac had the highest concentration in these edible fish species out of all the pharmaceuticals detected (range: 551.8–1812 ng/g). The risk assessment values were above 0.5 and 1.0 for acute and chronic risk respectively which shows that these chemicals have a high health risk to the pelagic fish, aquatic organisms and to humans who consume them. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a precautionary approach and the adequate regulation of the use and disposal of synthetic chemicals that persist in aquatic/marine environment in this province and other parts of South Africa, to prevent impacts on the sustainability of our marine environment, livelihood and lives.

In this paper we present the results of a three decade (1983-2013) risk assessment of OHC exposure and effects on reproduction, immunity, and cancer (genotoxicity) in polar bears from Central East Greenland. Risk of adverse effects are evaluated using a risk quotient (RQ) approach with derivation from measured OHC concentrations in polar bear tissue and critical body residues (CBR) extrapolated for polar bears using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling (PBPK). The additive RQs for all OHCs in polar bears were above the threshold for all effect categories (RQ > 1) in every year, suggesting this population has been at significant and continuous risk of contaminant-mediated effects for over three decades. RQs peaked in 1983 (RQ > 58) and again in 2013 (RQ > 50) after a period of decline. These trends follow Sigma PCB levels during that time, and contributed almost all of the risk to immune, reproductive, and carcinogenic effects (71-99% of total RQ). The recent spike in RQs suggests a major shift in polar bear contaminant exposure from climate related changes in food composition and hereby the increased risk of adverse health effects. In the context of lifetime exposure Sigma PCB and PFOS levels showed the interactive importance of year of birth, age, and emission history. In conclusion, the results indicate that East Greenland polar bears have been exposed to OHC levels over the period of 1983-2013 that potentially and continuously affected individual and theoretically also population health, with a peaking risk in the more recent years.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2018.05.020,Risk Assessment,NA,NA

An upper limit for the bimolecular reaction rate constant for reaction of •OH and N-EtFOSAA was determined to be (1.7 ± 0.7) × 109 M-1s-1. A proposed reaction pathway for degradation of the parent perfluorochemical, N-EtFOSE, to the other perfluoroalkanesulfonamides and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was developed and includes oxidation and N-dealkylation steps. As they did not undergo additional degradation, perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and PFOA were the final degradation products of hydroxyl radical-initiated oxidation. UV-visible absorption spectra for the perfluorochemicals, showing absorbance in the UV region below the range of natural sunlight, are also reported. In sunlit environments, indirect photolysis of perfluorochemicals is likely to be important in the determination of their environmental fate given the slow rates expected for biotransformation and weak sorption.

To control this disease, antibiotics and chemicals are widely used which can consequently result in ""superbugs"" and chemical accumulation in the food chain. Though vaccine against A. hydrophila is available, its use is limited due to multiple serotypes of this pathogen and problems of safety and efficacy. Another problem with vaccination is the ability to apply it to small fish especially in high numbers. In this study, we tried a new way to attenuate the A. hydrophila infection by using a quorum quenching strategy with a recombinant AHL-lactonase expressed in Pichia pastoris. Results: The AHL-lactonase (AiiA(B546)) from Bacillus sp. B546 was produced extracellularly in P. pastoris with a yield of 3,558.4 +/- 81.3 U/mL in a 3.7-L fermenter when using 3-oxo-C8-HSL as the substrate. After purification with a HiTrap Q Sepharose column, the recombinant homogenous protein showed a band of 33.6 kDa on SDS-PAGE, higher than the calculated molecular mass (28.14 kDa). Deglycosylation of AiiA(B546) with Endo H confirmed the occurrence of N-glycosylation. The purified recombinant AiiA(B546) showed optimal activity at pH 8.0 and 20 degrees C, exhibited excellent stability at pH 8.0-12.0 and thermal stability at 70 degrees C, was firstly confirmed to be significantly protease-resistant, and had wide substrate specificity. In application test, when co-injected with A. hydrophila in common carp, recombinant AiiA(B546) decreased the mortality rate and delayed the mortality time of fish. Conclusions: Our results not only indicate the possibility of mass-production of AHL-lactonase at low cost, but also open up a promising foreground of application of AHL-lactonase in fish to control A. hydrophila disease by regulating its virulence.

This study investigated the developmental and neurobehavioral effects of PFOS exposure (0, 100, 500, and 1000 μg/L) on zebrafish. The findings indicated that PFOS exposure caused various developmental abnormalities, including increased mortality, delayed hatching, shortened body length, bent spine, and edema in the pericardial and yolk sac regions. Subsequently, larvae exhibited a significant decrease in spontaneous movement frequency, altered touch-evoked response, and locomotor behavior. In fact, aberrant cellular responses in the brain and cardiac regions were observed. Microglial activation is a critical component of the inflammatory immune responses related to neurotoxicity. Likewise, our findings indicated that PFOS-induced microglial activation might be responsible for neuronal inflammation and apoptosis. Furthermore, AChE activity and dopamine content at the neurotransmitter level were also disrupted after PFOS exposure. The gene expression of dopamine signaling pathways and neuroinflammation were also altered. Collectively, our findings highlight that PFOS exposure can induce dopaminergic neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation through microglial activation, thus ultimately affecting behavior.

To identify the thermal decomposition products and mechanisms of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), gaseous perfluoropropionic acid (PFPrA) and perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA) were decomposed in nitrogen and oxygen at temperatures from 200 to 780 °C. In nitrogen (i.e., pyrolysis), the primary products of PFPrA were CF2═CF2, CF3CF2H, and CF3COF. CF3CF═CF2 was the dominant product of PFBA. These products are produced by HF elimination (detected as low as 200 °C). CF4 and C2F6 were observed from both PFCAs, suggesting formation of perfluorocarbon radical intermediates. Pyrolysis products were highly thermally stable, resulting in poor defluorination. In oxygen (i.e., combustion), the primary product of both PFPrA and PFBA below 400 °C was COF2, but the primary product was SiF4 above 600 °C due to reactions with the quartz reactor. Oxygen facilitated thermal defluorination by reacting with PFCAs and with pyrolysis products (i.e., fluoroolefins and fluorocarbon radicals).

In this study, based on a national industrial survey and statistics, we estimated the annual release of F-53B across China during the period 2006–2015. We evaluated the global transport and distribution of F-53B using the Globo-POP model, and assessed its environmental risk in regions of China using the EUSES model. Our calculations indicate that approximately 10–14 metric tons (t) of F-53B are released annually into the environment, mainly in East China. Our Globo-POP calculations demonstrate that a limited fraction (0.02–0.50%) of the cumulative F-53B emissions can reach the Arctic via oceanic advection. Despite its low long-range transport potential, F-53B can accumulate in Chinese local waters. Our EUSES calculations predict that the F-53B concentration in fresh water (South China) currently approaches 0.7 mg/L and will reach 2.3 mg/L by 2020 in the region surrounding chromium-plating plants if its use remains uncontrolled. Such an increase in concentration implies a potential risk to aquatic environments.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to determine bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs), activation energies, and other chemical properties. Calculated parameters were used to determine the functional groups most likely to be present based on the level of fluorination and the position of fluorines. In compounds that form C–O bonds, the presence of α-fluorines significantly strengthens the C–O bond by ∼4–18 kcal/mol. The results of this study indicate that fluoroalkyl alcohols are a very likely product of the disposal of munitions. This work was designed to expedite the analytical process of confirming that PFAS are created from current disposal methods of energetic devices by providing insight as to of what types of compounds should be expected. The PFAS generated in such reactions are expected to contain some functional groups (i.e., nitro and nitrite) that have not been known to exist as a result of the environmental degradation of industrially relevant PFAS, therefore, they may have been overlooked before. These initial results imply that PFAS with nitro functionalities may be formed in these conditions considering the abundance of NO2 radicals expected to be present as well as the strength of the C–N bond that can form (∼40–50 kcal/mol) whereas with nitroso functionalities are not expected to be found since the bonds formed are much weaker (∼25–35 kcal/mol), and nitrosoalkanes are known to decompose under mild conditions.

Wild boars become exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) from flora, fauna, water, and soil. The main exposure pathway to PFOA and PFOS is assumed to be the oral intake. From studies in domestic pigs (belonging to the same species Sus scrofa), it has been established that the oral exposure results in the liver accumulation of PFOA and PFOS. Thus, we posit that wild boars can be quantitatively used as suitable bioindicators for the presence of these substances in the environment. After the environmental pollution case in the Hessian region Sauerland in 2006, monitoring programs of individual Federal States from 2007 to 2013 showed that almost all wild boar liver samples contained PFOA and PFOS. In 2014, the analyses of PFOA and PFOS in liver of wild boars hunted in the south, north, and west of Germany showed liver concentrations at the same level among regions. Overall, an average ratio of PFOS:PFOA concentration in liver of 20.5:1 was found. To estimate the actual ratio of PFOS:PFOA in the wild boars’ dietary exposure, we performed toxicokinetic modeling. According to the model, the PFOS exposure is only 2.2 times that of PFOA (because PFOS has slower elimination kinetics and higher affinity for the liver than PFOA). Overall, the determination of PFOA and PFOS in liver of wild boars indicates that both substances are ubiquitously distributed in the environment.

However, there are limited studies on their bioaccumulation mechanisms, especially for short-chain PFAAs. In this study, we examined the binding affinity of PFAAs with fish serum proteins and tissue distributions of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (C7-C11 PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (C4, C6, and C8 PFSAs) in carp (Cyprinus carpio), including the isomers of PFOS and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS). For both PFCAs and PFSAs, the fish serum protein binding constant (K A ) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) increased with an increase in the carbon chain length. PFHxS (C6 PFSA) had a much higher K A but displayed a much lower BCF than those of C7-C11 PFCAs. It indicated that not only fish blood proteins, but also other proteins in the liver and kidney, mediated the accumulation of PFAAs in fish. The lowest concentration ratios of PFHxS in liver to blood and in kidney to blood suggested that it could not be effectively transported to liver and kidney by fatty acid binding proteins and organic anion transporters. PFOS and PFHxS displayed different elimination pathways, although their linear (n-) isomers were accumulated more in fish than the corresponding branched (br-) isomers. The n-PFOS was eliminated more via the feces but br-PFOS was eliminated more via the urine; while the opposite trend was observed for PFHxS isomers. © 2018",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.099,Biochemistry;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Carboxylation;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Bioaccumulation;Tissue Distribution;animal;Blood;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;binding affinity;Binding energy;perfluoroalkanoic acid;protein;water pollutant;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;concentration (composition);alkanesulfonic acid;surfactant;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;Fatty acids;liver;serum;urine;kidney;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;priority journal;blood;tissue distribution;perfluorononanoic acid;metabolism;fatty acid binding protein;perfluorobutane sulfonate;protein binding;half life time;physiology;feces;carp;Carps;Tissue distributions;Isomers;Cyprinus carpio;sea food;Seafood;cyprinid;Proteins;concentration (parameters);molecular analysis;perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid;Chains;Protein Binding;Alkanesulfonates;Isomer;Plants (botany);Carbon-chain length;Concentration ratio;Water Pollutants;Chemical;organic anion transporter;Cyprinidae;Bioconcentration factor;Fatty acid-binding proteins;elimination rate constant;carbon chain length;rate constant;plasma protein;Bioaccumulation mechanism;elimination pathway;Protein binding affinity;quenching rate constant;uptake rate constant;Carrier Proteins,NA,NA

Distribution factors were calculated for each test compound to illustrate the disposition of PFASs in rainbow trout after 28 d of exposure. Dietary exposure of market-size rainbow trout to PFASs did not result in biomagnification; BMF values were calculated as 0.42 for PFOS, >0.23 for PFNA, >0.18 for PFHxS, >0.04 for PFOA, and >0.02 for PFBS, which are below the biomagnification threshold of 1. Liver, blood, kidney, and skin were identified as the main target tissues for PFASs in market-size rainbow trout.

Potential effects of PFCs alone and combined effects by complex mixture of PFCs and dioxins and related compounds (DRCs) were also assessed by gene expression profiling using a cormorant oligo array. Perfluorooctanesulfonate, PFNA, and PFOSA were detected in almost all liver samples analyzed, while concentrations of PFHS and PFOA were below the limit of quantification. The microarray data analyses revealed that hepatic PFC levels were correlated with the expression of 74 genes. Real-time reverse-transcript polymerase chain reaction data demonstrated that PFOS concentration was positively correlated with mRNA levels of glutathione peroxidase 1 and glutathione S-transferase alpha 3 and negatively correlated with levels of heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 and tumor rejection antigen 1 mRNAs. These results suggest the induction of antioxidant enzymes in response to oxidative stress caused by PFCs and the suppression of molecular chaperones, leading to reduction in protein stability. Moreover, multiple regression analyses identified seven significant models in which certain genes showed expression levels altered by accumulation of PFCs and DRCs. The regression models explained associations with cytochrome P450 1A mRNA and protein expression levels, and its catalytic activity, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase of both PFNA and the 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalent levels. Thus, the regression models suggested the potential of PFCs to enhance toxicities of DRCs. Since mixture toxicity is an urgent issue, further study is required to understand the effects of mixtures of PFCs and DRCs in wild cormorants. © 2008 SETAC.",NA,10.1897/07-614.1,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Birds;Animals;Sulfur compounds;Liver;RNA;Sulfonic Acids;Sulfonamides;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Japan;Climate change;female;male;Male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;Mixture toxicity;Mixtures;animal tissue;perfluoro compound;protein;Gene expression;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;regression analysis;Regression analysis;oxidative stress;perfluorooctane sulfonamide;gene expression;Toxicity;Perfluorinated compounds;article;ecotoxicology;priority journal;pollution effect;polymerase chain reaction;protein expression;molecular weight;waterfowl;fluorination;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;sulfonamide;enzyme activity;ethoxyresorufin deethylase;tissue level;gene expression profiling;messenger RNA;dioxin;Proteins;oxidation;glutathione peroxidase;Bioactivity;fluorine;Phalacrocorax carbo;Enzymes;Asia;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Eurasia;cytochrome;Octanoic Acids;Phalacrocoracidae;Acids;Concentration (process);cytochrome P450 1A;Far East;DNA microarray;protein stability;catalysis;lake ecosystem;2;3;7;8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin;tumor;genomics;Honshu;ABS resins;Biwa Lake;Common cormorant;Dioxin-related compounds;glutathione transferase alpha;heat shock protein 70;Kinki;real time;Shiga;Toxicogenomics;Gene Expression;Transcriptome,NA,NA

However, little is known about the isomeric compositions of PFASs in daily intake and their impacts on isomeric profiles in humans. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of PFASs with isomeric analysis in various human exposure matrices including foodstuffs, tap water and indoor dust. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and/or perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) were predominant in these exposure matrices collected in Tianjin, China. In fish and meat, linear (n-) PFOA was enriched with a percentage of 92.2% and 99.6%, respectively. Although n-PFOS was higher in fish (84.8%) than in technical PFOS (ca. 70%), it was much lower in meat (63.1%) and vegetables (58.5%). Dietary intake contributed >. 99% of the estimated daily intake (EDI) for the general population. The isomeric profiles of PFOA and PFOS in human serum were predicted based on the EDI and a one-compartment, first-order pharmacokinetic model. The isomeric percentage of n-PFOA in the EDI (98.6%) was similar to that in human serum (predicted: 98.2%, previously measured: 99.7%) of Tianjin residents. The results suggest direct PFOA intake plays an important role in its isomeric compositions in humans. For PFOS, the predicted n-PFOS (69.3%) was much higher than the previously measured values (59.2%) in human serum. This implies that other factors, such as indirect exposure to PFOS precursors and multiple excretion pathways, may contribute to the lower percentage of n-PFOS in humans than of technical PFOS. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2016.01.002,Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Vegetables;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Meat;Chromatography;High Pressure Liquid;Food Contamination;China;Environmental Exposure;Dust;animal;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;controlled study;dietary intake;food contamination;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;chemical substance;chemistry;Health risks;Human exposures;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;high performance liquid chromatography;vegetable;risk assessment;Risk assessment;fruit;human;serum;Nutrition;drinking water;priority journal;blood;metabolism;meat;limit of detection;Drinking Water;food consumption;analysis;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;PFOA;health risk;Isomers;dust;Fishes;Human exposure;concentration (parameters);Estimated daily intakes;tap water;Potential health risks;Foodstuffs;Isomerism;isomerism;Tianjin;Fruit;Humanities;Humanism,NA,NA

All three compounds have been studied over several years for toxicity mechanism; however, a clear view of their ability to bind to DNA has not been supplied empirically. In this work, a simulation study is done to reveal the interaction of three of these pollutants, bis(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), butylparaben (BPRB), and the protonated form of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS(H)), with DNA. The results show that the DEHP, PFOS(H), and BPRB bind with a probability of 1/5 to DNA, with respective bonding energies -23.96 kJ/mol (PFOS(H)), -94.92 kJ/mol (BPRB), and -216.52 kJ/mol (DEHP). The positive control, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BAP), which is known for its notorious DNA intercalation, binds at a rate of 3/5 simulations, with bonding energies of -6544.52, -7034.66, and -7578.67 kJ/mol. The results are compared to empirical studies and conclusively show that all these pollutants can interfere with transcription and DNA related mechanisms by forming noncovalent interactions with DNA. The results show also that these pollutants are unlikely to undergo strong noncovalent intercalation to DNA, such as BAP, and do not possess the frontier orbital profiles to undergo adduct formation. After many years of research and several unanswered questions on the action of these pollutants on DNA, a calculation on their properties hence to the DNA confirms that there is a low probability for these to undergo a strong intercalation with DNA. Literature shows however that the pollutants are strongly interfering with the protein machinery and receptors on the cell surface and are therefore still priority pollutants for ecotoxicity research. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.chemrestox.7b00265,"Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;DNA;Article;fluorocarbon;comparative study;controlled study;ecotoxicity;chemistry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;drug effect;4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester;human;computer model;molecular dynamics;butyl paraben;air pollutant;calculation;Parabens;benzo[a]pyrene;protein p53;chemical binding;proton transport;phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester;chemical interaction;Diethylhexyl Phthalate;Benzo(a)pyrene;dihydroxybenzo[a]pyrene oxide;DNA fragment;empiricism;energy absorption;interactions with DNA;intercalating agent;Intercalating Agents;Molecular Dynamics Simulation;peptidyltransferase;quantum theory;Quantum Theory;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA, A-Form;DNA, B-Form;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase",NA,NA

The PFASs included perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA). The DOM included humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), tannic acid (TA), and a protein, peptone (PEP), and their concentrations ranged from 0 to 50 mg L-1. The results showed that, upon bioconcentration equilibrium, the body burdens of longer perfluoroalkyl chain PFASs (PFOS, PFDA, PFUnA and PFDoA) decreased with PEP and HA concentrations while increased with FA and TA concentrations. When FA and TA concentrations increased from 0 to 50 mg L-1, body burdens of these PFASs increased by 7.5%-148.8% and 5.7%-37.1%, respectively. However, the DOM had no significant impact on the body burdens of shorter perfluoroalkyl chain PFASs (PFOA and PFNA). All of the four types of DOM lowered not only the uptake rate constants (k(u)) of PFASs due to the decrease of freely dissolved PFAS concentrations, but also the elimination rate constants (k(e)) due to the inhibition effect of DOM on the PFAS elimination from the larvae. The reduction in the two constants varied with both DOM and PFAS types. In the presence of PEP and HA with larger molecular weights, the k(u) values decreased more than k(e), leading to the decreased body burdens of longer perfluoroalkyl chain PFASs. As for FA and TA with smaller molecular weights, the k(e) values decreased more than k(u), resulting in increased body burdens of longer perfluoroalkyl chain PFASs. This study suggests that the effects of DOM on PFAS bioconcentration depend not only on the concentration but also on the molecule weight of DOM, which should be considered in the bioavailability assessment of PFASs.

Apart from a few well-studied PFAS, the structure-related toxicokinetics of a broader set of PFAS remain unclear. Objectives: To understand the toxicokinetics of PFAS, we attempted to characterize the metabolism pathways of 74 structurally diverse PFAS samples from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s PFAS screening library. Methods: Using the early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model, we determined the bioconcentration factors and phenotypic toxicities of 74 PFAS. Then, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry-based nontargeted analysis to identify metabolites of PFAS in zebrafish larvae after 5 d of exposure by incorporating retention time and mass spectra. In vitro enzymatic activity experiments with human recombinant liver carboxylesterase (hCES1) were employed to validate the structure-related hydrolysis of 11 selected PFAS. Results: Our findings identified five structural categories of PFAS prone to metabolism. The metabolism pathways of PFAS were highly related to their structures as exemplified by fluorotelomer alcohols that the predominance of β-oxidation or taurine conjugation pathways were primarily determined by the number of hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis was identified as a major metabolism pathway for diverse PFAS, and perfluoroalkyl carboxamides showed the highest in vivo hydrolysis rates, followed by carboxyesters and sulfonamides. The hydrolysis of PFAS was verified with recombinant hCES1, with strong substrate preferences toward perfluoroalkyl carboxamides. Conclusions: We suggest that the roadmap of the structure-related metabolism pathways of PFAS established in this study would provide a starting point to inform the potential health risks of other PFAS. © 2021, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This review paper aims to highlight the metabolism of diclofenac at different trophic levels, its occurrence, ecological risks, and interactive effects in the water cycle and biota over the past two decades. Increased exposure to diclofenac not only raises health concerns for vultures, aquatic organisms, and higher plants but also causes serious threats to mammals. The ubiquitous nature of diclofenac in surface water (river, lake canal, estuary, and sea) is compared with drinking water, groundwater, and wastewater effluent in the environment. This comprehensive survey from previous studies suggests the fate of diclofenac in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and may predict its persistence in the environment. This review offers evidence of fragmentary available data for the water environment, soil, sediment, and biota worldwide and supports the need for further data to address the risks associated with the presence of diclofenac in the environment. Finally, we suggest that the presence of diclofenac and its metabolites in the environment may represent a high risk because of their synergistic interactions with existing contaminants, leading to the development of drug-resistant strains and the formation of newly emerging pollutants.

PFASs poses an issue to both wildlife and humans because of different toxic properties. Different PFASs have been found to effect different hormones, are possibly carcinogenic, or can affect metabolic function. Many initiatives have been started by countries, organisations, and companies to prevent PFASs from ending up in the environment. Aquatic environments are a sink for PFASs, and much research has been done on the marine environment and its residents to investigate the effects of these substances. In earlier research, the need for a time-line perspective combined with both a total fluorine analysis and mass spectrometry analysis has been pointed out. This study's objective was to investigate how the concentrations of known and unknown bioaccumulating organic fluorinated substances in pilot whales are evolving over time. The results show fluctuating levels of PFASs for the different whales, making it hard to view any trends. There is a pattern of the unknown organic fluorine, that is increasing after 2009 when the phase-out of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) happened. The highest amount of unknown fluorine is 77% in one of the samples. Short-chain PFASs seems to be a good short-term solution as a replacement for the long-chain PFASs but could pose a threat over a longer time perspective.

Previous in vitro tests showed that branched PFOS-precursors were biotransformed faster than the corresponding linear isomer. Thus, high percentages of branched PFOS may be a biomarker of PFOS-precursor exposure in humans. We evaluated this hypothesis by examining the isomer-specific fate of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), a known PFOS-precursor, in male Sprague Dawley rats exposed to commercial PFOSA via food for 77 days (83.0 +/- 20.4 ng kg(-1) day(-1)), followed by 27 days of depuration. Elimination half-lives of the two major branched PFOSA isomers (2.5 +/- 1.0 days and 3.7 +/- 1.2 days) were quicker than for linear PFOSA (5.9 +/- 4.6 days), resulting in a depletion of branched PFOSA isomers in blood and tissues relative to the dose. A corresponding increase in the total branched isomer content of PFOS, the ultimate metabolite, in rat serum was not observed. However, a significant enrichment of 5m-PFOS and a significant depletion of 1m-PFOS were observed, relative to authentic electrochemical PFOS. The data cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, due to known differences in the toxicokinetics of PFOS in rodents and humans. However, the results confirm that in vivo exposure to commercially relevant PFOS-precursors can result in a distinct PFOS isomer profile that may be useful as a biomarker of exposure source.",NA,10.1021/es204028v,"Biotransformation;Rats;Sprague-Dawley;Sulfonamides;Rats, Sprague-Dawley",NA,NA

Diet has been considered as an important source for human exposure to PFAAs and seafood accounts for a relatively large proportion in human diets, especially for coastal residents. In an effort to clarify the impact of PFAAs in seafood on human health, 17 PFAAs were determined in 42 pooled seafood samples (14 species) from the Yellow Sea areas, China. The concentrations of total PFAAs (sum of 17 PFAAs, ∑PFAAs) were in the range of 1.10–1067 ng/g dry weight (dw), with the highest concentration found in swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) and the lowest in silvery pomfret (Pampus argenteus). Concentrations and composition profiles of PFAAs varied significantly among different species, suggesting that bioaccumulation potential of PFAAs differed from species to species. The distinct spatial distribution of PFAAs in four categories of seafood could be mainly attributed to the contamination patterns of PFAAs in three nearby cities. PFBA was presented as the most abundant PFAA in this study, which was different from the findings in many other studies where PFOS was the predominant compound. Furthermore, the human health risk assessment suggested that a comprehensive action plan is needed to protect people from high exposure to PFAAs through seafood consumption. © 2019",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.165,Biochemistry;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFAAs;Persistent organic pollutants;Environmental Monitoring;Bioaccumulation;Food Contamination;China;Risk Assessment;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;food contamination;Organic pollutants;bioaccumulation;contamination;environmental monitoring;persistent organic pollutant;Health risks;water pollutant;spatial distribution;concentration (composition);alkanesulfonic acid;Meats;risk assessment;Risk assessment;Environmental matrixes;human;article;Pacific Ocean;metabolism;health hazard;clinical article;analysis;health risk;Health risk assessment;Health;sea food;Seafood;swimming;dry weight;Aquatic Organisms;aquatic species;seafood;city;Water Pollutants;Human health risk assessment;Chemical;Portunus trituberculatus;Yellow Sea;Yellow sea;Biohazards;Bioaccumulation potential;Pampus argenteus;Portunidae,NA,NA

PFASs concentrations above the limit of quantification, LOQ (0.6 ng/l) were detected in 20.9% of the samples from Greece. Total PFAS concentrations ranged between <LOQ and 5.9 ng/l, with the highest concentrations noted for the three Aegean islands Mykonos, Kalymnos and Syros and for the town Tripoli in the Peloponnese. In the Dutch situation, total PFASs concentrations above the LOQ were detected in 48.6% of the samples, varying from <LOQ to 54 ng/l. The highest concentrations were detected around Amsterdam (including Schiphol airport) and more generally, PFASs were detected in the drinking water from the western part of the Netherlands. This seems attributable to the source, which is purified surface water in this area. Short-chain PFASs and especially perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) were detected most frequently, whereas long-chain PFASs (C > 8) were only rarely detected. In the drinking water samples from the eastern part of the Netherlands, where drinking water is sourced from groundwater reservoirs, no PFASs were detected. This demonstrates that exposure to PFASs through drinking water in the Netherlands is dependent on the source. Additionally, five samples of bottled water from each country were analysed in the current study, with all of them originating from ground wells.

Fish samples was collected, codded and dried via freeze-dried and homogenised, and poly/perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were extracted by ultrasonic assisted ion pair liquid-liquid extraction. The extractant was then cleaned up with solid phase extraction with different absorbents. To avoid carry-over, contamination/losing target analytes during SPE step, a simple one-step centrifugal SPE was used. All parameters of the analytical method such as linearity range, stability of analytical signal, LOD, and LOQ of the analytical method have been investigated and presented. Limit of quantification of the method was from 0.04 µg kg−1 to 0.45 µg kg−1 for the wet weight sample. Matrix effect was investigated and eliminated by solid phase extraction. Overall recovery of the PFASs in range of 44%−132% was achieved. Excellent repeatability of analytical signal in both short-term and long-term were below 9.0% and 16%, respectively. The analytical method has been validated by using certified reference material, NIST 1947. The validated analytical method was then used for analysis of PFASs in edible fish samples that collected in several coastal sites in Vietnam. The results showed that the main compounds in marine fish samples were perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and 2:6-FT.

Both chemicals are worldwide contaminants with wide ranging biological effects and have been identified in relatively high concentrations in apex level marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins. The primary objective of this study was to determine if exposure to MeHg or PFOS would alter the gene expression in primary bottlenose dolphin epidermal cell cultures. Primary skin cells were isolated and cultured from skin samples collected from wild bottlenose dolphins. The cells were subsequently exposed to 13 ppm PFOS or 1 ppm MeHg and changes in gene expression were analyzed by suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR). 116 genes were positively identified in the dolphin skin cells by SSH. Of these, 16 total genes were analyzed by QPCR (9 and 11 genes following PFOS or MeHg exposure, respectively, with four overlapping genes). Results indicate MeHg significantly alters gene expression patterns following 24 h exposure, but has no measurable effect after only 1 h. PFOS exposure, however, caused significant alterations following both 1 and 25 h. Overall, the changes in gene expression observed indicate these concentrations of MeHg and PFOS significantly alter normal gene expression patterns. The changes in gene expression following exposure to these contaminants not only indicate a cellular stress response, but also decreased cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation and reduced protein translation. Alterations in normal cellular biology, like those observed, may lead to changes in health in marine mammals exposed to contaminants; however, this warrants further investigation.

Sediments of the Spittelwasser creek are highly polluted with organic compounds and heavy metals due to the discharge of untreated waste waters from the industrial region of Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany over the course of more than one century. However, relatively few data have been published about the chloroorganic contamination of the sediment. This paper reports on the content of different (chloro)organic compounds with special emphasis on polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F), and chlorobenzenes. Existing concepts for the remediation of Spittelwasser sediment include the investigation of natural attenuation processes, which largely depend on the presence of an intact microbial food web. In order to gain more insight in terms of biological activity, we analyzed the capacity of sediment microflora to degrade organic matter by measuring the activities of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes involved in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur. Furthermore, the detection of physiologically active bacteria in the sediment, particularly of those known for their capability to reductively dehalogenate organochlorine compounds, illustrates the potential for intrinsic bioremediation processes. Methods. PCDD/F and chlorobenzenes were analyzed by gas chromatography(GC)/mass spectrometry and GC/flame ionization detection, respectively. The activities of hydrolytic enzymes were determined from freshly sampled sediment layers using 4methylumbelliferyl (MUF) or 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-conjugated model compounds and kinetic fluorescence measurements. Physiologically active bacteria from different sediment layers were microscopically visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Specific bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. Results and Discussion. The PCDD/F congener profile was dominated by dibenzofurans. In addition, the presence of specific tetra and pentachlorinated dibenzofurans supported the assumption that extensive magnesium production was one possible source for the high contamination. A range of other chloroorganic compounds, including several isomers of chlorobenzenes, hexachlorocyclohexane and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), was present in the sediment. Activities of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes showed a strong decrease in those sediment layers that were characterized by high contents of absorbable organic halogen (AOX), indicating disturbed organic matter decay. Interestingly, an abnormal increase of cellulolytic enzyme activities below the organochlorine-rich layers was observed, possibly caused by residual cellulose from discharges of sulfite pulping wastes. FISH revealed physiologically active bacteria in most sediment layers from the surface down to the depth of about 60 cm, including members of Desulfito bacterium (D.) and Sulfurospirillum. The presence of D. dehalogenans was confirmed by its partial 16S rRNA gene sequence. Conclusions. Results of chemical sediment analyses demonstrated high loads of organochlorine compounds, particularly of PCDD/F. Several years after stopping the waste water discharge to Spittelwasser creek, this sediment remains a main source for pollution of the downstream river system by way of the ongoing mobilization of sediment during high floods. As indicated by our enzyme activity measurements, the decomposition potential for organic matter is low in organochlorine-rich sediment layers. In contrast, the comparably higher enzyme activities in less organochlorine-polluted sediment layers as well as the presence of physiologically active bacteria suggest a considerable potential for natural attenuation. Recommendations and Perspectives. From our data we strongly recommend to explore the degradative capacity of sediment microorganisms and the limits for in situ activity towards specific sediment pollutants in more detail. This will give a sound basis for the integration of bioremediation approaches into general concepts to reduce the risk that permanently radiates from this highly contaminated sediment.",NA,10.1065/espr2006.03.298,character(0),NA,NA

In this study, the occurrence of eight widely used organic UV filters was analysed in five different primary marine consumers from three beaches on the Gran Canaria Island (Spain) collected for 4 months. For that, a new method, based on microwave-assisted extraction and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in tandem, was optimized and validate. The developed method presented detection limits between 0.7 ng.(-1) dry weight (dw) and 7.1 ng(-1) dw and intraday and interday precision with ranges from 0.2 % to 9.9 % and from 1.9 % to 12.4 %, respectively. The method was applied to 20 samples comprising five different types of organisms. All the analysed samples revealed the presence of organic UV filters, in all samples at least one analyte was determined. The highest detection frequency corresponded to butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM) (55 %), while octocrylene (OC) was found at the highest concentration (1,735 ng.(-1) dw) in the sea hare Aplysia dactylomela. At the same time, a preliminary bioconcentration and biomagnification assessment was made for the UV filters found in the studied marine organisms.

The ecological impacts associated with their presence are still poorly understood, however, these contaminants are extremely persistent. Although plastic in the environment can concentrate pollutants, factors such as the type of plastic and duration of environmental exposure as it relates to the degree of adsorption have received far less attention. To address these knowledge gaps, experiments were carried out that examined the interactions of PFAS and microplastics in the field and in a controlled environment. For field experiments, we measured the abundance of PFAS on different polymer types of microplastics that were deployed in a lake for 1 month and 3 months. Based on these results, a controlled experiment was conducted to assess the adsorption properties of microplastics in the absence of associated inorganic and organic matter. The adsorption of PFAS was much greater on the field-incubated plastic than what was observed in the laboratory with plastic and water alone, 24 to 259 times versus one-seventh to one-fourth times background levels. These results suggest that adsorption of PFAS by microplastics is greatly enhanced by the presence of inorganic and/or organic matter associated with these materials in the environment, and could present an environmental hazard for aquatic biota. © 2021 by the authors.
