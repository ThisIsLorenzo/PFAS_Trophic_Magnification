Descriptive statistics and correlations between PFASs were evaluated through the use of specific statistical treatments to handle left-censored data (""non-detects""). PFASs were ubiquitous in these samples and detection frequencies as high as 79% for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and 65% for perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) were reported in surface waters. Sigma PFASs was in the range <LOD-77 ng L-1 (median =1.8 ng L-1) in surface waters and <LOD-638 ng L-1 (median=0.56 ng L-1) in groundwater. PFOS and PFOA dominated PFAS composition profiles in surface water, while shorter-chain compounds prevailed in groundwater, highlighting their higher transfer potential through infiltration processes and the possible influence of precursors. Elevated levels of 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTSA) and short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates were found in groundwater near several industrial facilities such as oil refineries or electricity power plants. This may be related to the existence of firefighting operations involving the use of aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs) that contain precursors to such compounds. These findings would also tend to confirm recent trends regarding the increasing proportion of C-4- or C-6-based perfluoroalkyl acids, their precursors, or even shorter-chain congeners at PFAS hot spots.

A stable isotope dilution assay (SIDA) with d(7)-gamma-decalactone as internal standard was used for quantitative analysis of pineapple lactones that was performed at three progressing post-harvest stages of fully ripe air-freighted and green-ripe sea-freighted fruits, covering the relevant shelf-life of the fruits. Fresh pineapples harvested at full maturity were characterised by gamma-C6 of high enantiomeric purity remaining stable during the whole post-harvest period. In contrast, the enantiomeric purity of gamma-C6 significantly decreased during post-harvest storage of sea-freighted pineapples. The biogenetical background and the potential of chirospecific analysis of lactones for authentication and quality evaluation of fresh pineapple fruits are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We collected and analysed 64 eggs belonging to ten species of six feeding guilds, and compared organic chlorinated pesticide (OCP), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), and brominated flame retardants (BFR) residue concentrations and compositions. The eggs were collected in the Gauteng and the northern part of the Free Sate provinces of South Africa, one of the largest economic hubs in Africa. White-breasted Cormorant and African Darter eggs (at the highest trophic level as large aquatic predators) had the highest sigma OCP and sigma PCB concentrations, and Cape Sparrow and Southern Masked Weaver (granivores) eggs had the lowest concentrations, corresponding to the lowest trophic level in our collection. The highest percentage p,p'-DDT were in eggs of the terrestrial insectivore Crowned Lapwing (24%) and the scavenging African Sacred Ibis (17%), and the lowest in African Darter (1.0%) and White-breasted Cormorant (0.9%) eggs, suggesting that recency of DDT releases in a region cannot be gauged by this metric. African Sacred Ibis and Southern Masked Weaver eggs had the highest sigma BFR concentrations, with Crowned Lapwing, Cattle Egret, and White-breasted Cormorant eggs the least. Based on feeding guilds, the mean sigma POP concentrations increased from granivore, aquatic omnivore, scavenger, terrestrial insectivore, small aquatic predator, to large aquatic predator. Mean sigma POP concentrations in eggs increased from terrestrial, to wetland, to aquatic habitat birds. Interesting patterns were observed with multivariate analyses. There were no significant regressions between egg size and any summed POP classes. sigma BFR concentrations were not correlated with sigma OCPs or sigma PCBs. Eggshell thinning of African Darter eggs was associated with p,p'-DDE and sigma PCB suggesting risk. Other metrics also suggest risk. Therefore, different species of terrestrial and aquatic birds from the same area acquire and deposit POPs in different proportions and quantities in their eggs. Trophic levels and habitat explain the overall patterns, but detailed differences were found, some of which we are unable to explain. Based on POPs residues in terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic bird eggs, different POPs classes behave differently in a shared large inland industrial area, complicating deductions about POPs and associated risks based on one or few species.",NA,10.1007/s00244-021-00882-8,Ovum,NA,NA

Frequent use of PFAS in textiles means that both active and closed textile mills require evaluation as PFAS sources. We deployed passive samplers at seven sites in an urban river and estuary adjacent to textile mills in Southern Rhode Island (USA) over 12 months. We estimated monthly mass flows (g month-1) of perfluorohexanoic acid (45 ± 56) and perfluorooctanoic acid (30 ± 45) from the upstream river influenced by an active mill. Average mass flows were 73-155% higher downstream, where historical textile waste lagoons contributed long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids. Mass flows of perfluorononanoic acid increased from 7.5 to 21 g month-1 between the upstream and downstream portions of the rivers. Distinct grouping of the two main PFAS sources, active textile mills and historical waste lagoons, was identified using principal component analysis. Neither suspect screening nor extractable organofluorine analysis revealed that measurable PFASs were missing beyond the targeted compounds. This research demonstrates that both closed and active textile mills are important ongoing PFAS sources to freshwater and marine regions and should be further evaluated as a source category. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acsestwater.3c00439,PFAS;PFCA;passive sampling;textile mills;waste lagoons,NA,NA

PFCs become emerging chemicals of concern and two of them, namely perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF) were listed as “restricted use” (Annex B) under the Stockholm Convention in May 2009. PFCs have an anionic functional group and nonpolar perfluoroalkyl chain. This moiety allows them to repel both water and oil, and accounts for their surfaces tension/leveling properties. Additionally, the high-energy carbon-fluorine bond accounts for the chemical and physical stability of these compounds. PFOS and perflurooctanoate (PFOA), having an eight carbon, were the two most well-known PFCs. PFCs have been manufactured and used as surfactant processing aids in the production of fluoropolymers, coatings for clothing, fabrics, upholstery and carpets, in paper products approved for food contact, and in aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) for the past six decades [1]. PFCs are ubiquitous in the environment, and different governmental agencies have taken corresponding actions to regulate these compounds. The use of PFOS is regulated in the United States; further regulations of PFOS and related compounds have been implemented in the EU (Directive 76/769) from December 2007 in Europe, while the remaining permitted uses will be phased out by 2011 (OJ Directive 2006/122/ECOF). In Japan, according to the Chemical Substance Control Law, PFOS and POSF were listed as class I hazardous chemicals in April 2010. To a certain extent, they were classified as one of the contaminants, similar to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which can pose the highest risks to human. On the other hand, PFOA was classified as a Class II chemical on the watch list in 2002. PFOA-related chemicals such as perfluorododecanoic acid, perfluorotridecanoic acid, perfluorotetradecanoic acid, perfluoropentadecanoic acid, and perfluorohexadecanoic acid were classified as Class I chemicals on the watch list in 2008. Concern about fluorinated organic compounds, particularly PFCs, has been growing since the late 1990s because of the ubiquitous occurrence of PFCs in the environment, especially since they were found in biota (i.e., polar bear) from remote arctic regions where no PFC-related production facilities existed [1-7]. © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,NA,⛔ No DOI found;character(0),NA,NA

These studies were conducted to improve dosing efficacy and safety for OTC use in treating shrimp. Oxytetracycline is available commercially for feed preparation as a premix of two different forms of the parent drug, the dihydrate form (OXTC) and the monoalkyl (C8-18) trimethyl quaternary salt form (TMF). Both pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties were studied under conditions simulating a marine environment. Physicochemical properties studied were solubility and short-term stability of the premixes and dissolution following incorporation of the premix into feed. The oral bioavailability of OTC from feed containing either form of OTC was evaluated and compared in shrimp following single and multiple dosing. Hemolymph levels of OTC at predetermined time intervals after dosing were measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The hemolymph OTC levels were fitted to appropriate pharmacokinetic models to determine parameters as is typically done in pharmacokinetic evaluations. OTC was more than twice as soluble from OXTC than from the TMF premix. After being pelleted with feed, dissolution studies showed nearly identical release profiles for the two OTC forms. It appears that the medicated feed acts like a matrix resulting in a controlled release dosage form for OTC with 100% release requiring about 24 It. The short-term stability study indicated that OTC from the TMF premix was more stable than OXTC in seawater under ambient conditions. While this might improve bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy, it will lengthen its residence time in the environment if released with consequent increased environmental risk. Hemolymph OTC concentration versus time profiles following single dose oral administration were well described by a triexponential equation suggesting a two compartment pharmacokinetic model. OTC was well absorbed from both salt forms when orally administered; bioavailability was better than reported in the literature for finfish. To evaluate bioequivalency, the rate and extent of absorption were compared for the two forms of OTC. The maximum hemolymph concentration (C-max) and time to achieve the maximum (t(max)) were not significantly different for the two forms, but the apparent bioavailability (F) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was found to be statistically greater for the OXTC form. In both cases, peak concentrations were delayed, suggesting a unique mechanism for absorption in shrimp. While single dose studies with individual shrimp suggested that OXTC was the preferred form of OTC, multiple dose studies with multiple shrimp showed that practically there is little difference in therapeutic efficacy or depuration times between the two forms of OTC. Overall, either form of OTC can be useful for the, aquaculturing of shrimp; it appears that OTC can be used safely in a product for human consumption following a reasonably short withdrawal period.

Samples from ptarmigan (West Greenland), reindeer (southwest-Greenland), muskox (East Greenland), and land-locked Arctic char from southwest Greenland and the Faroe Islands were analyzed. In addition, PFASs levels in land-locked brown trout from Faroese lakes are reported. Of the 17 PFASs analyzed in the samples the following compounds were detected: PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTrA, and PFTeA.PFNA was the compound detected in most samples and in all species. However, the compound detected at highest concentration was dependent on species, with overall highest concentrations of PFTrA and PFUnA being detected in trout liver from Lake á Mýranar (Faroe Islands). In muskox, the PFAS occurring at highest concentrations was PFDA, which was among the PFAS detected at lowest concentrations in freshwater fish, and was only detected in one individual ptarmigan. The concentration of PFOS, PFDoA and PFTrA in Arctic char from Greenland and Faroe Islands were similar, whereas the concentration of PFNA, PFDA and PFUnA were higher in Arctic char than those from Greenland. The opposite was observed for PFTeA. The PFASs occurring at highest concentrations in trout were PFTrA and PFUnA. Arctic char from Lake á Mýranar had much lower concentrations of PFTrA and PFUnA than in trout from the lakes analyzed, but a higher concentration of PFTeA than trout from the same lake.

The most important common structural feature of the category members examined here is the presence of a predominantly linear aliphatic hydrocarbon chain with a polar sulfate or sulfonate group, neutralized with a counter-ion. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain (with a length between C<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>18</sub>) and the polar sulfate or sulfonate groups confer surfactant properties and enable the commercial use of these substances as anionic surfactants. The close structural similarities lead to physico-chemical properties and environmental fate characteristics which follow a regular pattern and justify the applied read-across within a category approach. Common physical and/or biological properties result in structurally similar breakdown products and are, together with the surfactant properties, responsible for similar environmental behavior. The structural similarities result in the same mode of ecotoxic action. Within each of the three sub-categories of ANS the most important parameter influencing ecotoxicity is the varying length of the alkyl chain. Although the counter-ion may also influence the physico-chemical properties, there is no indication that it significantly affects chemical reactivity, environmental fate and behavior or ecotoxicity of these chemicals. Deduced from physico-chemical and surfactancy properties, the main target compartment for the substances of the ANS category is the hydrosphere. They are quantitatively removed in waste water treatment plants, mainly by biodegradation. Quantitative removal in biological treatment plants is reflected by low AS concentrations measured in effluents of waste water treatment plants (mostly below 10μg/L). In addition, bioaccumulation of ANS does not exceed regulatory triggers based upon experimental data. A considerable number of reliable aquatic toxicity data for the whole ANS category are available, including chronic and subchronic data for species of all trophic levels. Based upon the highest quality data in hand, there appears to be no singularly most sensitive trophic level in tests on the toxicity of alkyl sulfates, with a large degree of overlap among algae, invertebrates and fish. Algae proved to be more variable in sensitivity to alkyl sulfate exposure compared to fish and daphnia. The key study for the aquatic hazard assessment is a chronic test on Ceriodaphnia dubia, which covers a range of the alkyl chain length from C<sub>12</sub> to C<sub>18</sub>. A parabolic response was observed, with the C<sub>14</sub> chain length being the most toxic (7d-NOEC=0.045mg/L). Responses of aquatic communities to C<sub>12</sub> AS and C<sub>14–15</sub> AS have been studied in high quality stream mesocosm studies containing a broad range of species and ecological interactions. These studies are regarded as a better approximation to reality when extrapolating to the environment. The 56-d chronic NOEC for C<sub>12</sub> AS and C<sub>14–15</sub> AS were 0.224 and 0.106mg/L, respectively, based on integrated assessments of periphyton (algal, bacterial and protozoan) and invertebrate communities. Taking into account the rapid biodegradation of the ANS compounds as well as the low concentrations measured in different environmental compartments, this category of surfactants is of low concern for the environment.",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.04.015,Pollution;Surface-Active Agents;Surface active agents;Toxicity testing;Development;Hazardous substances;Organisation for Economic Co-operation &amp;Physical &amp;Sulfonates;theoretical chemistry,NA,NA

The bioaccumulation factors of PFASs by D. magna decreased linearly with the increase of Ca2+ and Na+ concentrations. The inhibition effect of Ca2+ was stronger than that of Na+, and the decreasing percentages of the body burden of PFASs in D. magna caused by the increment of 1mmolL(-1) Ca2+ and 1mmolL(-1) Na+ were 41% to approximately 48% and 2% to approximately 5%, respectively, in the presence of soy peptone. The partition coefficients (K-p) of PFASs between protein and water increased with rising Ca2+ and Na+ concentrations. The elevated K-p values led to the reduced concentrations of freely dissolved PFASs. This resulted in a decrease of PFAS bioaccumulation in D. magna, and the body burden of each PFAS was positively correlated with its freely dissolved concentration in water. The present study suggests that cations should be considered in the assessment of bioavailability and risk of PFASs in natural waters containing proteinaceous compounds.

This thesis directly addresses this knowledge gap by aiming to investigate the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and non-essential heavy metals in the Australian sea lion (N. cinerea), Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus), and the long-nosed fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri), and the impact they have on health. PFAS concentrations were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in Australian fur seals compared to Australian sea lion pups, except for perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), which exhibited greater concentrations in Australian sea lions. These findings highlight species-specific differences in PFAS profiles and magnitude of concentrations across colony locations. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in liver concentrations of POPs were observed between Australian sea lions and Australian fur seals. Associations were also found between greater POPs concentrations and mortality groups (infectious disease/trauma and starvation) in Australian sea lion pups. Lastly, temporal differences in mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) concentrations were identified in Australian sea lion pups across breeding seasons, exceeding toxic thresholds for humans and marine mammals. Lower selenium (Se) levels and Se:Hg ratios in N. cinerea compared to sympatric species indicate a concerning vulnerability to mercury toxicity in Australian sea lion pups. The high concentrations of toxicants identified in Australian pinnipeds and the identification of association with health, highlights the imperative to have ongoing monitoring in Australian sentinel marine mammals.",NA,NA,Australia;health;Pinniped;sentinel;toxicant,NA,NA

Results indicate that groundwater can be separated into three distinct geochemical zones based on location within the flow system and proximity to surface water, and these zones can be used to infer sources of recharge and groundwater movement through the aquifer. Rare-earth-element concentrations and detections of wastewater-indicator compounds indicate the presence of effluent from wastewater-treatment plants in both groundwater and surface water. Effluent presence in groundwater indicates that streams in the area lose to groundwater in some seasons and are a source of focused groundwater recharge. Distributions of pharmaceuticals and wastewater-indicator compounds also inform an understanding of groundwater-surface-water interactions. Noble-gas isotopes corroborate rare-earth-element data in indicating geochemical evolution within the aquifer from recharge area to discharge area and qualitatively indicate variable groundwater-residence times and mixing with pre-modern groundwater. Quantitative groundwater-residence times calculated from H-3/He-3, SF6, and lumped-parameter modeling generally are less than 20 years, but the presence of mixing with older groundwater of an unknown age is also indicated at selected locations. Future investigations would benefit by including groundwater-age tracers suited to quantification of mixing for both young (years to decades) and old (centuries and millennia) groundwater.

Although several reports have reviewed PBDE contamination in general, none have focused specifically on birds. Birds have long been recognized as invaluable monitoring species for organohalogen contamination. This review summarizes most available PBDE data in birds and emphasizes several specific aspects, i.e., inter-regional differences in PBDE contamination, the extent of BDE-209 contamination, differences in congener composition patterns between piscivorous and terrestrial-feeding birds, trophic biomagnification and temporal changes in PBDE contamination. A meta-analysis of PBDE congener profiles reveals distinctly different patterns between birds utilizing terrestrial and aquatic food webs. Terrestrial-feeding birds appear to exhibit heightened Deca-BDE contamination. Inter-regional comparisons reveal elevated PBDE burdens in North American aquatic birds compared to those from the rest of the world, likely related to greater Penta-BDE demand there. Examination of North American and Chinese terrestrial birds also exhibited some of the highest BDE-209 concentrations ever reported in wildlife, and suggested that urban environments in general and some commercial activities (e.g., electronic recycling) may increase exposure of wildlife and humans to Deca-BDE. Summaries of temporal trend studies suggest that varying usage histories and regulations have influenced PBDE contamination patterns at different regions. As a consequence of continued usage of Deca-BDE around the world, significant increases in BDE-209 burdens have been observed in both North American and European birds. Examination of both wild and laboratory-exposed birds also indicated potential degradation of BDE-209 to less brominated, but more bioavailable/toxic congeners. Therefore, it would be wise to reduce releases of Deca-BDE, the only PBDE formulation remaining in production, to the environment.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2010.05.013,Europe;Organohalogen compounds;Bioavailability;Biodegradation;Food chains;the environment;Bird conservation;Fireproofing agents;Industrial contamination;Polybrominated diphenyl ethers &amp;Ethers;Ether,NA,NA

Plastic debris also act as a vector of many contaminants, herein depending on type, size, shape and chemical properties, possibly intensifying their effects on marine organisms. This study aimed to assess the accumulation and potential toxicity of different sizes of microplastics with and without adsorbed perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in the clam Scrobicularia plana. Clams were exposed to low-density polyethylene microplastics (1 mg L−1) of two different sizes (4–6 and 20–25 μm) virgin and contaminated with PFOS (55.7 ± 5.3 and 46.1 ± 2.9 μg g−1 respectively) over 14 days. Microplastic ingestion, PFOS accumulation and filtration rate were determined along with a multi biomarker approach to assess the biological effects of microplastics ingestion. Biomarkers include oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases), biotransformation enzymes (glutathione-S-transferases activity), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity), oxidative damage and apoptosis. Microplastics ingestion and PFOS accumulation was microplastic size dependent but not PFOS dependent and filtration rate was reduced at the end of the exposure. Reactive oxygen species in gills and digestive gland were generated as a result of exposure to both types of microplastics, confirming the disturbance of the antioxidant system. Larger virgin microparticles lead to stronger impacts, when compared to smaller ones which was also supported by the Integrated Biomarker Responses index calculated for both tissues. An anti-apoptotic response was detected in digestive glands under exposure to any of the MPs treatments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.105249,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Peptides;animal;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;Marine biology;Marine pollution;nonhuman;controlled study;bioaccumulation;biological marker;biomarker;animal tissue;water pollutant;Biomarkers;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;oxidative stress;toxicity;Toxicity;adsorption;ecotoxicology;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;water contamination;neurotoxicity;chemical parameters;organofluorine;plastic;Plastics;analysis;catalase;glutathione transferase;biotransformation;enzyme activity;Microplastic;Microplastics;microplastic;microplastic pollution;bivalve;Bivalvia;glutathione peroxidase;superoxide dismutase;polymer;apoptosis;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid;reactive oxygen metabolite;Shellfish;clam;Molluscs;Enzymes;Water Pollutants;Chemical;ingestion;polyethylene;Polyethylene;gill;filtration;Glutathione S-transferases;Cell death;Integrated biomarker response;acetylcholinesterase;Digestive system;mollusc;Multi-biomarker approaches;exocrine gland;Polyethylenes;Glutathione peroxidase;Acetylcholinesterase activity;Aliphatic compounds;Biotransformation enzymes;Ecotoxicological effects;Scrobicularia plana;Sulfones;Sulfonic Acids,NA,NA

Their presence has already been detected in several aquatic ecosystems worldwide and their effects on non-target organisms justify the growing concern of both the public and regulatory authorities. These emerging pollutants do not occur as isolated compounds but rather as multi-component mixtures, which may lead to increased adverse effects compared to individual compounds. Freshwater and marine algae seem particularly sensitive to pharmaceuticals, including antidepressants. Studies assessing the toxicity of antidepressant mixture to algae focused mainly on binary mixtures of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In the present experiment, the freshwater algae Raphidocelis subcapitata (formerly known as Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and the marine diatom Skeletonema marinoi were exposed to equitoxic mixtures of 9 antidepressants (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, amitriptyline, and citalopram) at different concentrations. The growth inhibition was measured. Results showed that the toxicity of this mixture was higher than the effects of each individual component, highlighting simple additivity or synergistic effects, whereas tested concentrations were below the 10% inhibition concentration (IC10) of each compound. Moreover, the QSAR analysis highlighted that antidepressants would act through narcosis (non-specific mode of action) towards the two species of algae. However, more specific effects can be observed by differentiating compounds with a primary/secondary amine from those with a tertiary amine. These mixture effects on algal species have to be assessed, especially since any impacts on phytoplankton could ultimately impact higher trophic levels (less food, secondary poisoning).",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.01.015,Amination;Amines;Antidepressive Agents,NA,NA

The LC50 values of Cu(II) decreased with the increasing pH and the addition of PFOS. After each exposure, increasing bioaccumulation of Cu(II) in L. hoffmeisteri was observed in the combined exposure treatments, whereas the bioaccumulation of PFOS decreased. Moreover, the activity of superoxide dismutase, the level of glutathione, and the content of malondialdehyde were significantly altered after these exposures, possibly indicating that the bioaccumulation of Cu(II) and PFOS caused adverse effects on antioxidant defenses of L. hoffmeisteri.

PFOS is known to cause developmental effects in fish. The main effect of PFOS in zebrafish larvae is an uninflated swim bladder. As no previous studies have focused on the effect of PFOS on zebrafish swim bladder inflation, the exact mechanisms leading to this effect are currently unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the exposure windows during early zebrafish development that are sensitive to PFOS exposure and result in impaired swim bladder inflation in order to specify the mechanisms by which this effect might be caused. Seven different time windows of exposure (1-48, 1-72, 1-120, 1-144, 48-144, 72-144, 120-144h post fertilization (hpf)) were tested based on the different developmental stages of the swim bladder. These seven time windows were tested for four concentrations corresponding to the EC-values of 1, 10, 80 and 95% impaired swim bladder inflation (EC1=0.70mgL-1, EC10=1.14mgL-1, EC80=3.07mgL-1 and EC95=4.28mgL-1). At 6 days post fertilization, effects on survival, hatching, swim bladder inflation and size, larval length and swimming performance were assessed. For 0.70mgL-1, no significant effects were found for the tested parameters while 1.14mgL-1 resulted in a reduction of larval length. For 3.07 and 4.28mgL-1, the number of larvae affected and the severity of effects caused by PFOS were dependent on the time window of exposure. Exposure for 3 days or more resulted in significant reductions of swim bladder size, larval length and swimming speed with increasing severity of effects when the duration of exposure was longer, suggesting a possible effect of accumulated dose. Larvae that were only exposed early (1-48hpf) or late (120-144hpf) during development showed no effects on the studied endpoints. The results demonstrate that PFOS does not affect the budding phase, and does not cause deflation of already inflated swim bladders. PFOS clearly affects processes that take place during the inflation phase and might also have an effect on the formation of the tissue layers forming the swim bladder. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.10.017,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Animals;Article;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;controlled study;bioaccumulation;pollutant;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);adult;alkanesulfonic acid;surfactant;toxicity;developmental toxicity;embryo;hatching;zebra fish;LC50;physiology;Zebrafish;survival rate;cyprinid;Danio rerio;swimming;chemically induced;drug effects;energy expenditure;concentration response;Time Factors;time;Water Pollutants;fertilization;long term exposure;Chemical;larva;Larva;body size;larval development;Zebrafish larvae;swim bladder;swimming behavior;Swimming;Body Size;air sac;Air Sacs;bladder malformation;Early development;posterior swim bladder chamber uninflation;Spinal Curvatures;spine;Spine;spine disease;Swim bladder;Swimming performance,NA,NA

Despite frequent and relatively high concentrations of OCs in eaglets, little is understood about potential biological effects associated with exposure. We screened an existing database of OC concentrations in eaglet plasma collected from the Midwestern United States against bioactivity information from the ToxCast database. ToxCast bioactivity information consists of concentrations expected to elicit responses across a range of biological space (e.g. cellular, developmental, etc.) obtained from a series of high throughput assays. We calculated exposure—activity ratios (EAR) by calculating the ratio of plasma concentrations to concentrations available in ToxCast. Bioactivity data were not available for all detected OCs. Therefore, our analysis provides estimates of potential bioactivity for 19 of the detected OCs in eaglet plasma. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) EAR values were consistently the highest among all study areas. Maximum EAR values were ≥1 for PFOS, perfluorononanoic acid, and bisphenol A in 99.7, 0.53 and 0.26% of samples, indicating that some plasma concentrations were greater than what may be expected to elicit biological responses. About 125 gene targets, indicative of specific biological pathways, were identified as potentially being affected. Inhibition of several CYP genes, involved in xenobiotic metabolism, were most consistently identified. Other identified biological responses have potential implications for motor coordination, cardiac functions, behavior, and blood circulation. However, it is unclear what these results mean for bald eagles, given that ToxCast data are generated using mammalian-based endpoints. Despite uncertainties and limitations, this method of screening environmental data can be useful for informing future monitoring or research focused on understanding the occurrence and effects of OCs in bald eagles and other similarly-positioned trophic species. Comparison of organic contaminant concentrations in bald eaglet plasma to bioactivity data from in-vitro bioassays indicates that PFOS, CYP-related endpoints, and sites near urban areas should be prioritized for future monitoring focused on understanding the effects of organic contaminant exposure in bald eagles. © 2018",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2018.10.093,Article;United States;Genes;nonhuman;controlled study;nestling;plasma;Plasma;raptor;contamination;eagle;Mammals;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);gene;Contamination;bioassay;Perfluorononanoic acids;Haliaeetus leucocephalus;Plasma concentration;organic pollutant;gene targeting;biological activity;Mammalia;circulation;Plasmas;Pollution detection;behaviorism;bioactivity;Bioactivity;Cardiovascular system;CYP gene;future prospect;heart function;High-throughput assays;Impurities;In-vitro bioactivity;Midwest;monitoring;motor coordination;Perfluorinated chemicals;ToxCast;Urban growth;xenobiotic metabolism;Xenobiotic metabolism;4;4' isopropylidenediphenol;Biological Assay;Alopecia,NA,NA

Accumulating evidence has shown that PFOS breaks through different biological barriers resulting in cardiac toxicity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid without potential adverse cardiotoxicity and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that reduce multiorgan damage and dysfunction. For these reasons, the aim of this study was to research how PFOS caused heart injury and whether CBD could attenuate PFOS-induced heart injury. Mice were fed PFOS (5 mg/kg) and/or CBD (10 mg/kg) in vivo. In vitro, H9C2 cells were intervened with PFOS (200 μM) and/or CBD (10 μM). After PFOS exposure, oxidative stress levels and the mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis-related markers increased distinctly, accompanied by mitochondrial dynamic imbalance and energy metabolism disorders in mouse heart and H9C2 cells. Moreover, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and Hoechst 33258 staining signaled that the number of apoptotic cells increased after exposure to PFOS. Noteworthy, CBD simultaneous treatment alleviated a series of damages caused by PFOS-mediated oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated that CBD could alleviate PFOS-induced mitochondrial dynamics imbalance and energy metabolism disorder causing cardiomyocyte apoptosis by improving the antioxidant capacity, suggesting that CBD may represent a novel cardioprotective strategy against PFOS-induced cardiotoxicity.

Moreover, the impact of PFCs on neuronal survival, activity, and regulation within the brain remains unclear. Additionally, the mechanisms through which PFCs induce neuronal toxicity are not well-understood because of the paucity of data. This study elucidates that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) exert differential effects on the survival and activity of primary cortical neurons. Although PFOA triggers apoptosis in cortical neurons, PFHpA does not exhibit this effect. Instead, PFHpA modifies dendritic spine morphogenesis and synapse formation in primary cortical neuronal cultures, additionally enhancing neural activity and synaptic transmission. This research uncovers a novel mechanism through which PFCs (PFHpA and PFOA) cause distinct alterations in dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic activity, shedding light on the molecular basis for the atypical behaviors noted following PFC exposure.

PFAS accumulation in gammarids occurred via the trophic and respiratory pathways, in proportions varying with the carbon chain length and the terminal moiety. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.04.006,"Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Sulfur compounds;Carboxylic Acids;Sulfonic Acids;Kinetics;Environmental Exposure;France;animal;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;carbon;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;perfluoro compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;sulfonic acid derivative;Perfluorinated compounds;carboxylic acid;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;perfluorononanoic acid;metabolism;sediment;analysis;sulfonamide;organic compound;Geologic Sediments;Sediments;biological uptake;fresh water;sediment pollution;perfluorooctane;freshwater environment;reaction kinetics;steady state;kinetics;Fresh Water;Crustacea;Chain length;benthos;Sediment;Amphipoda;fluorotelomer sulfonic acid;Rhone River;amphipod;Gammarus;Clearance;clearance rate;n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid;n methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid;accumulation index;BSAF;Exposure route;Gammaridae;Gammarus spp.;perfluorinated alkyl compound;perflurooctane sulfonamide;Uptake rate;RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly I-C;Poly A-U",NA,NA

However, diversity and function of marine chloroethene-dechlorinating microorganisms are largely unknown. Here, we have studied the activity and composition of a tidal flat sediment bacterial and archaeal community from the North Sea exposed to low concentrations of PCE. After 2 weeks of incubation, PCE was rapidly dechlorinated via trichloroethene to dichloroethene (DCE). Unexpectedly, these microcosms produced 3.5-fold more trans-DCE than cis-DCE. The actively dechlorinating microbial populations were traced by stable isotope probing of rRNA with C-13-labelled acetate for 4 days. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting and clone libraries of isotopically enriched, 'heavy' C-13-labelled bacterial 16S rRNA revealed the populations potentially involved in reductive dechlorination. Major clone groups belonged to the Proteobacteria (50.0%; 22.4% delta-, 12.1% gamma-, 6.9% alpha-, 6.9% beta- and 1.7% epsilon-subgroup) and Chloroflexi (29.3%). Populations represented by the two dominant terminal restriction fragments were affiliated with the Dehalococcoidetes (subphylum II of the Chloroflexi), and were exclusively detected in the heavy fraction of the PCE-dechlorinating incubation. The phylogenetically novel, larger population, designated Tidal Flat Chloroflexi Cluster, was closely related to the recently discovered PCE-dechlorinating Lahn Cluster bacteria from anoxic river sediment but more distantly related to canonical Dehalococcoides spp. (92-94% sequence identity). The second population was closely related to 'Dehalobium chlorocoercia DF-1'. Both populations appear to be responsible for reductive dechlorination of highly chlorinated ethenes to predominantly trans-DCE in tidal flat sediment incubations.",NA,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01571.x,character(0),NA,NA

The results of these simulations demonstrate that air-water exchange controls phytoplankton concentrations in remote aquatic environments with little influence from land-based sources of pollutants and supports levels in even historically contaminated systems. Furthermore, eutrophication or high biomass leads to a disequilibrium between the gas and dissolved phase, enhanced air-water exchange, and vertical sinking fluxes of PCBs. increasing biomass also depletes the water concentrations leading to lower than equilibrium PCB concentrations in phytoplankton.

Although CO2 leaks are not expected in well-chosen and operated storage sites, monitoring is required by legislation and any leakage needs to be quantified under the EU Emissions Trading Directive. The objective of the present research was to test if C-13 stable isotope motoring of soil and canopy atmosphere CO2 increases our detection sensitivity for CCS-CO2 as compared with concentration monitoring only. A CO2 injection experiment was designed to create a horizontal CO2 gradient across 6 m x 3 m plots, which were sown with oats in 2011 and 2012. Injected CO2 was methane derived and had an isotopic signature of -46.2%. The CO2 concentrations were measured within the soil profile with passive samplers and at several heights within the crop canopies. The CO2 fluxes and their C-13 signatures were also measured across the experimental plots. In situ monitoring and gas samples measurements were conducted with a cavity ring down spectrometer (CRDS). The plots displayed hot spots of injected-CO2 leakage clearly detectable by either concentration or isotopic signature measurements. In addition, the C-13 signature measurements allow us to detect injected CO2 in plot regions where its presence could not be unequivocally ascertained based on concentration measurement alone.

Concentrations of total PFASs (∑PFASs) were in the range of 0.98–2.64 ng/L in water and 0.19–0.66 ng/g (dry weight, dw) in sediment, respectively. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the most abundant PFAS in water, while PFASs in sediment were dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and PFOA. Among investigated environmental parameters (total organic carbon (TOC), grain size, water pH, sediment pH, and salinity), TOC and salinity were the dominant factors influencing the sediment-water distribution coefficient (Kd) of PFOA, perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Log Kd and log soil organic carbon-water distribution coefficient (Koc) both increase with increasing carbon chain length of PFASs.

Thick-billed murres were collected from five colonies (Coats Island, Digges Island, Akpatok Island, Prince Leopold Island, Minarets) and northern fulmars from two colonies (Prince Leopold Island, Minarets). Legacy organochlorines (e.g. PCBs, DDT, chlorobenzenes, chlordanes) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) dominated the compositional profiles of the measured halogenated compounds in the livers of both species at all colonies. Among the murre colonies sampled, Prince Leopold Island birds generally had the highest mean concentrations of organochlorines, whereas the highest mean concentration of sum (Sigma) polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) was found at the Minarets and the lowest at Prince Leopold Island. PBDEs were detected in only a few fulmar livers from the Minarets and in none of the fulmar livers from Prince Leopold Island. Mean PFOS concentrations were highest in both murre and fulmar livers at Prince Leopold Island. PFOS was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the mean sum (Sigma) perfluorinated carboxylate (PFCA) concentration in both species and at all colonies. The reasons for inter-colony and inter-species differences in contaminant liver levels are probably variable and complex, and likely reflect differences in contaminant transport and exposure pathways, as well as differences among colonies in their diets and overwintering areas. To our knowledge, this is the first spatial assessment of PBDEs, PFCAs and PFOS in seabirds from the Canadian Arctic. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Baseline interviews and anthropometric assessments were conducted, followed by blood collection for the quantification of seven serum PFCs (perfluorosulfonates, perfluorocarboxylates, and perfluoro sulfonamides) using tandem mass spectrometry. Men collected a baseline semen sample and another approximately 1 month later. Semen samples were shipped with freezer packs, and analyses were performed on the day after collection. We used linear regression to estimate the difference in each semen parameter associated with a one unit increase in the natural log-transformed PFC concentration after adjusting for confounders and modeling repeated semen samples. Sensitivity analyses included optimal Box-Cox transformation of semen quality end points.; Results: Six PFCs [2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetate (Me-PFOSA-AcOH), perfluoro decanoate (PFDeA), perfluoro nonanoate (PFNA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), perfluoro octane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluoro octanoic acid (PFOA)] were associated with 17 semen quality end points before Box-Cox transformation. PFOSA was associated with smaller sperm head area and perimeter, a lower percentage of DNA stainability, and a higher percentage of bicephalic and immature sperm. PFDeA, PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS were associated with a lower percentage of sperm with coiled tails.; Conclusions: Select PFCs were associated with certain semen end points, with the most significant associations observed for PFOSA but with results in varying directions. © 2014, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The study included point sources (municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants and landfill sites) and the marine and freshwater environments. Effluent and influent water and sewage sludge were analysed for point sources. Sediment, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and liver from plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), flounder (Platichthys flesus) and eel (Anguilla anguilla) were analysed for the freshwater and marine environments. The results obtained show a diffuse PFCs contamination of the Danish environment with concentrations similar to those measured in other countries with the absence of primary contamination sources such as fluorochemical production. PFOS and PFOA were generally the most dominating PFCs measured in both point sources and the aquatic environments. PFCs were found in both inflow and outflow water and sewage sludge from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), indicating that WWTPs can be significant sources to PFCs in the environment. This is also reflected in the locally elevated PFCs concentrations found in fish like eels from shallow freshwater and marine areas. However, the highest PFCs concentrations found in fish in this study was in plaice from the Skagerrak (156 ng/g wet weight PFOS), but it is unknown if this can be related to significant sources in the North Sea region or to differences between species. The concentrations of PFCs were below the detection limit in all analysed freshwater and marine samples of sediment and mussels. Despite the relatively low PFCs concentrations measured in marine fish, the high bioaccumulation potential of PFCs, particularly PFOS, may lead to high concentrations of PFCs in marine mammals as shown by previous investigations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

PBDE contamination was ubiquitous, reaching the highest total concentration of 193.2 pg g−1 w.w. BDE-209 was the most abundant compound, followed by penta-BDE components BDE-49, -100, −99, −153, −154, and −47 in decreasing order.

Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of lipid, especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on lipid metabolism responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8:2 Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty acid exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty acid β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty acid β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms. Although characterized with different toxic mode-of-action, these novel alternatives can elicit hepatic steatosis as strong as PFOS, stressing the biological risks in view of their global contamination. © 2019 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2019.105262,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Liver;animal;concentration (parameter);fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;carbon;Carbon;controlled study;animal tissue;chemistry;in vivo study;lipid;lipid metabolism;molecular docking;Molecular Docking Simulation;water pollutant;Chlorine compounds;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;sulfonate;toxicity;drug effect;Cytology;Fatty acids;fatty liver;liver;liver toxicity;pathology;Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor;priority journal;water contamination;metabolism;structure activity relation;Structure-Activity Relationship;animal model;zebra fish;chemical structure;genetic transcription;Zebrafish;cyprinid;Danio rerio;fatty acid oxidation;triacylglycerol;Aquatic organisms;lipid storage;Mode of action;acyl coenzyme A oxidase;Chain length;Oxidation;Water Pollutants;cytochrome P450 1A;cell vacuole;Chemical;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor;larva;Larva;chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid;Zebrafish larvae;acox1 gene;cyp1a gene;Transcription;acacb gene;acadm gene;acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase;acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase;apob gene;apolipoprotein B100;chlorinated polyfluorooctane sulfonic acid;Cytochrome p450 enzymes;fatty acid synthesis;fatty acid transport;Hepatic steatosis;Novel chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl alternatives;Structural specificity;Structure-dependent mode-of-action;Sulfones,NA,NA

To explore the transgenerational thyroid-disrupting capacity of F-53B, adult zebrafish (F0) were exposed to different concentrations of F-53B (0, 5, 50, or 500 μg/L) for 180 d, with their offspring (F1 and F2) subsequently reared in uncontaminated water. Thyroid disturbances were then examined in the three (F0, F1, and F2) generations. For F0 adult fish, thyroxine (T4) increased in both sexes after exposure to 50 μg/L F-53B, whereas 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) decreased in all groups, except for 50 μg/L F-53B-treated males. For F1 embryos, parental exposure resulted in F-53B transfer as well as an increase in T4 content. At 5 days post-fertilization, the significant increase in T4 and decrease in T3 were accompanied by a decrease in body length, increase in mortality, and increase in uninflated posterior swim bladder occurrence in F1 larvae. Although thyroid hormone levels were not changed significantly in F1 adult fish or F2 offspring compared with the control, the transcription levels of several genes along the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis were significantly modified. Our study demonstrated that F-53B possesses transgenerational thyroid-disrupting capability in zebrafish, indicating it might not be a safer alternative to PFOS. © 2018",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.198,Fish;Female;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Thyroid Hormones;Ethers;animal;environmental exposure;female;Hormones;male;Male;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;thyroid hormone;Thyroid hormones;unclassified drug;controlled study;sex difference;environmental monitoring;water pollutant;organohalogen;chlorination;pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;sulfonic acid derivative;toxicity;Toxicity;dose response;drug effect;embryo development;Embryonic Development;embryo;Environmental matrixes;mortality;priority journal;blood;chemical analysis;pollution effect;F-53B;metabolism;down regulation;hormone;molecular dynamics;protein binding;zebra fish;chemical structure;upregulation;genetic transcription;Zebrafish;nonmammalian embryo;gene expression profiling;cell viability;cyprinid;Danio rerio;hormonal regulation;Thyroid hormone;Alkanesulfonates;Embryo;transcription regulation;Water Pollutants;Chemical;4;2;5;1;3;transthyretin;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;larva;analysis of variance;Post-fertilization;Nonmammalian;6;polyfluorinated ether sulfonate;Transcription;2-((6-chloro-1;2-tetrafluoroethanesulfonic acid;6-dodecafluorohexyl)oxy)-1;gene disruption;glucuronidation;Hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis;hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system;malformation syndrome;photoperiodicity;Transcription level;Transgenerational toxicity;transgenic organism;Sulfones;Ether;Thyroid Gland,NA,NA

Despite the global presence of PFAS, knowledge of PFAS on the African continent is limited because monitoring of PFAS is challenging and often not feasible owing to the lack of analytical capacity and high cost. However, it is necessary to understand the environmental risks posed by these chemicals in developing countries, because increasing urbanization will likely increase PFAS contamination in the environment. Although, as far as is known, PFAS concentrations in the African aquatic environment are generally lower than in more developed countries, exceedances of ecological quality standards (EQS) were reported in a few cases, providing evidence of potential ecological risks to these ecosystems. However, the number of ecosystems at risk will likely increase as urbanization and modernization increase in African countries. Therefore, environmental regulations should be updated and implemented to reduce further contamination of the aquatic environment with these chemicals. In addition, analytical laboratories in Africa should develop their capacity to detect PFAS and related compounds regularly and routinely. Local hot spots need to be identified, the influence of these hot spots on the PFAS burden in the environment should be investigated, and environmental regulations should be implemented for these hot spots to reduce their environmental impact. Therefore, we recommend a more routine monitoring of PFAS, including new PFAS that are currently used as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) alternatives, which are not regulated and environmentally concerning.

A simple Level I equilibrium partitioning model predicted the environmental behaviour of HDBPs to be similar to a tetrabrominated diphenyl ether. Only slight differences in behaviour amongst HDBP congeners were predicted since substitution of a bromine for a chlorine (Cl/Br substitution) atom had less effect than H/Cl or H/Br substitution on P-L,25(o) S-w,S-25, H-25, and K-ow.

Lengthy half-lives and resistance to environmental degradation result in bioaccumulation of PFAAs in humans and wildlife. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the most prevalent PFAA detected within the environment, is found at high levels in occupationally exposed humans. We have monitored the environmental exposure of dolphins in the Charleston, SC region for over 10 years and levels of PFAAs, and PFOS in particular, were significantly elevated. As dolphins may serve as large mammal sentinels to identify the impact of environmental chemical exposure on human disease, we sought to assess the effect of environmental PFAAs on the cellular immune system in highly exposed dolphins. Herein, we utilized a novel flow cytometry-based assay to examine T cell-specific responses to environmental PFAA exposure ex vivo and to exogenous PFOS exposure in vitro. Baseline PFOS concentrations were associated with significantly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation from a heterogeneous resident dolphin population. Further analysis demonstrated that in vitro exposure to environmentally relevant levels of PFOS promoted proinflammatory cytokine production and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings indicate that PFOS is capable of inducing proinflammatory interferon-gamma, but not immunoregulatory interleukin-4 production in T cells, which may establish a state of chronic immune activation known to be associated with susceptibility to disease.

Due to their bioaccumulative and endocrine disruption implications, these chemicals can affect food quality and human health, respectively. In the present study, the bioconcentration and biotransformation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were evaluated in a biphasic system (exposure and depuration). Carp were continuously exposed, under laboratory conditions, to 10 (Experiment 1) and 100 (Experiment 2) µg/L PFOA for 14 weeks, followed by a wash out period of 3 weeks. Fish organs and tissues were collected at 8, 12, 14 weeks of exposure and at week 17, after the depuration period. The results obtained from the LC-MS/MS analysis showed the presence of PFOA in all studied organs. The highest values of PFOA were identified in the gallbladder (up to 2572 ng/g d.w.) in Experiment 1 and in the gallbladder (up to 18,640 ng/g d.w.) and kidneys (up to 13,581 ng/g d.w.) in Experiment 2. The average BCF varied between 13.4 and 158 L/Kg in Experiment 1 and between 5.97 and 80.3 L/Kg in Experiment 2. Four biotransformation products were identified and quantified in all organs, namely: PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, and PFHpA. PFBA was proven to be the dominant biotransformation product, with the highest values being determined after 8 weeks of exposure in the kidney, gallbladder, brain, liver, and gonads in both experiments. Because freshwater fish are an important food resource for the human diet, the present study showed the fishes’ capacity to accumulate perfluoroalkyl substances and their metabolites. The study revealed the necessity of monitoring and risk studies of new and modern synthetic chemicals in aquatic resources. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,10.3390/foods12071423,PFOA;biotransformation;Cyprinus carpio;bioconcentration;Biotransformation,NA,NA

We also combined our measurements with those of a previous study to provide an updated assessment of long-term trends. Concentrations of PFCs generally increased from the late 1970s until the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, after which concentrations either remained unchanged (perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorocarboxylates) or declined (perfluorodecanesulfonate (PFDS)). The temporal trends were assessed using three models, quadratic, exponential rise to maximum, and two-segment linear piecewise function, and then evaluated for best fit using Akaike Information Criteria. For PFOS and perfluorocarboxylates, the exponential rise to maximum function had the best fit. This is particularly interesting for PFOS as it suggests that although concentrations in Lake Ontario Lake Trout may have stopped increasing in response to voluntary phase-outs in 2000-2002, declines have yet to be observed. This may be due to continuing input of PFOS from products still in use and/or slow degradation of larger precursor molecules. A power analysis of PFOS suggested that 15 years of data with a within-year sample size of 10 is required to obtain sufficient power (80%) to detect a 5% decreasing trend. However, the length of the monitoring program had a greater influence on the ability to detect a trend compared to within-year sample size. This provides evidence that additional sampling years are required to detect a response to bans and phase-outs, given the variability in the fish data. The lack of observed declines of perfluorocarboxylate residues in fish may be expected as regulations for these compounds were only recently enacted. In contrast to the other compounds, the quadratic model had the best fit for PFDS. The results of this study emphasize the importance of long-term monitoring for assessing the effectiveness of bans and phase-outs on PFCs in the environment.",NA,10.1021/es3006095,Ontario,NA,NA

PFASs are used in a range of industrial and chemical applications e.g. textiles, paper, packaging materials, paint and varnish, and fire-extinguishing liquids. Several PFASs are recognised as environmentally persistent organic pollutants and are associated with adverse health effects. Diet is considered the main source of exposure to PFASs. In 2008, the EFSA Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) performed a risk assessment for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) concluding that it is unlikely that adverse effects of PFOS or PFOA are occurring in the general population. The CONTAM Panel acknowledged the limitation of available data and recommended further monitoring of PFAS in food. The present report summarises occurrence data for PFASs collected in 13 European countries during the period 2006 to 2012. A total of 54,195 analytical results covering a list of 27 substances were included in the assessment. The overall proportion of quantified results was very low. Across food groups, PFASs were found more frequently in fish and other seafood and in meat and meat products (liver in particular). For PFOS, the dietary exposure estimates in the adult population was < 3.5 % of the TDI for average consumers and < 6.7 % of the TDI in high consumers. For the same consumer groups, exposure to PFOA represented < 0.3 % and < 0.5 % of the TDI, respectively. Exposure in toddlers was two to three times higher compared to adults. For the other PFASs evaluated, daily dietary exposure was estimated to be in the low ng/kg b.w. range. The current review confirmed that dietary exposure to PFOS and PFOA is highly unlikely to exceed health-based guidance values.

Here, we investigated the occurrence of 60 anionic, zwitterionic, and cationic PFAS in a food web of the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) near a major metropolitan area. Water, sediments, aquatic vegetation, invertebrates, and 14 fish species were targeted for analysis. Levels of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) in river water exceeded those of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and a zwitterionic betaine was observed for the first time in the St. Lawrence River. The highest mean PFAS concentrations were observed for the benthopelagic top predator Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu, Sigma(60)PFAS similar to 92 +/- 34 ng/g wet weight whole-body) and the lowest for aquatic plants (0.52-2.3 ng/g). Up to 33 PFAS were detected in biotic samples, with frequent occurrences of emerging PFAS such as perfluorobutane sulfonamide (FBSA) and perfluoroethyl cyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS), while targeted ether-PFAS all remained undetected. PFOS and long-chain perfluorocarboxylates (C10-C13 PFCAs) dominated the contamination profiles in biota except for insects where PFBA was predominant. Gammarids, molluscs, and insects also had frequent detections of PFOA and fluorotelomer sulfonates, an important distinction with fish and presumably due to different metabolism. Based on bioaccumulation factors >5000 and trophic magnification factors >1, long-chain (C10-C13) PFCAs, PFOS, perfluorodecane sulfonate, and perfluorooctane sulfonamide qualified as very bioaccumulative and biomagnifying.

This work investigates the potential use of microarray technology and gene expression profile analysis to screen common bottlenose dolphins for exposure to environmental contaminants through the immunological and/or endocrine perturbations associated with these agents. A dolphin microarray representing 24,418 unigene sequences was used to analyze blood samples collected from 47 dolphins during capture-release health assessments from five different US coastal locations (Beaufort, NC, Sarasota Bay, FL, Saint Joseph Bay, FL, Sapelo Island, GA and Brunswick, GA). Organohalogen contaminants including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners were determined in blubber biopsy samples from the same animals. A subset of samples (n = 10, males; n = 8, females) with the highest and the lowest measured values of PCBs in their blubber was used as strata to determine the differential gene expression of the exposure extremes through machine learning classification algorithms. A set of genes associated primarily with nuclear and DNA stability, cell division and apoptosis regulation, intra- and extra-cellular traffic, and immune response activation was selected by the algorithm for identifying the two exposure extremes. In order to test the hypothesis that these gene expression patterns reflect PCB exposure, we next investigated the blood transcriptomes of the remaining dolphin samples using machine-learning approaches, including K-nn and Support Vector Machines classifiers. Using the derived gene sets, the algorithms worked very well (100% success rate) at classifying dolphins according to the contaminant load accumulated in their blubber. These results suggest that gene expression profile analysis may provide a valuable means to screen for indicators of chemical exposure. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The pattern of PFSAs was dominated by perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; >89% of Sigma PFSA concentration) regardless of egg collection location. The highest Sigma PFSA concentrations were found in the eggs collected in the urbanized areas in the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River area [Big Chicken Island 308 ng/g ww, Toronto Harbour 486 ng/g ww, and Ile Deslauriers (HG) 299 ng/g ww]. Also, eggs from all freshwater colony sites had higher Sigma PFSA concentrations, which were significant (p < 0.05) in many cases, compared to the marine sites with the exception of the Sable Island colony in Atlantic Canada off the coast of Nova Scotia. C6 to C15 chain length PFCAs were detected in the eggs, although the pattern was variable among the 15 sites, where PFUnA and PFTrA dominated the pattern for most colonies. Like the Sigma PFSA, the highest concentrations of Sigma PFCA were found in the eggs from Big Chicken Island, Toronto Harbour, Ile Deslauriers (HG), and Sable Island. although not all freshwater sites had higher concentrations compared to marine sites. Dietary tracers [delta(15)N and delta(13)C stable isotopes (Sls)) revealed that PFSA and PFCA exposure is colony dependent. SI signatures suggested that gulls from most marine colony sites were exposed to PFCs via marine prey. The exception was the Mandarte Island colony in Pacific British Columbia, where PFSA and PFCA exposure appeared to be via terrestrial and/or freshwater prey consumption. The same was true for the freshwater sites where egg Sls suggested both aquatic and terrestrial prey consumption as the source for PFC exposure depending on the colony. Both aquatic (marine and freshwater) and terrestrial prey are likely sources of PFC exposure to gulls but exposure scenarios are colony-specific. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The production and consumption of plastics has increased tremendously worldwide because of their properties including pliability, low cost, versatility, durability, and lightweight. Currently, the global production of plastics exceeds 320 million tonnes (Mt) per year, with single-use plastic accounting for more than 40% of this total. Because plastic is non-biodegradable, the majority of its annual production accumulates and finally enters the aquatic systems. Aquatic biota may suffer physical damages, fatigue, reduced appetite, blockage of metabolic channels, and altered feeding behavior due to consumption of MPs. Occurrence of MPs in air and food samples has been documented across the world. Thus, the MPs may also pose a great risk to the health of human beings, because of the human exposure to MPs and their concerned harmful contaminants through food chain or ingestion through the air. Due to the vast abundance and deleterious effects of MPs, more studies are focusing on MPs to estimate their dispersion, fate, quantity, and transport in the global aquatic systems. Through this work we have reviewed various analytical techniques of MPs including the collection of samples from surface water and sediments, identification, and quantification. One of the most prevalent techniques for recognizing MPs is visual categorization, which can be improved by combining it with other techniques viz. spectrometry and thermal methods. This review provides an insight about the following objectives: (1) the global occurrence and distribution of MPs, (2) the extensive analysis of effects of MPs on aquatic biota, and (3) the assessment of the current methods for MP sampling and analysis.",NA,10.1002/masy.202100367,character(0),NA,NA

It has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its toxic effects. The guideline values of PFHxS are commonly associated with PFOS in various countries and regulatory agencies. In this study, multispecies bioassays were conducted to determine the ecological toxic effects of PFHxS, including plants, soil invertebrates, and soil microorganisms, which indicated the EC10/NOEC values ranged from 2.9 to 250 mg/kg. Where possible, logistic models were used to calculate the EC30 values for various endpoints. The species sensitivity distributions were employed to estimate the ecological investigation levels for PFHxS contamination in soils using toxicity results from literature and this study. The calculation using EC10/NOEC values from both literature and this study indicated a most conservative HC5 as 1.0 mg/kg (hazardous concentration for 5 % of the species being impacted). However, utilisation of EC30 values derived from this study resulted in a much higher HC5 for PFHxS in contaminated soils (13.0 mg/kg) which is at the higher end of the existing guideline values for PFOS for protecting ecological systems.

Large-scale assessment of wildlife exposure to both emerging and legacy PFAS plays a key role in effective biomonitoring to better discriminate regional contamination patterns and provide early warnings. Using eggs of two closely-related shorebird species collected across China during the breeding season in 2021, we constructed contrasting PFAS levels and profiles in coastal versus inland populations. The highest ∑PFAS concentrations were found in two Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) populations from the Bohai Sea, a semi-enclosed shallow bay located in northeast China. These two populations showed exceptionally high PFOA concentrations (mean: 94 and 121 ng/g wet weight; West and North Bohai Sea, respectively) dominating the overall PFAS profile (66% for both). This pattern is characteristic, compared to that of other seabird eggs worldwide. By comparison, PFAS profile in the white-faced plover (Charadrius dealbatus) population at the South China Sea coast was dominated by PFOS (46%), which showed similar levels to those at the North Bohai Sea coast (mean: 29 and 20 ng/g, respectively). PFAS concentrations of Kentish plovers from the remote Qinghai Lake were lower compared to the three coastal populations, and were dominated by PFNA (mean: 2.6 ng/g, 29%) and PFOS (mean: 2.5 ng/g, 27%). None of the eggs analyzed in the present study exceeded estimated toxicity reference values for PFOS or PFOA. Additionally, the emerging 6:2 Cl-PFESA was detected in eggs from all regions, while its concentrations were highest in the Bohai Sea populations, and short-chain PFBS was only detected in the North Bohai Sea population.

Only a small proportion of PFAS have been studied for human health effects. We tested the association between human blood levels of six PFAS and several clinical measures of organ and metabolic function in a nationally representative sample of 6768 participants aged 3–79 years old who participated in the Canadian Health Measures Survey. Cross-sectional associations were assessed by generalized linear mixed models incorporating survey-specific sampling weights. An increase in perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) equivalent to the magnitude of its geometric mean (GM) of 2.0 μg/L was associated with percentage (95% CI) increases in serum enzymes reflecting liver function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 3.7 (1.1, 6.4), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 11.8 (2.5, 21.8), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 3.2 (0.5, 5.9), and bilirubin 3.6 (2.7, 4.5). A GM increase in perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) of 0.2 μg/L was positively associated with percentage increases in GGT, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and calcium with respective increases of 15.5 (2.2, 30.4), 7.0 (1.0, 13.2), 10.7 (5.5, 16.1), 2.8 (0.2, 5.3), and 0.8 (0.3, 1.3).

We recently studied an actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin (Cfl) of Entamoeba invadens (Ei), and demonstrated its contribution to the encystation and excystation of E. invadens through actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Profilin is also an actin-binding protein but its function is different from that of Cfl in actin assembly. This study investigated E. invadens profilins in relation to encystation and excystation which were induced in axenic culture systems. A homology search of the E. invadens genome database and molecular cloning identified four profilins of the parasite named EiPFN1, EiPFN2, EiPFN3, and EiPFN4. There were also multiple genes of profilin in Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) and Entamoeba dispar (Ed), each of which had three profilins. A search for conserved domains revealed that these profilins of Entamoeba had actin, phosphoinositide, and poly-proline binding sites. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that EiPFN3 and EiPFN4 formed the same clades including EhPFN3 and EdPFN3, and EhPFN2 and EdPFN2, respectively, while EiPFN1 and EiPFN2 were separated from EhPFN1 and EdPFN1. Rabbit anti-EiPFN1 serum reacted with recombinant EiPFN3 and EiPFN4 but not EiPFN2, and also reacted with EiPFN in lysates of cysts and trophozoites. Immunofluorescence staining with this antiserum showed co-localization of EiPFN with actin beneath the cell membrane through the life stages and also showed cytoplasmic localization. Both proteins proved to be rich in pseudopodia of trophozoites. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the mRNA level of EiPFN1 and EiPFN4 in trophozoites was comparable but that of EiPFN2 and EiPFN3 was very low. During encystation, the mRNA expression of EiPFN1 and EiPFN4 increased remarkably in the early phase much higher than that of EiPFN2 and EiPFN3. Then, the expression of all four PFNs sharply decreased in the later phase. This was in contrast to the sharp decrease in the mRNA level of EiCfl-2 during encystation in our previous study. In cysts, EiPFN1 was most abundantly expressed and EiPFN4 was at a lower level, while the expressions of EiPFN2 and EiPFN3 were virtually absent. Following the induction of excystation, mRNA levels of EiPFN1, EiPFN2, and EiPFN4 in cysts 5 h after induction were significantly higher than those in cysts before induction, while that of EiPFN3 was slightly higher than before induction. The mRNAs of EiPFN1 increased most extensively when the excystation was induced in the presence of cytochalasin D. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) to EiPFN1 inhibited both encystation and excystation but not growth. These findings demonstrate different expression of EiPFNs and the contribution of EiPFN to the encystation and excystation.",NA,10.1007/s00436-011-2735-3,character(0),NA,NA

Concentrations of eight perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs) were determined and we report the first dataset on PFAS in UK seabirds before and after the PFOS ban. There were no significant differences in Sigma PFAS or Sigma PFSAs between both colonies. The Sigma PFSAs dominated the PFAS profile (>80%); PFOS accounted for the majority of the PFSAs (98-99%). In contrast, Sigma PFCAs concentrations were slightly but significantly higher in eggs from Ailsa Craig than in those from Bass Rock. The most abundant PFCAs were perfluorotridecanoate (PFTriDA) and perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnA) which, together with PFOA, comprised around 90% of the Sigma PFCAs. The Sigma PFSAs and Sigma PFCAs had very different temporal trends. Sigma PFSAs concentrations in eggs from both colonies increased significantly in the earlier part of the study but later declined significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the phasing out of PFOS production in the 2000s. In contrast, SPFCAs concentrations in eggs were constant and low in the 1970s and 1980s, suggesting minimal environmental contamination, but residues subsequently increased significantly in both colonies until the end of the study. This increase appeared driven by rises in long chain compounds, namely the odd chain numbered PFTriDA and PFUnA. PFOA, had a very different temporal trend from the other dominant acids, with an earlier rise in concentrations followed by a decline in the last 15 years in Ailsa Craig; later temporal trends in Bass Rock eggs were unclear. Although eggs from both colonies contained relatively low concentrations of PFAS, the majority had PFOS residues that exceeded a suggested Predicted No Effect Concentration and similar to 10% of the eggs exceeded a suggested Lowest-Observable-Adverse-Effect.

Experimental data suggest that they may be associated with adverse health outcomes, including asthma. However, there is little supporting epidemiological evidence. Methods: A total of 231 asthmatic children and 225 nonasthmatic controls, all from northern Taiwan, were recruited in the Genetic and Biomarkers study for Childhood Asthma. Structure questionnaires were administered by face-to-face interview. Serum concentrations of 11 PFCs and levels of immunological markers were also measured. Associations of PFC quartiles with concentrations of immunological markers and asthma outcomes were estimated using multivariable regression models. Results: Nine PFCs were detectable in most children (≥ 84.4%), of which perfuorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most abundant (median serum concentrations of 33.9 ng/mL in asthmatics and 28.9 ng/mL in controls). Adjusted odds ratios for asthma among those with the highest versus lowest quartile of PFC exposure ranged from 1.81 (95% CI: 1.02, 3.23) for the perfuorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) to 4.05 (95% CI: 2.21, 7.42) for perfuorooctanic acid (PFOA).

However, data on their possible combined toxic effects on terrestrial organisms are still lacking. In this study, we exposed earthworm Eisenia fetida to artificial soil spiked with different sub-lethal levels of PFOA, arsenite (As(III)) or their mixture for 28 days. The bioaccumulation and multi-biomarker responses in the earthworms were measured. Results showed that the co-existence of PFOA and As(III) in soil enhanced the bioaccumulation of arsenic while reduced the bioaccumulation of PFOA. Most selected biomarkers exhibited significant responses at higher exposure levels and indicated oxidative damages. Biomarker Response Index (BRI) was used to integrate the multi-biomarker responses and the results showed significant dose-effect relationships between biological health status and exposure levels. Moreover, variation analysis of multi-biomarkers and BRI proved that As(III) exhibited more toxicity than PFOA to the earthworms. Based on BRI results, Effect Addition Index (EAI) was calculated to evaluate the joint effects of the two toxicants. According to EAI, the joint toxicity of PFOA and As(III) was related to exposure concentration, changing from synergism to slight antagonism with the increase of exposure level. These results provide valuable toxicological information for the risk assessment of co-exposure to PFOA and arsenic in the soil environment. Moreover, this study proved that BRI is an effective tool to integrate multi-biomarker responses, and its combination with EAI provides a useful combined approach to evaluate the joint effects of mixed contamination systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132942,Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Bioaccumulation;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;biological marker;biomarker;Biomarkers;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;pollution exposure;oxidative stress;high performance liquid chromatography;risk assessment;Risk assessment;toxicity;Toxicity;soil;carboxylic acid;Soil;Soils;Soil pollution;octanoic acid;animal model;analysis;Caprylates;PFOA;catalase;glutathione transferase;soil pollutant;Soil Pollutants;Exposure level;glutathione peroxidase;superoxide dismutase;Oxidative stress;humidity;Arsenic;atomic fluorescence spectrometry;sublethal effect;earthworm;Joint effect;Eisenia fetida;Oligochaeta;Biomarker response;arsenic trioxide;Effect Addition Index;Joint toxicity;accumulation ratio;arsenite;Arsenites;arsenous acid derivative;biomarker response index;Biomarker response index;Biomarker Response Index;drug antagonism;drug potentiation;Earthworm Eisenia fetida;effect addition index;Effect addition indices;lactoperoxidase;MTS assay;Multi-biomarker approaches;nitrate transporter;Response indices;Biological Markers,NA,NA

Yellow eels (n = 30) were caught in three different points along the estuary to highlight variations between sites and sources of contaminations. Silver eels (n = 15) were also studied to compare contaminant impregnation between different life stages of the species. Average concentrations in the muscles of the eel ranged between: 857 and 4358 ng/g LW for the PCBs, 26 and 46 ng/g LW for the PBDEs, 130 and 1293 ng/g LW for the PFAS; and in bile: 31 and 286 mu g/g protein for the APs, 9 and 26 mu g/g protein for the OH-PAHs and ND-1213 ng/g protein for the BRA. Among PCBs, PCB 153 (40% contribution to the sum of PCBs) was predominant in all eel muscles. PBDE 47 (60%) was the most predominant PBDE congeners, while perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (85%) was the most widely detected PFAS. For APs, 4p-nonylphenol (91%) was the most abundant and for the OH-PAHs, it was 10H-Pyrene (63%). All the eels exceeded the environmental quality standards (EQS) for biota for the PBDEs and about 75% were higher than the EQS specific to PFOS. Finally, 20% of the analyzed eels presented TEQ concentrations above the maximum limits for lipid-rich species. These results supplied new data on the occurrence, levels, and patterns of 53 organic chemicals in the eels from the Loire estuary and they highlighted the need of further investigations focused notably on the potential effects of these chemicals on this species and their analysis in the water and sediments of the estuary.

Survey results of surface sediment and water indicated that shorter chained PFASs were predominant in and near urban/industrial area watersheds, while longer chained PFASs were predominant in fine-grained sediment from major depositional basins. Niagara River suspended solids (1981-2006) demonstrated temporal trends that may have been influenced by recent changes in North American production and use of PFASs. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) reached a peak concentration in 2001 of 1.1 ng/g, followed by a decrease from 2001 to 2006 (half-life = 9 years). Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) increased from 2001 to 2006 (doubling time = 2 years) reaching a peak concentration of 0.80 ng/g. In contrast, three sediment cores from western, central, and eastern lake Ontario showed increasing temporal trends to surface sediment for all PFASs. PFOA and PFOS concentrations increased from 1988 to 2004 (doubling time = -4 years) in the western Lake Ontario core. The observed variations in temporal trends from different environmental compartments may be a result of the physicochemical properties of PFASs, ongoing emissions, and the environmental transformation and degradation of PFAS precursor compounds.

Evaluating PFAS in food is complicated by the need to evaluate varied matrices and a lack of a standard, matrix-specific sample extraction methods. Prior food studies implemented universal rather than matrix-specific extraction approaches, which may yield false negatives and an underestimation of PFAS dietary exposure if methods are not suitable to all matrices. Here the objectives were to screen and optimize PFAS extraction methods for plants, tissues, and dairy; apply optimized extraction methods to a grocery store food survey; and compare estimated exposure to published reference doses (RfDs). Optimized, matrix-specific extractions generally yielded internal standard recoveries of 50-150% and matrix spike recoveries of 70-130%. The frequency of PFAS detection in grocery store foods (16 of 22 products) was higher than in previous work. PFAS were detected at concentrations of 10 ng kgdw−1 (perfluorobutane sulfonate; washed green beans and perfluorohexanoic acid; unwashed tomato) to 2680 ng kgdw−1 (perfluorohexane sulfonate; radish). Concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in carrots, lettuce, radish, and canned green beans yielded median exposure intake (EI) values of 0.016-0.240 ng per kgbw-day, which exceeded the EPA RfD (0.0015 ng per kgbw-day). Washing reduced radish PFOA concentrations below detection, but EIs at the reporting limit still exceeded the RfD. The combination of improved data quality and greater frequency of PFAS detection vs. prior studies plus EI > RfD for some PFAS suggests a need for matrix-specific extractions and analysis of PFAS in additional grocery store foods from broader geographic regions. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA,10.1039/d3em00268c,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;exposure;Vegetables;Article;concentration (parameter);fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;food;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Extraction;chemical compound;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;matrix;vegetable;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;dietary exposure;Dietary Exposure;Dietary exposure;polyfluoroalkyl substance;spike;standard;limit of detection;process optimization;extraction;tomato;lettuce;Exposure assessment;Sulphonates;carrot;Optimisations;bean;data quality;Extraction method;frequency;Green beans;grocery store;Grocery stores;medical parameters;occurrence;plant tissue;radish;reference dose;supermarket;Supermarkets,NA,NA

To explore the spatial distribution and influencing factors of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances(PFASs),thirty-five legacy and emerging PFASs were detected and analyzed in the surface sediments of Poyang Lake. Spatial distribution of PFASs was obtained by the spatial interpolation method. The results showed that the concentration of PFASs in the northwest was higher than that in the central and northern parts of Poyang Lake. Using annual precipitation,average annual temperature,elevation,and other nine factors as independent variables,the driving factors of the spatial distribution of PFASs in surface sediments were explored based on geo-detector. The results showed that organic carbon content,average annual temperature,and annual precipitation were the main driving factors affecting the spatial distribution of PFASs. The interaction of annual precipitation,organic carbon content,and other factors has greater explanatory power to the spatial distribution pattern of PFASs. The ecological risk assessment showed that the concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in the surface sediments of Poyang Lake were at low-risk levels.

However, these properties are accompanied by generally high aqueous solubility and toxic effects, resulting in growing scientific and public concern. Given the surge in PFAS analyses in recent years, recurrent incidents of analytical inconsistencies reported in the literature, and the demand for robust, standardized analytical methods, an effort to condense and quantitatively define/describe PFAS analytical issues was necessary. Thus, this work had two objectives. A review of PFAS analytical literature identified and compiled analytical challenges with specific attention to interlaboratory studies and information related to low analyte recoveries. Data from a series of systematic experiments quantitatively helped to identify those differences in the analytical methodologies that caused inconsistencies and may compromise PFAS analytical results. The adsorptive properties of these unique compounds were identified as the primary source of analytical irreproducibility, particularly for analytes with a perfluoroalkyl chain length exceeding nine carbons. More specifically, solvent composition (water/methanol ratio) was found to be the primary contributor to adsorptive analyte losses with a significant increase in adsorption occurring when water content of the analyzed solution was raised beyond 25%. The container material used also affected adsorptive losses for solutions with elevated water fractions. Contrary to literature reports, polypropylene containers generally resulted in greater analyte losses compared to amber borosilicate glass containers. These findings led to modifications of sample preparation procedures to provide a more robust analytical methodology. This methodology was subsequently utilized in the analysis of 300 biological tissue samples. A detailed procedure and discussion of its performance are provided. These findings and the connections made to the cited literature will provide the framework for a standardized method for PFAS extraction and analysis of biological tissues. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA,10.1039/c9ew00765b,Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Extraction;Histology;quantitative analysis;Tissue;toxicity;Tissue engineering;organofluorine;extraction method;Polypropylenes;solubility;Perfluoroalkyl chains;analytical framework;Driers (materials);Adsorptive properties;Analytical methodology;Borosilicate glass;condensation;Containers;Interlaboratory studies;Polypropylene containers;Sample preparation procedure;Systematic experiment,NA,NA

Thus, our objective was to assess the aqueous toxicity of PFOA in chronic tests with Hyalella azteca (amphipod) and early-life stage tests with Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow). Toxicity data were analyzed based on measured PFOA concentrations. Amphipod exposures were 42 d (0.84–97 mg/L) and examined survival, growth, and reproduction. Fathead minnow exposures were 21 d (0.010–76 mg/L), which encompassed hatching (5 d) and larval stages until 16 d post-hatch; endpoints included hatching success, deformities at hatch, and larval survival and growth. Amphipod survival was significantly reduced at 97 mg/L (42-d LC50 = 51 mg/L), but growth and reproduction were more sensitive endpoints (42-d EC50 for both endpoints = 2.3 mg/L). Fathead minnows were less sensitive than amphipods, exhibiting no significant effects in all endpoints with the exception of uninflated swim bladder, which was significantly higher at 76 mg/L (15%) than controls (0%). Maximum concentrations of PFOA are generally in the ng/L range in global surface waters, but can reach the μg/L range in close proximity to major source inputs; therefore, environmental concentrations are well below those that caused toxicity in the current study.

Methods • Pregnant women were recruited from the Laizhou Wan Birth Cohort (LWBC) in Shandong from September 2010 to December 2013. A total of 149 pregnant women were finally enrolled who completed questionnaires and provided sufficient biological samples for pollutants measurement including blood lead, blood mercury, urinary metabolites of OPs[dimethylphosphate (DMP), dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP), diethylphosphate (DEP), diethylthiophosphate (DETP), etc.], serum perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), as well as urinary TCS. Spearman correlation analysis and cosine cluster analysis were used to explore the correlation between pollutants. Results • The detection rates of lead, DMP, PFOA and PFOS were all 100.0%. And the detection rates of mercury, DMTP, DEP, DETP and TCS were 89.3%, 81.2%, 97.3%, 96.6% and 59.1%, respectively. The median and range of concentrations for lead, mercury, PFOA, PFOS and TCS were 28.40 (11.30-65.70) μg/L, 0.85 (<LOD-10.98) μg/L, 39.54 (1.16-273.68) μg/L, 4.56 (0.55-15.38) μg/L, 0.58 (<LOD-58.01) μg/g, respectively.

The concentrations of DMP and DEP were generally higher than those in developed countries. The concentration of PFOA was much higher than those in foreign studies, while the concentrations of PFOS and TCS were relatively lower. Correlation analysis and cosine cluster analysis revealed that mercury was positively correlated with PFOA (r=0.36, P=0.000) and PFOS (r=0.42, P=0.000).

Despite documented human exposure there are almost no toxicity data available to inform risk assessment of PFMOAA. Here we exposed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats to a range of PFMOAA doses (10-450 mg/kg/d) via oral gavage from gestation day (GD) 8 to postnatal day (PND) 2 and compared results to those we previously reported for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA or GenX). Newborn pups displayed reduced birthweight (≤30 mg/kg), depleted liver glycogen concentrations (all doses), hypoglycemia (≤125 mg/kg), and numerous significantly altered genes in the liver associated with fatty acid and glucose metabolism similar to gene changes produced by HFPO-DA. Pup survival was significantly reduced at ≤125 mg/kg, and at necropsy on PND2 both maternal and neonatal animals displayed increased liver weights, increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and reduced serum thyroid hormones at all doses (≤10 mg/kg). Pups also displayed highly elevated serum cholesterol at all doses. PFMOAA concentrations in serum and liver increased with maternal oral dose in both maternal and F1 animals and were similar to those we reported for PFOA but considerably higher than HFPO-DA. We calculated 10% effect levels (ED10 or EC10) and relative potency factors (RPF; PFOA = index chemical) among the three compounds based on maternal oral dose and maternal serum concentration (μM). Reduced pup liver glycogen, increased liver weights and reduced thyroid hormone levels (maternal and pup) were the most sensitive end points modeled. PFMOAA was ∼3-7-fold less potent than PFOA for most end points based on maternal serum RPFs, but slightly more potent for increased maternal and pup liver weights. PFMOAA is a maternal and developmental toxicant in the rat producing a constellation of adverse effects similar to PFOA and HFPO-DA. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

Boron nitride (BN), consisting of light elements and bearing excellent thermal stability, has shown great potential in wastewater purification as a readily-recyclable sorbent. In this study, porous hexagonal BN nanosheets (h-BNs) were synthesized and for the first time their sorption capacities toward perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) (two representative PFASs) were evaluated under various solution compositions. The h-BNs used after sorption were regenerated by calcining at 600 °C in air for 20 min. The h-BNs synthesized were found to have fast sorption kinetics for both PFOS and PFDA, and the sorption processes fitted well with the Freundlich model and pseudo-second-order kinetics. Under the conditions of 50 mg L−1 PFDA or PFOS, 0.2 g L−1 h-BNs, and pH 6.0, sorption capacities of ∼0.72 mg m−2 and ∼0.45 mg m−2 were achieved for PFDA and PFOS, respectively. The effects of H+ and Ca2+ showed that electrostatic interactions were responsible for the sorption. The reutilization experiments revealed that the h-BNs had a persistent sorption capacity after three cycles. To reduce the production of fluorine-containing gases, calcium hydroxide was used as a calcination additive and the fluorine-fixing product calcium fluoride was successfully detected. The results suggest that h-BN sorption may be a promising approach for the removal of PFASs from an aqueous solution. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA,10.1039/C6RA15564B,Biochemistry;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Solutions;Sorption;Fluorine compounds;Chemicals removal (water treatment);Freundlich models;Sorption capacities;perfluoroalkyl substance (PFASs);Poly;Calcination;Boron nitride;Calcium fluoride;Chemical elements;Decomposition;Fluorspar;Hexagonal boron nitride;Hydrated lime;III-V semiconductors;Lime;Nitrides;Pseudo second order kinetics;Solution composition;Wastewater purification;Adsorption;Regeneration,NA,NA

Increasing attention has been focused on method development for the detection of PFAS in various media; however, these methods are typically tedious, require high solvent volumes, and are time consuming. The present method used a Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) extraction approach and analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to detect 28 PFAS in Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) tissue. This method was validated using limit of detection, limit of quantitation, and precision and accuracy studies. Limits of detection ranged from 0.2 to 5.8 ng g−1, limits of quantitation ranged from 0.66 to 19.2 ng g−1, and recoveries spanned 52.1–105.9% at the 100 ng mL−1 analyte level. Analysis of 12 unknown oyster composite samples revealed the detection of PFHxA, PFPeS, PFOA, PFHpA and PFOS and at least two compounds were detected in each oyster sample. This validated method proved to be an efficient and environmentally friendly sample preparation method for PFAS analysis in complex tissue media, such as oysters. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,10.1080/00032719.2024.2302399,shellfish;QuEChERS;per-;Oyster;oysters;polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS);ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS);Multiple Sclerosis,NA,NA

The muscle tissue of the two adult fish species most commonly used as bioindicators in central Europe and whole body homogenates of various species of young-of-the-year (YOY) fish were used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential to replace adult fish muscle tissue with YOY fish for contamination monitoring. All of the toxic metals and five of the fifteen PFASs were found in the YOY fish samples while only mercury and PFOS were detected in the muscle tissue of adults. The concentration of total mercury (THg) in the YOY fish homogenates ranged between 0.014 and 0.062 μg g−1. Of the spectrum of analysed pollutants, only the THg concentrations were lower in YOY fish homogenates than in adult muscle tissue. The cadmium concentration varied from 0.004 to 0.024 μg g−1 and the lead concentration varied from 0.032 to 0.396 μg g−1 in YOY fish homogenates, while in most of the adult samples, Cd and Pb were below the detection limit of the analytical methods employed. The PFOS concentrations in YOY fish homogenates were comparable to the concentrations frequently found in adult liver tissue. These results show that mixed shoals of YOY fish can be successfully used for aquatic bio-monitoring. Interspecific variability in the concentrations of the target pollutants in YOY fish whole body homogenates is usually lower than the intraspecific variability of the concentrations of the pollutants in adult fish muscle. YOY fish were found to be a suitable bioindicator and have several advantages compared to adult fish. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.watres.2016.07.046,PFAS;Biomonitoring;Fish;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Mercury;animal;nonhuman;biological monitoring;biomonitoring;biological marker;environmental monitoring;animal tissue;water pollutant;Muscle;bioindicator;Biomarkers;fish;concentration (composition);adult;homogenate;muscle;muscle tissue;liver;atomic absorption spectrometry;cadmium;lead;Elbe River;priority journal;metal;water contamination;mercury;mercury (element);Mercury (metal);limit of detection;aquatic environment;River pollution;feeding behavior;biodiversity;Fishes;cyprinid;prospective study;freshwater environment;Freshwater;Chemical detection;Czech Republic;Fresh Water;Prospective Studies;toxic material;Bream;Hyperoglyphe porosa;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Muscle tissues;Chub;Contamination monitoring;Fish homogenate;intraspecific variation;Leuciscus cephalus;Toxic metals;young of the year fish,NA,NA

The behavior and mechanisms of 6:2 Cl-PFAES in the electroplating industry and the receiving environment were studied and compared with PFOS. 6:2 Cl-PFAES behaved similarly with PFOS due to their similar chemical structure. However, some difference exists for the relatively stronger hydrophobicity of 6:2 Cl-PFAES. Up to 35.7 mg/L of PFOS and 13.4 mg/L of 6:2 Cl-PFAES were found in the industrial wastewater influents, and were effectively reduced to 0.3–0.8 mg/L by the interaction with chromium hydroxide through hydrophobic interaction and ligand exchange. The stronger hydrophobicity of 6:2 Cl-PFAES than PFOS resulted in its accumulation in the surface of foams and comparable or less removal during the industrial and municipal wastewater treatment. 6:2 Cl-PFAES exhibited higher bioaccumulation potential than PFOS in the surface water. 6:2 Cl-PFAES emitted by both mists and water may pose health risks to humans.

Their chemical properties make them persistent organic pollutants that are potential bioaccumulative and toxic. Most studies on PFAS have been performed in groundwater, surface water and aquatic biota. Our knowledge on the terrestrial fate of PFAS is therefore limited. We sampled soil, berries, mushrooms, and wildlife on the island Froson, central Sweden, in 2021 and 2022, to study the fate of 22 PFAS in a terrestrial food web. Groundwater, surface water and fish on Froson have previously shown high PFAS concentrations. Soil, berries, and mushrooms were also concurrently sampled in a reference area in northern Sweden. Overall, concentrations of the sum of PFAS were low in berries and mushrooms. In moose (Alces alces), roedeer (Capreolus capreolus), and bank vole (Myodes glareolus), concentrations were highest in liver. The maximum levels for PFAS in offal as set by the European Commission (50 ng/g ww) were exceeded in the liver of two of 10 roedeer. Bank voles (n = 12 pools) that were sampled in the vicinity of a firefighting training site showed partly extreme concentrations with none of the samples having liver concentrations <474 ng/g ww (maximum 11,600 ng/g ww). Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for multiple PFAS in bank voles were higher for the studied mushrooms and soil compared to studied berries and were >100 for 27 out of 265 calculated BAFs. BAFs in the ungulate species were generally lower than those for bank voles but were >1 for several PFAS from the mushroom. The exact origin of PFAS in bank voles could not be identified in our study, but the BAFs are supported by the feeding and behaviour ecology of bank voles, i.e., there is likely bioaccumulation and biomagnification from soil and mushrooms to bank voles. The measured PFAS concentrations and BAFs, especially those in bank voles are worrying from an ecosystem and One Health perspective considering that voles are staple food for multiple predators.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",NA,10.1101/2023.12.12.571392,Biology;Persistent organic pollutants;Sweden;Bioaccumulation;Groundwater;Cosmetics;Perfluorochemicals;Food webs;Food chains;Surface water;Textiles;Fruits;Rodents;Berries;Carpets;Feeding behavior;Mushrooms;Perfluoroalkyl & polyfluoroalkyl substances;Predators,NA,NA

We demonstrate here the formation of PFOA and PFOS in earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) from a group of four zwitterionic/cationic polyfluoroalkyl amides and sulfonamides. In bioaccumulation tests, the zwitterionic PFAS compounds were metabolized within 10 days to PFOA/PFOS at yields of 3.4-20.8 mol % by day 21 and several infrequently reported PFAS species for which chemical structures were determined using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Cationic PFAS, on the other hand, were found to be much less metabolizable in terms of the number (n = 2) and yields (0.9-5.1 mol %) of metabolites. Peak-shaped bioaccumulation profiles were frequently observed for the studied PFAS. Residual zwitterionic/cationic PFAS in earthworms were detected at the end of the elimination phase, indicating that not all zwitterionic/cationic PFAS molecules in vivo are available for enzymatic degradation.

Among these substances, the poly-fluorinated compounds (PFASs) represents a case of interest due to their specific physicochemical properties. So the PFAs behavior in the environment is difficult to predict as the existing tools are not suitable. Athough it is recognized that these compounds are persistent and accumulate in biota, many knowledge gaps remain, including the mechanisms of sediment-biota transfer and the factors that control them. This thesis examines the role of sediment in the accumulation process, especially (a) exposure routes of biota, (b) role of biodiversity in the accumulation, by exposing two benthic invertebrates (Chironomus riparius and Gammarus sp.) to natural sediment. The description of PFASs kinetics of accumulation and elimination have showed the biodisponibility of the compounds to organisms. Thus, a bioaccumulation model including the organisms growth and the specificity of the compounds was used to estimate the accumulation and depuration rate constants (ku and ke). A conceptual representation of compounds transfer allowed us to understand the major routes for organisms contamination. Moreover, the interspecific variability has been assessed by comparing the PFASs bioaccumulation and transfer pathways for both invertebrates. This thesis have helped to open up many issues, and especially the influence of both biofilm and organism bioturbation on PFASs bioaccumulation. Moreover some new perspectives on the study of biomagnification were opened. ; L'accumulation de composés persistants dans le biote constitue des préoccupations écologiques, sanitaires et réglementaires.

This study examined the distribution of PFCs in relation to land use using blood samples collected from bottlenose dolphins during capture-release health assessment surveys conducted in Charleston, SC. The study area was partitioned into three subareas (ACW, CHS, and SRE) based upon habitat and land use characteristics. The ACW and CHS subareas are characterized by high degrees of industrial and urban land uses, while the SRE subarea is more residential and characterized by a lower degree of developed land use. Long-term monitoring data from photo-identification surveys were used to group bottlenose dolphins based on their proportions of sightings in the different subareas. Dolphins affiliated with both the ACW and CHS subareas were observed to have significantly higher mean plasma concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA) than those affiliated with the SRE subarea. Dolphins affiliated with the ACW subarea were found to have a significantly higher mean plasma concentration of PFUnA than those affiliated with the CHS subarea. Further examination of the distribution of the PFCs revealed positive correlations with developed land uses and negative correlations with wetland/marsh land cover. A positive correlation was also observed between PFUnA and agricultural land use. The variability and scale of the observed contaminant burdens have important implications for the conservation and management of living marine resources and illustrates the importance of long-term monitoring of free-ranging wildlife species. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.marenvres.2008.07.004,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;United States;Ecosystem;Marine biology;Marine pollution;nonhuman;unclassified drug;alkyl group;perfluoro compound;Chlorine compounds;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;spatial distribution;concentration (composition);marine environment;Bottle-Nosed Dolphin;bottlenose dolphin;Charleston;land use;South Carolina;Tursiops;Tursiops truncatus;urbanization;blood level;article;Urbanization;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;blood;correlation;Positive correlations;Estuaries;estuary;Surveys;environmental protection;Decanoic Acids;Plasmas;North America;Correlation methods;Turbulent flow;coastal zone;Offshore oil well production;Oceanography;perfluoroalkyl compound;Land use;Perfluoroalkyl compounds;Concentration (process);Water Pollutants;Blood samples;Arsenic compounds;Higher concentrations;Regional planning;Urban areas;species conservation;wetland;Chemical;Bottlenose dolphin;Bottlenose dolphins;dolphin;Dolphins (structures);Wildlife species;wildlife management;Land cover;wildlife conservation;Health assessments;estuarine ecosystem;Agricultural land uses;Coastal zone;Habitat;habitat conservation;Long-term monitoring;marine resource;Marine resources;Negative correlations;Plasma concentrations;resource management;Size distribution;Spatial distribution of;Spatial scale;Urban land,NA,NA

Nevertheless, changes in biomolecular structure and function of duckweed caused by PFASs and their alternatives remain unknown thus far. Herein, the effects of four PFASs, including two common legacy PFASs (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) and two PFASs alternatives (perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and 1H,1H,2H, 2H-perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS)) on duckweed (Lemna minor) at biochemical level were investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Although no obvious inhibitions were observed in the growth of L. minor with PFASs exposure at three levels of 1 μg L−1, 100 μg L−1, and 10 mg L−1, significant structural and functional alterations were induced at the biochemical level. In response to PFASs exposure, lipid peroxidation, proteins aggregation and α-helix to β-sheet transformation of the protein conformation, as well as changes of DNA conformations were detected. Moreover, alterations in lipid, protein, and DNA were proved to be concentration-related and compound-specific. Compared to the two legacy PFASs (PFOS and PFOA), alternative ones exhibited greater effects on the biological macromolecules of L. minor.

Immunofluorescence was performed to determine the alterations in neural morphology. In addition, ELISA kits were used to measure level of the neurotransmitters Dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, single cell gel electrophoresis was measured to analyze DNA damage. In this study, PFOS treatment induced neural morphology defects, alterations in neural-related gene expression, alterations in neurotransmitter levels, and DNA damage. However, co-exposure to ANT and PFOS mitigated the damage to D. japonica induced by PFOS. Restoration of neurotransmitter contents and neural related genes expression were observed in planarians following co-application of ANT and PFOS, immunofluorescence showed that nerve morphology almost recovered, and DNA damage was decreased.

The organohalogens were ubiquitous in the environmental media and biota and enter humans through multiple pathways, including direct skin contact, breathing (occupational exposures), drinking water, and through food. Chlorinated compounds include polychlorinated -biphenyls (PCBs), -dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), -dibenzofurans (PCDFs), -naphthalanes (PCNs), and chlorinated pesticides (DDT, hexachlorobenzene, chlordane compounds, and hexachlorocyclohexanes). Exposure to these organohalogens is known to cause reproductive, neurotoxic, immunotoxic, endocrine disruption, behavioral abnormalities, and carcinogenic effects in wildlife and in humans. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) are considered as emerging new environmental pollutants. Human exposure to these chemicals are direct and intimate. Based on PBDE and PFC use, their recalcitrant property, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification potential, it can be predicted that the environmental contamination as well as human exposure to these compounds will continue to increase for several decades in both developed and developing countries.

However, limited experimental data hinder insight into the effects of the structural characteristics of emerging PFAS on their defluorination abilities. Therefore, in this study, we adopted quantity structure−activity relationship models based on machine learning algorithms to develop the predictive models of the relative defluorination ability of PFAS. Five-fold cross-validations were used to perform the hyperparameter tuning of the models, which suggested that the gradient boosting algorithms with PaDEL descriptors as the best model possessed superior predictive performance (R2test = 0.944 and RMSEtest = 0.114). The importance of the descriptor indicated that the electrostatic properties and topological structure of the compounds significantly affected the defluorination ability of the PFAS. For the emerging PFAS the best model showed that most compounds, such as potential alternatives of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, were recalcitrant to reductive defluorination, whereas perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids had relatively stronger defluorination abilities than perfluorooctanoic acid. The theoretical calculations implied that additional electrons on PFAS could cause molecular deconstruction, such as changes in the dihedral angle involved in the carbon chain, as well as C–F bond and ether C–O bond cleavages. In general, the current computational models could be useful for screening emerging PFAS to assess their defluorination ability for the molecular design of fluorochemical structures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151018,PFAS;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Carboxylic Acids;Ether;Ethers;unclassified drug;carbon;Carbon;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;quantitative analysis;risk assessment;carboxylic acid;polyfluoroalkyl substance;computer model;organofluorine;ether derivative;ether;numerical model;fluorine derivative;machine learning;quantitative structure activity relation;algorithm;quantum chemistry;Quantum chemistry;Machine learning;Machine Learning;defluorination;Defluorination;Computational chemistry;Best model;chemical bond;cross validation;Defluorination ability;Descriptors;Dihedral angle;Hydrated electron;QSAR;Quantum chemical computations;Quantum chemistry calculation;Quantum chemistry calculations;solvation,NA,NA

In this study, 32 pairs of maternal blood, cord blood, and placenta samples were collected from pregnant women in South China, and the blood was further separated into plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) for blood partitioning study. Short- and medium-chain CPs (SCCPs and MCCPs, respectively) were detected in all the five human biological matrices, suggesting prevalent exposure and maternal transfer of CPs in the pregnant women. Discrepant congener group profiles of CPs were observed in different human biological matrices. Significant differences in the plasma-RBC partitioning of CPs in the maternal and cord bloods were identified (p < 0.001). CP partitioning to plasma was stronger than that to RBCs in maternal blood, but the converse was true for cord blood. Mass fractions in plasma (Fp) for SCCPs (mean, 0.78) and MCCPs (0.74) in maternal blood were significantly higher than the values in cord blood. Transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) were evaluated based on the whole blood concentrations of CPs in the maternal and cord bloods, and the TTEs ranged from 0.50 to 0.69 (first to third quartiles) for SCCPs and MCCPs, indicating that the placenta can partially restrict maternal transfer. The extent of CP retention in the placenta was assessed by the concentration ratio (RPM) of matched placenta and maternal blood, and interestingly, a U-shaped trend for placental retention (RPM) with increasing chain length was observed for individual congener groups. Significant relationships of the CP concentrations among the maternal blood, cord blood, and placenta were observed (p < 0.001). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the plasma-RBC partitioning of CPs in human maternal and cord bloods, as well as the first study to evaluate TTEs based on whole blood concentrations.

The intrinsic rate of population growth was also calculated. In the continuous exposure, population growth-related adverse effects were detected during all test periods, and the adverse effect tended to be weaker in later generations. On the other hand, individual fitness-related adverse effects were observed from F1 not in F0 and deteriorated as the generation number increased. These results imply that individual fitness worsens although the population growth is restored in later generations. Upon discontinuous exposure, a few but significant adverse effects were observed during the non-exposure period and highest effects were detected during the re-exposure period. This encourages the study of different exposure scenarios, which may result in unexpected and higher PFOS toxicity.

To examine this phenomenon quantitatively, we exposed juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) simultaneously to a homologous series of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and sulfonates for 34 d in the diet, followed by a 41-d depuration period. Carcass and liver concentrations were determined by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and kinetic rates were calculated to determine compound-specific bioaccumulation parameters. Depuration rate constants ranged from 0.02 to 0.23/d, and decreased as the length of the fluorinated chain increased. Assimilation efficiency was greater than 50% for all test compounds, indicating efficient absorption from food. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) ranged from 0.038 to 1.0 and increased with length of the perfluorinated chain; however, BAFs were not statistically greater than 1 for any PFA. Sulfonates bioaccumulated to a greater extent than carboxylates of equivalent perfluoroalkyl chain length, indicating that hydrophobicity is not the sole determinant of PFA accumulation potential and that the acid function must be considered.

However, little is known about these substances and their associations with health parameters in wild terrestrial mammals. In this study, we determined PFAS levels and distribution in the blood of captive Siberian tigers in Harbin, China, and evaluated potential exposure pathways by daily intake. In addition, for the first time, we explored the associations between serum PFAS concentrations and clinical parameters. Results showed that perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was the dominant PFAS compound in blood (accounting for 64%), followed by perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). In addition, 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) concentrations were also detected in blood and dietary food. Furthermore, significant positive age relationships were observed for levels of perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA), PFOA, PFOS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA in the blood of female tigers. Results showed that PFOA and PFOS in dietary food accounted for over 70% of total daily intake of PFASs, indicating that meat consumption is a predominant exposure pathway in tigers. We also found positive associations between higher exposure to PFASs (including PFOA, PFOS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA) and elevated serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), a marker of liver damage. Thus, comprehensive health assessments of PFAS burdens in wildlife are needed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd; This study determined the bioaccumulation of legacy and emerging PFASs in captive Siberian tigers in China and identified eight PFASs that were positively associated with serum levels of ALT, a marker of liver damage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114805,Biochemistry;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;PFASs;chemical pollutant;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Ethers;China;animal;Blood;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;animal experiment;blood analysis;controlled study;dietary intake;sex difference;bioaccumulation;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Mammals;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;quality control;chlorination;concentration (composition);alkanesulfonic acid;wildlife;blood level;dietary exposure;blood;chemical analysis;protein blood level;animal cell;health hazard;Animalia;physiological response;ether derivative;terrestrial ecosystem;Mammalia;wild population;clinical assessment;parameter estimation;alanine aminotransferase;biochemistry;Amino acids;liver injury;Exposure pathways;Perfluorooctanoate;Alkanesulfonates;Biochemical parameters;canid;Daily intake;Clinical parameters;Health assessments;meat consumption;Panthera tigris longipilis;Potential exposure;Siberian tiger;tiger;Tigers,NA,NA

This leads to high concentrations in wildlife species essential to the cultural identity and subsistence of Arctic populations. Our objective was to characterize the distribution and exposure determinants of PFAAs among Nunavik Inuit adults. The study included up to 1322 Nunavik residents aged 16–80 years who participated in the Qanuilirpitaa? 2017 Nunavik Inuit Health Survey (Q2017). Plasma concentrations were compared to those the general Canadian population using data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey Cycle 5 (2016–2017). Associations between plasma concentrations of nine PFAAs, determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and sociodemographic factors and traditional activity participation were examined using multiple linear regression models. Overall exposure to PFAAs was twice as high compared to the general Canadian population and less regulated perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) concentrations were 7-fold higher, and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) concentrations were 4-fold higher. Males had higher concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), whereas females had higher concentrations of PFDA and PFUnDA. PFAAs concentrations increased with age and were highest among those aged 60+ years. PFNA and PFOA concentrations followed a J-shaped pattern: those aged 16–29 years had higher concentrations than those aged 20–29 and 30–39 years. Ungava Bay generally had lower concentrations of all PFAAs congeners compared to Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, with the exception of PFNA, which tended to have the lowest concentration in Hudson Strait. PFAAs concentrations were highly associated with hunting activity, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and drinking water from environmental sources. The results highlight the importance of characterizing PFAAs exposure sources in Arctic communities and provide further evidence for the long-range transport of long-chain PFAAs and their precursors that necessitate international action. © 2022 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136797,PFAS;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Canada;Adolescent;Arctic;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;plasma;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;perfluoro compound;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;solid phase extraction;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;blood level;human;Adult;middle aged;Poly-fluoroalkyl substance;adolescent;major clinical study;blood sampling;drinking water;Potable water;chemical analysis;perfluorononanoic acid;Perfluorononanoic acids;Quebec [Canada];Plasma concentration;Surveys;Population statistics;young population;acid;Hudson Bay;indigenous population;waist circumference;smoking;Nunavik;Acid concentrations;Exposure determinants;Hudson Strait;Indigenous;information dissemination;Inuit;Linear regression;multiple linear regression analysis;omega 3 fatty acid;sociodemographics;Ungava Bay,NA,NA

The presence of PFAS and Hg in the tissues of animals that are harvested by rural and Indigenous Alaskans is of great concern, yet fish in Arctic Alaska have not previously been assessed for concentrations of PFAS. Fish species of subsistence and recreational importance were collected from nearshore Beaufort and Chukchi Sea, Alaska habitats and assessed for PFAS and total mercury concentrations [THg]. We found multiple PFAS compounds present at low levels (<3 μg/kg) in the muscle tissue of inconnu, broad whitefish, Dolly Varden char, Arctic flounder, saffron cod, humpback whitefish, and least cisco. In addition, [THg] levels in these fish were well below levels triggering local fish consumption guidelines (<170 μg/kg). These initial results indicate no evidence of the Alaska Arctic nearshore fish species examined as an avenue of PFAS or Hg exposure to people who harvest them.

Five harbors in the eastern part of Norway, six harbors in the western part and four harbours in the northern part. A total of 200 samples were analyzed for 16 PFAS. Determination of PFAS were carried out by LC-MS/MS following sample clean up by solid phase extraction and ultracentrifugation. The predominating PFAS was PFOS, which was found to be higher than the level of quantification (1.5 μg kg-1 wet weight) in 72% of the samples. The highest level of PFOS found was 21.8 μg kg-1 wet weight in a sample from Kragerø in the eastern part of Norway. A significantly higher level of PFOS was found in the eastern fjords and harbors compared to fjords and harbors in the western and northern part of Norway. Within the northern fjords and harbors elevated PFOS levels were found in Narvik, which may indicate a local source there.

Understanding the human and ecological health consequences of environmentally-relevant exposures to persistent CECs, particularly as complex mixtures, is essential. Surface water and a limited number of sediment samples were collected over two years (Spring and Fall 2018-2019) at multiple locations in the Lake Huron to Lake Erie corridor to investigate more than 150 CECs. Surface water was analyzed for pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Sediment was analyzed for PFAS. Fifty compounds were detected at ng/L or ng/kg levels. Synthetic sweeteners accounted for 55.7% of the cumulative concentration of all compounds detected across sampling events, followed by pesticides (27.5%), pharmaceuticals (11.7%), and stimulants (3.5%), with 14 compounds consistently detected: acesulfame-potassium, sucralose, sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, lidocaine, atenolol, gemfibrozil, iohexol, atrazine, diaminochlorotriazine, deethyl-atrazine, deisopropylatrazine, 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and caffeine. Compound mixtures became increasingly complex downstream and indicated that the downstream Lake Huron to Erie corridor is wastewater effluentdominated, whereas the aquatic environment associated with Lake St. Clair is influenced by a mixed urban, suburban, and agricultural landscape. These results will inform follow-up studies on persistent contaminant mixtures and multiple stressors, and offer science-based priorities and evaluation objectives for natural resource and public health agencies/initiatives.

However, these also include wastewater treatment plants, which may pose a pollution risk to the wildlife using them. We studied two long-distance Arctic-breeding migratory shorebird species, curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea, n = 69) and red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis, n = 103), while on their Australian non-breeding grounds using an artificial wetland at a wastewater treatment plant (WTP) and a natural coastal wetland. We compared pollutant exposure (elements and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances/PFASs), disease (avian influenza), physiological status (oxidative stress) of the birds at the two locations from 2011 to 2020, and population survival from 1978 to 2019. Our results indicated no significant differences in blood pellet pollutant concentrations between the habitats except mercury (WTP median: 224 ng/g, range: 19–873 ng/g; natural wetland: 160 ng/g, 22–998 ng/g) and PFASs (total PFASs WTP median: 85.1 ng/g, range: <0.01–836 ng/g; natural wetland: 8.02 ng/g, <0.01–85.3 ng/g) which were higher at the WTP, and selenium which was lower at the WTP (WTP median: 5000 ng/g, range: 1950–34,400 ng/g; natural wetland: 19,200 ng/g, 4130–65,200 ng/g). We also measured higher blood o,o′-dityrosine (an indicator of protein damage) at the WTP. No significant differences were found for adult survival, but survival of immature birds at the WTP appeared to be lower which could be due to higher dispersal to other wetlands. Interestingly, we found active avian influenza infections were higher in the natural habitat, while seropositivity was higher in the WTP, seemingly not directly related to pollutant exposure. Overall, we found limited differences in pollutant exposure, health and survival of the shorebirds in the two habitats. Our findings suggest that appropriately managed wastewater treatment wetlands could provide a suitable alternative habitat to these migratory species, which may aid in curbing the decline of shorebird populations from widespread habitat loss. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166309,PFAS;Pollution;Birds;PFASs;Article;Blood;concentration (parameter);Ecosystems;environmental chemical;environmental exposure;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;survival;pollution monitoring;pollution exposure;adult;migrant bird;oxidative stress;Toxicity;migratory species;copper;lead;zinc;blood;chemical analysis;animal dispersal;mercury;pollution effect;Australia;phosphorus;selenium;pollution;Wastewater treatment;wastewater treatment plant;waste water treatment plant;sampling;habitat;biological uptake;Pollutant exposures;pollution incidence;health status;wader;habitat selection;population decline;arsenic;manganese;magnesium;iron;animal health;wetland;strontium;per;Sewage pumping plants;Waste water treatment plants;Water treatment plants;poly fluoroalkyl substance;wastewater treatment;Artificial wetland;avian influenza;Avian influenza;Calidris ferruginea;Calidris ruficollis;coastal wetland;element;habitat loss;immaturity;Natural wetland;Population survival;Reclamation;shorebird;Shorebird;Shorebirds;Wetland habitats;Wetlands,NA,NA

ACE-Asia provided a unique opportunity to compare different sampling techniques for collecting carbonaceous aerosols. In this paper detailed comparisons between filter-based carbonaceous aerosol sampling methods are made. The majority of organic carbon (OC) present on a backup quartz fiber filter (QFF) in an undenuded-filter sampler resulted from the adsorption of native gaseous OC rather than OC evaporated from collected particles. The level of OC on a backup QFF placed behind a QFF was lower than the level present on a backup QFF placed behind a Teflon membrane filter (TMF) indicating that gas/filter equilibrium may not be achieved in some QFF front and backup filter pairs. Gas adsorption artifacts can result in a 20-100% overestimation of the ambient particle-phase OC concentration. The gas collection efficiency of XAD-coated and carbon-impregnated filter-lined denuders were not always 100%, but, nonetheless, such denuders minimize gas adsorption artifacts. The median fraction of particle-phase OC that is estimated to evaporate from particles collected by denuder-filter samplers ranged from 0 to 0.2; this value depends on the sampler configuration, chemical composition of the OC, and sampling conditions. After properly correcting for sampling artifacts, the measured OC concentration may differ by 10% between undenuded- and denuder-filter samplers. Uncorrected, such differences can be as large as a factor two, illustrating the importance of sampling configurations in which gas adsorption or evaporation artifacts are reduced or can be corrected.

The IRMS was interfaced with the IRGA via a stainless steel capillary inserted 0.5 m into the sample air outlet tube of the IRGA (forming an open split), a gas-tight pump, and a sample loop attached to the eight-port Valco valve of the continuous-flow interface. Air was pumped through the 0.25-mL sample loop at 10 mL s-1 (a flushing frequency of 40 Hz). Air samples were analysed at intervals of approx. 2.8 min. Whole system precision was tested in the field using air mixed from pure CO2 and CO2-free air by means of mass flow controllers. The standard deviation of repeated single measurements was 0.21-0.07%. for delta(13)C and 0.34-0.14%o for delta(18)O of CO2 in air with mixing ratios ranging between 200-800 mumol mol(-1). The CO2 peak area measured by the IRMS was proportional to the CO2 mixing ratio (r(2)=1.00), allowing estimation of sample air CO2 mixing ratio from IRMS data. A 1-day long measurement cycle of CO2, delta(13)C and delta(18)O of air sampled above the grassland canopy was used to test the system for Keeling plot applications. delta(18)O exhibited a clear diurnal cycle (4parts per thousand range), but short-term (1-h interval) variability was small (average SD 0.38parts per thousand). Yet, the correlation between delta(18)O and CO2 mixing ratio was relatively weak, and this was true for both the whole data set and 1-h subsets. Conversely, the delta(13)C of all 541 samples measured during the 25.2-h interval fitted well the Keeling regression (r(2)=0.99), yielding an intercept of -27.40parts per thousand ( 0.07parts per thousand SE). Useful Keeling regressions (r(2)>0.9, average r(2)=0.96) also resulted from data collected over 1-h intervals of the 12-h long twilight and dark period. These indicated that C-13 content of ecosystem respiration was approx. constant near -27.6parts per thousand. The precision of the present system is similar to that of current techniques used in ecosystem studies which employ flask sampling and a laboratory-based CF-IRMS. Sampling (and measurement) frequency is greatly increased relative to systems based on flask sampling, and sampling time (0.025 s per sample) is decreased. These features increase the probability for sampling the entire CO2 range which occurs in a given time window. The system obviates sample storage problems, greatly minimises handling needs, and allows extended campaigns of high frequency sampling and analysis with minimal attendance.

Both are environmentally persistent and found in the serum of wildlife and humans. PFOS and PFOA are developmentally toxic in laboratory rodents. Exposure to these chemicals in utero delays development and reduces postnatal survival and growth. Exposure to PFOS on the last 4 days of gestation in the rat is sufficient to reduce neonatal survival. PFOS and PFOA are weak agonists of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARα). The reduced postnatal survival of neonatal mice exposed to PFOA was recently shown to depend on expression of PPARα. This study used PPARα knockout (KO) and 129S1/SvlmJ wild type (WT) mice to determine if PPARα expression is required for the developmental toxicity of PFOS. After mating overnight, the next day was designated gestation day (GD) 0. WT females were weighed and dosed orally from GD15 to 18 with 0.5% Tween-20, 4.5, 6.5, 8.5, or 10.5 mg PFOS/kg/day. KO females were dosed with 0.5% Tween-20, 8.5 or 10.5 mg PFOS/kg/day. Dams and pups were observed daily and pups were weighed on postnatal day (PND) 1 and PND15. Eye opening was recorded from PND12 to 15. Dams and pups were killed on PND15, body and liver weights recorded, and serum collected. PFOS did not affect maternal weight gain or body or liver weights of the dams on PND15. Neonatal survival (PND1-15) was significantly reduced by PFOS in both WT and KO litters at all doses. WT and KO pup birth weight and weight gain from PND1 to 15 were not significantly affected by PFOS exposure. Relative liver weight of WT and KO pups was significantly increased by the 10.5 mg/kg dose. Eye opening of PFOS-exposed pups was slightly delayed in WT and KO on PND13 or 14, respectively.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have been detected in wild birds and are known to reduce hatching success of laboratory-exposed chicken embryos at environmentally relevant concentrations. Limited toxicity data are available regarding avian exposure to PFCs of chain lengths greater than C-8, which are of increasing environmental relevance following the recent phase-out of PFOS and PFOA. In this study, linear PFOA, perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA) and perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS) were injected into the air cell of white leghorn chicken eggs (Gallus gallus domesticus) prior to incubation to determine effects on embryo pipping success. Furthermore, mRNA expression of key genes involved in pathways implicated in PFC toxicity was monitored in liver tissue. PFOA, PFUdA or PFDS had no effect on embryonic pipping success at concentrations up to 10 mu g/g. All PFCs accumulated in the liver to concentrations greater than the initial whole-egg concentration as determined by HPLC/MSIMS. Hepatic accumulation was highest for PFOA (4.5 times) compared to PFUdA and PFDS. Cytochrome P450 1A4 and liver fatty acid binding protein mRNA expression increased after exposure to PFUdA but was only statistically significant at 10 mu g/g; several orders of magnitude higher than levels found in wild bird eggs. Based on the present results for white leghorn chickens, current environmental concentrations of PFOA, PFUdA and PFDS are unlikely to affect the hatching success of wild birds.

Eleven OPEs were comprehensively investigated for their occurrence and tissue accumulation in 15 marine fish species and their living environment matrices (seawater and sediment) from the Beibu Gulf. The OPE concentrations were statistically higher in the liver (17.6-177 ng/g ww, mean 90.9 +/- 52.1 ng/g ww) than those of muscle tissues (2.04-22.9 ng/g ww, mean 10.6 +/- 5.6 ng/g ww). Tris (phenyl) phosphate (TPHP) was the most predominant OPE congeners in fish liver, and tris(2-chloropropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were dominant OPEs in the muscle. The results suggested different OPE profiles occurred between the tissues. The median logarithmic bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of TPHP in the muscle and liver, and TCEP in muscle were higher than the regulatory benchmark value (BCF >3.7), indicating very strong bioaccumulation. Carnivorous benthic fish appear to potentially accumulate TPHP, while pelagic and omnivory fish tend to accumulate TCIPP and TCEP. Except for proteins and phospholipids, no significant relationships were found between OPE levels and other biological properties of the studied fish. The results implied that the species-specific accumulation of OPEs mainly attributed to habitat and feeding habit rather than the difference of biochemical composition among species. Metabolism may have a significant effect on the bioaccumulation of OPEs in marine fish.

To date, prior studies have focused on legacy persistent chlorinated pollutants (POPs), while the effects of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been poorly documented. Here, we investigated the associations among PFAS congeners, absolute telomere length (cross-sectional approach), and telomere dynamics (rate of telomere length change over time, longitudinal approach) in one of the most contaminated arctic top predators, the glaucous gull Larus hyperboreus from Svalbard. We further estimated the effect of PFAS on apparent survival rates and re-sighting probabilities using a 10-year capture/recapture dataset (2010-2019). We found that birds exposed to higher concentrations of perfluorononadecanoate (PFNA) (median of 1565 pg/mL of ww in males and 1370 pg/mL of ww in females) and perfluorotetradecanoate (PFTeDA) (median of 370 pg/mL of ww in males and 210 pg/mL of ww in females) showed the slowest rate of telomere shortening. We also found that high blood concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) (median of 120 pg/mL of ww in males and 150 pg/mL of ww in females) and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) (median of 495 pg/mL of ww in males and 395 pg/mL of ww in females) were positively associated with higher re-sighting probabilities and apparent survival in males but not in females. Our work is the first to report an association between single PFAS compounds and telomeres, and the first to link PFAS exposure with survival probabilities, suggesting that the effect of PFAS exposure might be more tied to the type of compound rather than the total concentration of PFAS.

Therefore, Cl-PFESAs are equally recalcitrant as PFOS in addition to being more sorptive, thus with a higher bioaccumulation potential for a similar alkyl chain length. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.8b02913,Biochemistry;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Article;Sulfonic Acids;Ether;Ethers;Adsorption;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;bioaccumulation;Chlorine compounds;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;chlorination;alkanesulfonic acid;sulfonic acid derivative;adsorption;soil;water;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;Soil;Soils;aqueous solution;ether derivative;organic compound;biodegradation;soil pollutant;Soil Pollutants;inorganic compound;ether;oxidation;organic carbon;Organic carbon;temperature effect;Sorption;Oxidation;acetone;Acetone;Biodegradation;alkyl ether;sorption;9 chlorohexadecafluoro 3 oxanonane 1 sulfonate;isotherm;Persulfate oxidation;Increasing production;Bioaccumulation potential;loam soil;9 chlorooctadecafluoro 3 oxanonane 1 sulfonate;Acetone/water solutions;Aerobic biodegradation;heat treatment;Normalized sorption coefficients;oxic conditions;Oxidation potentials;Sulfones,NA,NA

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was consistently detected at the greatest concentrations in all media surveyed with the maximum concentration in water of 15 ng L-1 and in biota of 234 ng mL(-1) (fish blood). A general ascending order of PFAS concentration of water < sediment < plankton < crucian carp tissues < mandarin fish tissues was found. Except for the Nakdong River and Yeongsan River, the sum PFAS concentrations in water samples were below 10 ng L-1. The PFOS and perfluorooctanoic add (PFOA) concentrations in water did not exceed levels for acute and/or chronic effects in aquatic organisms. High concentrations of long chain perfluorocarboxylates (LCPFCAs) were found in sediment samples. PFOS, perfluoroundecanoic add (PFUnA), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) accounted for 94-99% of the total PFASs concentration in fish tissues. The mean ratios of PFAS concentration between fish blood and fish liver were above 2 suggesting higher levels in blood than in liver. Significant positive correlations (r> 0.80, p < 0.001) were observed between PFOS concentration in blood and liver tissues of both crucian carp and mandarin fish. This result suggests that blood can be used for non-lethal monitoring of PFOS in fish. Overall, the rank order of mean bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of PFOS in biota was; phytoplankton (196 L/kg) < zooplankton (3233 L/kg) < crucian carp liver (4567 L/kg) < crucian carp blood (11,167 L/kg) < mandarin liver (24,718 L/kg) < mandarin blood (73,612 L/kg).

The exposure is mainly through traditional food intake, including marine mammals and seabirds. The present study aimed to follow up on POP concentrations (organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs)) and relations to lifestyle and diet of the mothers included in the Greenlandic ACCEPT cohort (3–5 years after inclusion in 2013–15) and to include the children's fathers. This new data collection in 2019–20 included blood samples for measurement of POP concentrations and lifestyle and food frequency questionnaires from 101 mothers and 76 fathers aged 24–55 years living in Nuuk, Sisimiut, and Ilulissat, Greenland. The mothers' intra-individual median percentage decrease in POP concentrations from inclusion to this follow-up (3–5 years later) was 16–58%, except for mirex (0% change). Median concentrations of POPs were 1.4–4.6 times higher in fathers than in mothers. The POPs differed by residential town with generally higher concentrations in Ilulissat compared to Sisimiut and Nuuk. We report, for the first time, novel HFRs in human samples from Greenland. However, concentrations were low and only dechlorane plus (with its anti-isomer) was detected in >50% of the samples. Most POPs correlated positively with age and n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio. The lipophilic POPs correlated positively with the percentage of life lived in Greenland, whereas few POPs correlated positively with BMI, income (personal and household), education, and alcohol intake. The POPs generally associated positively with the intake of marine mammals, seabirds, and dried fish, while few POPs associated positively with Greenlandic fish intake. In contrast, POPs generally associated negatively with imported meat products intake. The study findings may be of interest for future dietary recommendations in Greenland.

However, these systems are subject to severe contamination from anthropogenic sources. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), are among the contaminants that have received substantial attention, primarily due to abundant applications, environment persistence, and potential threats to ecological and human health. Understanding the environmental behavior of these contaminants in shallow freshwater lake environments using a modeling approach is therefore critical. Here, we characterize the fate, transport and transformation of both PFOA and PFOS in the fifth largest freshwater lake in China (Chaohu) during a two-year period (2013-2015) using a fugacity-based multimedia fate model. A reasonable agreement between the measured and modeled concentrations in various compartments confirms the model's reliability. The model successfully quantifies the environmental processes and identifies the major sources and input pathways of PFOA and PFOS to the Chaohu water body. Sensitivity analysis reveals the critical role of nonlinear Freundlich sorption, which contributes to a variable fraction of the model true uncertainty in different compartments (8.1%-93.6%). Through additional model scenario analyses, we further elucidate the importance of nonlinear Freundlich sorption that is essential for the reliable model performance. We also reveal the distinct composition of emission sources for the two contaminants, as the major sources are indirect soil volatilization and direct release from human activities for PFOA and PFOS, respectively. The present study is expected to provide implications for local management of PFASs pollution in Lake Chaohu and to contribute to developing a general model framework for the evaluation of PFASs in shallow lakes.

Currently, potential molecular mechanisms underlying these toxicological phenomena require further studies. To address this gap in the literature, we used whole transcriptome microarrays to being to address the potential molecular mechanisms underlying developmental toxicity of TCS and PFOS on zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 300 μg/L TCS and 500 μg/L PFOS from 4 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Phenotypically, the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos was significantly reduced after TCS exposure at 72 hpf. Additionally, body length was significantly decreased in the TCS treatment group at 120 hpf. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that lipid metabolism, steroid metabolism, and organ development-related biological processes were significantly enriched in TCS- and PFOS-treated zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, signaling network analysis indicated that the steroid biosynthesis process was the most significant biological process disrupted by TCS in 120 hpf zebrafish embryos, while organ development was the most significant biological process disrupted by PFOS exposure. Our findings enhance the understanding of the specific types of embryotoxicity elicited by TCS and PFOS, and also provide information that can be used to inform future mechanistic studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA,10.1007/s11356-021-14527-9,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Transcriptome;animal;fluorocarbon;chemical substance;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;developmental biology;gene expression;genetics;genome;embryo;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;zebra fish;Zebrafish;nonmammalian embryo;cyprinid;Danio rerio;transcriptome;triclosan;Embryo;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Zebrafish embryos;Nonmammalian;Endocrine-disrupting chemicals;exploration;Genome microarrays;Triclosan;Gene Expression;Genomics;Genome,NA,NA

Studies suggest that fish consumption may be a source of human exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Most PFC fish tissue literature focuses on marine fish and waters outside of the United States (U.S.). To broaden assessments in U.S. fish, a characterization of PFCs in freshwater fish was initiated on a national scale using an unequal probability design during the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) 2008-2009 National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) and the Great Lakes Human Health Fish Tissue Study component of the 2010 EPA National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA/GL). Fish were collected from randomly selected locations-164 urban river sites and 157 nearshore Great Lake sites. The probability design allowed extrapolation to the sampled population of 17,059km in urban rivers and a nearshore area of 11,091km2 in the Great Lakes. Fillets were analyzed for 13 PFCs using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that PFOS dominated in frequency of occurrence, followed by three other longer-chain PFCs (perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, and perfluorododecanoic acid). Maximum PFOS concentrations were 127 and 80ng/g in urban river samples and Great Lakes samples, respectively. The range of NRSA PFOS detections was similar to literature accounts from targeted riverine fish sampling. NCCA/GL PFOS levels were lower than those reported by other Great Lakes researchers, but generally higher than values in targeted inland lake studies. The probability design allowed development of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) to quantify PFOS concentrations versus the sampled population, and the application of fish consumption advisory guidance to the CDFs resulted in an estimation of the proportion of urban rivers and the Great Lakes that exceed human health protection thresholds. © 2014 .",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.126,Fluorocarbons;Rivers;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;United States;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;chemistry;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;fish;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;water pollution;high performance liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;quantitative analysis;Perfluorinated compounds;water sampling;food safety;water contamination;Water Pollution;metabolism;food intake;health hazard;organofluorine;Great Lakes;Great Lakes [North America];lake;Lakes;river;probability;Fishes;concentration (parameters);Water Pollutants;statistics;Chemical;freshwater fish;Fish tissue;freshwater;Great lakes;numerical data;Probabilistic survey;survey;Urban river;Urban rivers,NA,NA

In this study, a method was developed for the determination of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) isomers in biosolids, biosolids-amended soils and plants using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS). The separation efficiencies of two chromatographic columns and extraction capacities of different methods were tested. Compared with the C18 column (ACQUITY UPLC BEH Shield RP18 column), the column with an alkyl perfluorinated C8 stationary phase (Epic FO LB column), in combination with the distinct MS/MS transitions of analytes, allowed better separation of most isomers. The ion-pair extraction method showed more effective matrix separation than that of the alkaline digestion method, with recoveries ranging from 79.6-105% for biosolids, 80.4-116% for soils, and 68.0-114% for plant tissues. The method detection limits ranged from 10 to 55, 3–13, and 8–58 pg/g dry weight for biosolids, soil, and plants, respectively. This method was applied successfully to quantify individual isomers in biosolids, biosolids-amended soils and plants. Six PFOA, eight PFOS, and two PFHxS isomers were found in the samples, with linear isomers being the dominant species. Further analysis revealed that the translocation potentials of branched isomers within plants were higher than those of linear isomers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.09.036,Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Chromatography;High Pressure Liquid;Spectrometry;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;comparative study;controlled study;chemistry;digestion;Extraction;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;high performance liquid chromatography;procedures;solid phase extraction;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;Risk assessment;separation technique;soil;ultra performance liquid chromatography;priority journal;Soil;Soils;chemical analysis;limit of detection;Silicon compounds;analysis;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;maize;statistical model;plant leaf;reproducibility;Reproducibility of Results;Isomers;Limit of Detection;Linear Models;isomer;soil pollutant;Soil Pollutants;concentration (parameters);High performance liquid chromatography;Drug products;plant;Separation;Isomer;Isomerism;Chromatographic column;Plants (botany);Method detection limits;Plants;Plant;plant root;biosolid;isomerism;Ultra-high performance liquid chromatographies;soil amendment;plant tissue;Biosolids;ion pair extraction;Biological materials;Biosolid;chromatography by stationary phase;Separation efficiency;UHPLC–MS/MS;Mass Spectrometry,NA,NA

In this study, two kinds of Mg-Al-layered double hydroxides (namely LDH-1 and 2) were synthesized using hydrothermal and dry grinding methods and used to adsorb PFOA from aqueous solution. The kinetic study revealed that a pseudo-2nd order model was the best method for describing the kinetics of sorption, which could emphasize the chemical interaction between PFOAs and LDHs. Among the models tested, the Freundlich model was the best fit for the sorption isotherms. The removal rates of PFOA adsorption by LDH-1 and LDH-2 were 90% and 98.9%, respectively, in the lowest time compared with similar past studies using different adsorbents. The currently synthesized LDHs showed the least equilibrium time, without thermal treatment and the need for activation.

These species were selected for their characteristic feeding behaviour and their importance to local human fish consumption. DDTs were the predominant organohalogenated contaminants in all species, with the p,p'-DDE contributing to more than 90% to the total DDTs. Other OCPs, such as hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers, chlordanes and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were found at much lower levels in all five species. The levels of PCBs and PBDEs (on wet weight basis) were lower than in similar species from European or American freshwater systems. PBDE data were measured for the first time in fish species from Turkish environment. Lipid-based concentrations of OCPs, PCBs and PBDEs were higher in wels than in the other species and this was related to its piscivorous feeding mode and to its higher lipid content. Contrarily, concentrations of pollutants in nose-carp were the lowest, in agreement with its more herbivorous diet. A preferential accumulation in muscle compared to liver was observed for all OCPs, PCBs, and PBDEs in wels and carp, while in nose-carp, a preferential accumulation in liver was observed only for PBDEs, p,p'-DDT and PCBs.

In this paper, three freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates with different foraging modes were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of eight perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCA), three perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSA), and three fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTS) at varying divalent cation concentrations of magnesium (Mg2+) and calcium (Ca2+). Divalent cations can impact PFAS partitioning to solids, especially to sediments, at higher concentrations. Sediment dwelling worms (Lumbriculus variegatus), epibenthic grazing snails (Physella acuta), and sediment-dwelling filter-feeding bivalves (Elliptio complanata) were selected due to their unique foraging modes. Microcosms were composed of synthetic sediment, culture water, macroinvertebrates, and PFAS and consisted of a 28-day exposure period. L. variegatus had significantly higher PFAS bioaccumulation than P. acuta and E. complanata, likely due to higher levels of interactions with and ingestion of the contaminated sediment. “High Mg2+” (7.5 mM Mg2+) and “High Ca2+” (7.5 mM Ca2+) conditions generally had statistically higher bioaccumulation factors (BAF) than the “Reference Condition” (0.2 mM Ca2+ and 0.2 mM Mg2+) for PFAS with perfluorinated chain lengths greater than eight carbons. Long-chain PFAS dominated the PFAS profiles of the macroinvertebrates for all groups of compounds studied (PFCA, PFSA, and FTS). These results indicate that the study organism has the greatest impact on bioaccumulation, although divalent cation concentration had observable impacts between organisms depending on the environmental conditions. Elevated cation concentrations in the microcosms led to significantly greater bioaccumulation in the test organisms compared to the experimental reference conditions for long-chain PFAS. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121938,"Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;Article;Carboxylation;Bioaccumulation;Carboxylic Acids;ecosystem;Ecosystem;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;bioaccumulation;bioavailability;hydrogen bond;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;environmental management;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;solid phase extraction;sulfonic acid derivative;water;carboxylic acid;environmental impact assessment;Housing;polyfluoroalkyl substance;chemical analysis;foraging;organofluorine;sediment;calcium;freshwater ecosystem;chemical structure;degradation;Sediments;physical chemistry;fresh water;Water;Molluscs;Positive ions;Bioavailability;cation;Fresh Water;magnesium;Alkanesulfonates;Water Pollutants;conductance;Chemical;Aquatic ecosystems;Fate;Sulphonates;transport;macroinvertebrate;Ca 2+;Calcium compounds;calcium ion;Cation concentrations;Cations;Divalent;divalent cation;Divalent cation;Environmental relevance;foraging behavior;inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry;Lumbriculus variegatus;Magnesium compounds;magnesium ion;perfluoroalkyl carboxylate derivative;perfluoroalkyl sulfonate derivative;PFAS profiles;Physella acuta;Polyfluoroalkyl substance profile;Uptake mechanism;Cations, Divalent",NA,NA

The method was based on extraction of target compounds from homogenised samples into the solvent mixture used as mobile phase in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), i.e. methanol/water (50:50; 2 mM ammonium acetate). The extract was filtered and directly injected into a HPLC/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) system. Quantification was performed using 7H-perfluoroheptanoic acid as internal standard and a calibration standard solution dissolved in sample extract for each matrix type (matrix-matched calibration standard). The method is very time and cost efficient. Except for long-chain compounds and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (which cannot be covered by this method), recoveries were between 60% and 115% and method detection limits were in the range 0.04-1.3 ng/g wet weight. Blank values could be neglected with the exception of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). One of the major challenges in PFAS analysis is ionisation disturbance by co-eluting matrix in the ion source of the mass spectrometer. Both matrix and analyte specific signal enhancement and suppression was observed and quantified. Repeated extractions (n = 3) gave relative standard deviations (RSD) < 35% for all PFAS. Accuracy was examined by comparing the screening method to the generally applied ion pair extraction (IPE) method. PFAS concentration values of a glaucous gull liver sample deviated by less than 30% for the two methods, provided that matrix-matched calibration standards were employed in both methods.

PFOS is a widespread environmental contaminant that is found in a great diversity of wildlife species with more elevated tissue concentrations in animals from populated and industrialized areas. In this study we determined the PFOS accumulation in blood and livers of a small songbird, the great tit (Parus major), in the vicinity of a large fluorochemical plant in Antwerp, Belgium. PFOS concentrations ranged from 553 ng/g to 11359 ng/g in liver and ranged from 24 to 1625 ng/ml in blood, which are among the highest ever reported in free-living animals, and exceeded in almost all birds the hepatic benchmark concentrations for the protection of avian species [Beach SA, Newsted JL, Coady K, Giesy JP.

In this study, ten types of vegetables and three types of grain crops were collected in two open-air fields with different distances (0.3 km, 10 km) from a mega fluorochemical industrial park (FIP), China. Bioaccumulation characteristics of PFASs in light of crop types and organs were explored, followed by analyzing human exposure and risks to local residents with different age groups and dietary habits. Elevated levels of ∑PFASs were found nearby the FIP ranging from 79.9 ng/g to 200 ng/g in soils and from 58.8 ng/g to 8085 ng/g in crops. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the predominant PFAS component in soil; while shorter-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), especially perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), were the major PFAS contaminants in multiple crops, resulting from their bioaccumulation preference. Depending on the crop types, the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of ∑PFASs for edible parts varied from 0.36 to 48.0, and the highest values were found in shoot vegetables compared with those in fruit vegetables, flower vegetables, root vegetables and grain crops. For typical grains, the BAFs of ∑PFASs decreased in the order of soybean (Glycine max (Linn.) Merr.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.), possibly related to their protein and lipid content. Among specific organs in the whole plants, leaves exhibited the highest BAFs of ∑PFASs compared with corresponding roots, stems, husks or grains. With increasing carbon chain lengths of individual PFCAs (C4-C8), the logarithm of their BAFs for edible parts of various crops showed a linear decrease (0.1–1.16 log decrease per CF2 unit), and the largest decrease was observed in grains. Human exposure to PFOA via the consumption of contaminated crops represents a health risk for local residents, especially for low-age consumers or urban consumers with higher vegetable diet.

Food ingestion appears to be the primary route of exposure in the general population. For children, the contribution from dust ingestion is nearly as great as from food ingestion. Pathway-specific contributions span several orders of magnitude and exhibit considerable overlap. PK modeling suggests central tendency PFOS intakes for adults range between 1.6 and 24.2 ng/kg-bw/day, and the forward-based intake estimates are within this range. The favorable comparison reported between the forward-modeled and the back-calculated range of intake predictions lends validity to the proposed framework. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

In this paper recent results are provided of an investigation on the discovery of 12 perfluorinated surfactants (PS) in different surface and drinking waters (Skutlarek et al. 2006 a, Skutlarek et al. 2006 b). In the last years, many studies have reported ubiquitous distribution of this group of perfluorinated chemicals, especially perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the environment, particularly in wildlife animal and human samples (Giesy and Kannan 2001, Houde et al. 2006, Prevedouros et al. 2006). Perfluorinated surfactants (e.g. PFOS and PFOA) have shown different potentials for reproductory interference and carcinogenity in animal experiments as well as partly long half-lives in humans (Guruge et al. 2006, FSA UK 2006a, FSA UK 2006b, 3M 2005, OECD 2002, Yao and Zhong 2005). They possess compound-dependent extreme recalcitrance against microbiological and chemical degradation and, in addition, they show variable potentials for bioaccumulation in animals and humans (Houde et al. 2006). Methods. Surface and drinking water samples were collected from different sampling sites: Surface waters: samples taken from the rivers Rhine, Ruhr, Moehne and some of their tributaries. Further samples were taken from the Rhine-Herne-Canal and the Wesel-Datteln-Canal. Drinking waters: samples taken in public buildings of the Rhine-Ruhr area. After sample clean-up and concentration by solid-phase extraction, the perfluorinated surfactants were determined using HPLC-MS/MS. Results. All measured concentrations (sum of seven mainly detected components) in the Rhine river and its main tributaries (mouths) were determined below 100 ng/L. The Ruhr river (tributary of the Rhine) showed the highest concentration (94 ng/L), but with a completely different pattern of components (PFOA as major component), as compared with the other tributaries and the Rhine river. Further investigations along the Ruhr river showed remarkably high concentrations of PS in the upper reaches of the Ruhr river and the Moehne river (tributary of the Ruhr) (Ruhr: up to 446 ng/L, Moehne: up to 4385 ng/L). The maximum concentration of all drinking water samples taken in the Rhine-Ruhr area was determined at 598 ng/L with the major component PFOA (519 ng/L). Discussion. The surface water contaminations most likely stem from contaminated inorganic and organic waste materials (so-called 'Abfallgemisch'). This waste material was legally applied to several agricultural areas on the upper reaches of the Moehne. Perfluorinated surfactants could be detected in some suchlike soil samples. They contaminated the river and the reservoir belonging to it, likely by superficial run-off over several months or probably years. Downstream, dilution effects are held responsible for decreasing concentrations of PS in surface waters of the Moehne and the Ruhr river. In analogy to the surface water samples, PS (major component PFOA) can be determined in many drinking water samples of the Rhine-Ruhr area where the water supplies are mainly based on bank filtration and artificial recharge. Conclusions. The concentrations found in drinking waters decreased with the concentrations of the corresponding raw water samples along the flow direction of the Ruhr river (from east to west) and were not significantly different from surface water concentrations. This indicates that perfluorinated surfactants are at present not successfully removed by water treatment steps. Recommendations and Perspectives. Because of their different problematic properties (persistence, mobility, toxicity, bioaccumulation), the concentrations of specific perfluorinated surfactants and their precursors in drinking waters and food have to be minimised. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to take the initiative to establish suitable legal regulations (limitations/ban) concerning the production and use of these surfactants and their precursors. Furthermore, it is indispensable to protect water resources from these compounds. A discussion on appropriate limit values in drinking water and foodstuffs is urgently needed. Concerning the assumed soil contamination, the corresponding regulation (Bioabfall-Verordnung 1998 - Regulation on Organic Waste 1998) should be extended to allow the control of relevant organic pollutants. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).",NA,10.1065/espr2006.07.326,Fluorocarbons;PFOS;chemical pollutant;Europe;Surface-Active Agents;fluorocarbon;bioaccumulation;chemistry;water pollutant;surfactant;water pollution;soil;article;drinking water;Germany;Rhine River;Soil;Water Pollution;organofluorine;PFOA;organic pollutant;Animalia;water supply;Perfluorinated chemicals;fresh water;Eurasia;Fresh Water;river pollution;surface water;Perfluorinated surfactants;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Water Supply;Surface water;Drinking water;North Rhine-Westphalia;HPLC-MS/MS;Central Europe;Organic waste;Ruhr River;Drinking,NA,NA

Legacy PFAS pollutants such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have been more widely studied in aquatic environments. However, replacement PFAS, such as ammonium perfluoro (2-methyl-3-oxahexanoate; GenX) are increasingly being detected with little known information surrounding their toxicity. Here, Daphnia magna, a model organism for freshwater ecotoxicology was used to compare the acute sub-lethal toxicity of PFOS, PFOA, GenX, and PFAS mixtures. Using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), the targeted polar metabolic profile extracted from single Daphnia was quantified to investigate perturbations in the exposure groups versus the unexposed organisms. Multivariate statistical analyses demonstrated significant non-monotonic separation in PFOA, GenX, and PFAS mixture exposures. Sub-lethal exposure to concentrations of PFOS did not lead to significant separation in multivariate analyses. Univariate statistics and pathway analyses were used to elucidate the mode of action of PFAS exposure. Exposure to all individual PFAS led to significant perturbations in many amino acids including cysteine, histidine, tryptophan, glycine, and serine. These perturbations are consistent with biochemical pathway disruptions in the pantothenate and Coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, thiamine metabolism, histidine metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathways. Overall, the collected metabolomic data is consistent with disruptions in energy metabolism and protein synthesis as the primary mode of action of sub-lethal PFAS exposure. Secondary modes of action among individual pollutant exposures demonstrated that the structural properties (carboxylic acid vs. sulfonic acid group) may play a role in the metabolic perturbations observed. Sub-lethal exposure to PFAS mixtures highlighted a mixed response when compared to the individual pollutants (PFOS, PFOA, and GenX). Overall, this study emphasizes the niche capability of environmental metabolomics to differentiate secondary modes of action from metabolic perturbations in both single pollutant and pollutant mixtures within the same chemical class. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2022.113582,Ecotoxicology;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Chromatography;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;perfluoro compound;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;mass spectrometry;ecotoxicology;Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA);metabolism;pantothenic acid;thiamine;limit of quantitation;glycine;threonine;glutamic acid;multiple reaction monitoring;fluorination;metabolite;electrospray;correlation analysis;Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS);energy metabolism;statistical significance;metabolomics;porphyrin;Daphnia;Daphnia magna;tryptophan;biosynthesis;cysteine;arginine;serine;discriminant analysis;proline;tyrosine;adenosine phosphate;protein synthesis;Liquid;pathway analysis;partial least squares regression;dopamine;ademetionine;aminoacyl transfer RNA;coenzyme A;cytidine phosphate;glucose 6 phosphate;guanosine;guanosine phosphate;histidine;sublethal concentration;freshwater;Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS);2 methyl 3 oxahexanoate;Ammonium perfluoro(2-methyl-3-oxahexanoate) (GenX);dextro glutamic acid;dicarboxylic acid;Environmental metabolomics;glyoxylic acid;Histidine;tyramine;univariate analysis,NA,NA

In polar bears, Ursus maritimus, some individuals follow the sea ice (offshore bears) whereas others remain nearshore yearlong (coastal bears). We studied pollutant exposure in relation to space-use patterns (offshore vs coastal) in adult female polar bears from the Barents Sea equipped with satellite collars (2000-2014, n = 152). First, we examined the differences in home range (HR) size and position, body condition, and diet proxies (nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, n = 116) between offshore and coastal space-use. Second, we investigated how HR, space-use, body condition, and diet were related to plasma concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) (n = 113), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs; n = 92), and hydroxylated-PCBs (n = 109). Offshore females were in better condition and had a more specialized diet than did coastal females. PCBs, OCPs, and hydroxylated-PCB concentrations were not related to space-use strategy, yet PCB concentrations increased with increasing latitude, and hydroxylated-PCB concentrations were positively related to HR size. PFAS concentrations were 30-35% higher in offshore bears compared to coastal bears and also increased eastward.

The studies in this review consisted of spiked‐PFAS chronic toxicity experiments with perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) that evaluated apical endpoints typical of ecological risk‐based decision making (survival, growth, and development). Body mass was the most sensitive endpoint, showing clear and biologically meaningful population level adverse effect sizes (≥20% adverse effects). From these results, we recommend chronic no observed effect concentration (NOEC) screening levels of 590 µg/L for PFOS and 130 µg/L for PFOA. At or above recommended chronic lowest observed effect concentration screening levels of 1100 µg/L PFOS and 1400 µg/L PFOA, there is an increased chance of adverse biologically relevant chronic effects. Biologically relevant adverse effects were not observed for PFHxS and 6:2 FTS, so unbounded NOECs of 1300 µg/L PFHxS and 1800 µg/L 6:2 FTS are recommended. Screening levels are also provided for the concentration of PFAS in an amphibian diet, amphibian tissue, and moss substrate. In addition, we recommend bioconcentration factors that can be useful to predict concentrations of PFAS in amphibians using concentrations in water; these values are useful for food web modeling to understand risks to vertebrate wildlife that prey on amphibians. Overall, the present study provides a guide to the wealth of ecotoxicological research on PFAS conducted by our research group and highlights the need for additional work that would improve the understanding of chemical risks to amphibians.

Ingestion of PFAS from contaminated food and water results in the accumulation of PFAS in the body and is considered a key route of human exposure. Here we calculate the potential contribution of PFOS from consumption of locally caught freshwater fish to serum levels. We analyzed data for over 500 composite samples of fish fillets collected across the United States from 2013 to 2015 under the U.S. EPA's monitoring programs, the National Rivers and Streams Assessment and the Great Lakes Human Health Fish Fillet Tissue Study. The two datasets indicate that an individual's consumption of freshwater fish is potentially a significant source of exposure to perfluorinated compounds. The median level of total targeted PFAS in fish fillets from rivers and streams across the United States was 9,500 ng/kg, with a median level of 11,800 ng/kg in the Great Lakes. PFOS was the largest contributor to total PFAS levels, averaging 74% of the total. The median levels of total detected PFAS in freshwater fish across the United States were 278 times higher than levels in commercially relevant fish tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2019–2022. Exposure assessment suggests that a single serving of freshwater fish per year with the median level of PFAS as detected by the U.S. EPA monitoring programs translates into a significant increase of PFOS levels in blood serum. The exposure to chemical pollutants in freshwater fish across the United States is a case of environmental injustice that especially affects communities that depend on fishing for sustenance and for traditional cultural practices. Identifying and reducing sources of PFAS exposure is an urgent public health priority. © 2022",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2022.115165,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Rivers;chemical pollutant;Animals;Article;United States;animal;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;controlled study;animal tissue;chemical substance;chemistry;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;chemical compound;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;blood level;Perfluorinated compounds;human;serum;water;Great Lakes [North America];lake;Lakes;river;public health;pollutant source;freshwater environment;Water;Fish consumption;Water Pollutants;Chemical;freshwater fish;per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS);Fish advisories;Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS),NA,NA

Eighteen emerging and legacy PFASs and five placental vascular biomarkers were measured. Results showed that higher levels of perfluorooctanoic (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs) were detected in subchorionic placenta compared to parabasal placenta. There were significant associations of PFASs in the subchorionic placenta, but not in the serum, with placental vascular biomarkers (up to 32.5%) and lower birth size.

Mediation effects of altered placental angiopoietin-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 were evidenced on associations of adverse birth outcomes with intraplacental PFOS and 8:2 Cl-PFESA, explaining 9.5%-32.5% of the total effect. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report on differential intraplacental distribution of PFASs and placental vascular effects mediating adverse birth outcomes and provides novel insights into the placental plate-specific measurement in PFAS-associated health risk assessment. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.2c09184,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;China;Pregnancy;Placenta;female;fluorocarbon;male;controlled study;biological marker;chemical substance;chemistry;Health risks;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Chlorine compounds;Biomarkers;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;chlorination;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;sulfonic acid derivative;human;serum;newborn;blood sampling;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;polyfluoroalkyl substance;prenatal exposure;health risk;pregnancy;Prenatal exposure;birth weight;Guangdong;placenta;maternal serum;outcome assessment;Birth outcome;pregnancy outcome;cord serum;birth outcome;Per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances;per-;health risk assessment;Guangzhou;angiopoietin 2;Fetal development;mediation analysis;mediation effect;Mediation effect;vascular disruption;Vascular disruption;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A;Vascular functions;vasculotropin A;vasculotropin receptor 2,NA,NA

ΣPFASs concentrations ranged from 5.31 to 108 ng/g dw and 11.9 to 115 ng/g dw in the soil and leaf samples, respectively, and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) was dominant in both soil and leaves. The concentrations of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA), 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid (F-53B) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) were significantly higher than those of legacy PFOA and PFOS, indicating emerging alternatives were widely applied in the region. The integrated approach of PCA analysis, field investigation of relevant industrial activities in the study area, along with the Unmix model analysis quantitatively revealed that factories producing consumer products and the landfill were the major sources of PFASs in soil, accounting for 57% of total PFASs detected. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of ΣPFASs in leaves varied from 0.37 to 8.59, and higher BAFs were found in camphor leaves. The log10BAFs in all plant leaves showed a linear decrease with increasing carbon chain lengths for individual PFCAs (C4–C8). The BAF values of HFPO-DA, F-53B and 6:2 FTS were 0.01–3.39, 0.04–6.15 and 0.01–6.33, respectively. The human health risk assessment of EDIs showed a decreasing trend with the increasing carbon chain lengths of PFCAs (C4–C9), and the PFASs EDI indicated further study on the human health risk via vegetable consumption be warranted. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145731,Biochemistry;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFASs;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Bioaccumulation;China;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;carbon;Carbon;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;chemical substance;chemistry;Health risks;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;chemical compound;perfluorooctanoic acid;chlorination;pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;source apportionment;quantitative analysis;risk assessment;Risk assessment;Hexafluoropropylene oxide;oxide;human;soil;polyfluoroalkyl substance;Soil;Soils;health hazard;polymerase chain reaction;health risk;Consumer products;landfill;plant leaf;Plant Leaves;Industrial activities;Waste Disposal Facilities;waste disposal facility;soil analysis;Land fill;Chain length;Plants (botany);Carbon-chain length;Water Pollutants;Human health risk assessment;Chemical;Bioaccumulation factor;dimer;Source apportionment;soil quality;camphor;Dryobalanops;Field investigation;Landfill;leaf area;Unmix model;vegetable consumption;Humanities;Humanism,NA,NA

A validated method that is based on the use of volatile ion-pair liquid chromatography coupled to stable isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry has been developed for the simple and accurate quantitation of underivatized amino acids in biological samples. Sufficient separation of 22 underivatized amino acids was achieved on a C-18 column in 36 min using perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as mobile phase modifiers. The collisionally activated dissociation spectra of the amino acids were investigated and the transitions of [M + H](+) –> [M + H - 46](+), which are specific to a-amino acids, were used for the detection of most amino acids and their stable isotopes. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 0.10-100 mug/mL, and the detection limits were 0.03-20 pmol on column. The quantitative results by this method were compared with those by an established OPA-derivatization HPLC method in the assay of 8 human serum samples, and better recovery and precision data of this method were observed. The method was also applied to the neonatal screening for phenylketonuria (PKU) with dry blood spots, and the results were satisfactory.

These two fish species were collected in the summer 2013 in the St. Lawrence River upstream and downstream from a major WWTP, as well as in background sites (semi-remote lakes). Most of the δ15N variations for Sauger and Walleye are attributable to 1) δ15N values of the primary producers and sewage-derived particulate organic matter (SDPOM) at the base of the trophic food chain, 2) agricultural activities combined with biogeochemical processes, and 3) food web length. δ15N was significantly lower in fish collected in the effluent-mixed water masses than other sites of the St. Lawrence River, attributed to the SDPOM of the WWTP effluent. Relative to the background sites, certain PFAS were present at much higher levels in the St. Lawrence River, with profiles dominated by perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSA). However, PFSA profiles generally remained consistent along the St. Lawrence River. PFOS levels in fish from the St. Lawrence exceeded the current Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines for protecting piscivorous mammals or birds.

However, few studies have examined diet as a potential source of PFAS exposure during pregnancy. In the present cross-sectional study, we examined prenatal PFAS levels in relation to self-reported consumption of meats, dairy products, and processed foods during pregnancy. Methods: Participants were enrolled in the Chemicals in Our Bodies study, a demographically diverse pregnancy cohort in San Francisco, CA (N = 509). Diet was assessed using a self-reported interview questionnaire administered during the second trimester. Participants were asked on average how many times a day, week, or month they ate 11 different foods since becoming pregnant. Responses were categorized as at least once a week or less than once a week and foods were grouped into three categories: processed foods, dairy products, and meats. Twelve PFAS (ng/mL) were measured in second trimester serum samples. We investigated relationships between consumption of individual dairy products, meats, and processed foods and natural log-transformed PFAS using separate linear regression models adjusted for maternal age, education, race/ethnicity, and nativity. Results: Seven PFAS were detected in ≥65% of participants. Consumption of dairy milk and cheese at least once per week was moderately associated with elevated levels of perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDeA) relative to those who ate dairy products less than once week. The strongest associations observed were with PFDeA for dairy milk (β = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02, 0.39) and PFNA for cheese (β = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.41). Eating fish, poultry, and red meat at least once per week was associated with higher levels of perfluoroundecanoic acid, PFDeA, PFNA, and perflucorooctane sulfonic acid.

During pregnancy and lactation chemical body burdens may change due to the significant physiological changes that occur. Developmental exposures to some persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been linked with adverse health outcomes. Methods: First trimester maternal and cord blood plasma concentrations of several POPs including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)s and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were measured in samples from 1983 pregnant women enrolled in the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) cohort. Predictors of exposure were also identified. Results: In maternal plasma, there was >90 % detection for the perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), oxychlordane and PCB 138 and 153. Cord blood plasma had much lower detection rates with low or very limited detection for most PCBs and PBDEs. The PFASs were the most frequently detected (23-64 %) chemical class in cord plasma. In a subset of 1st and 3rd trimester paired samples, PFAS concentrations were found to be strongly correlated and had ICCs ranging from 0.64 (PFOA) to 0.83 (PFHxS). The cord:maternal plasma concentration ratios ranged from 0.14 (PFOS) to 0.87 (oxychlordane, lipid adjusted). Similar to other studies, we found parity, maternal age, income, education, smoking status, pre-pregnancy BMI and fish consumption to be significant predictors for most chemicals. Those participants who were foreign-born had significantly higher concentrations of organochlorinated pesticides and PCBs. Conclusions: In the MIREC study, multiple chemical contaminants were quantified in the plasma of pregnant women. In cord plasma PFOA had the highest detection rate.

The concentrations of the total PFASs decreased in the order of NW-PO>E-IO>SO. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the most dominant, followed by perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The PFOA concentration declined exponentially with the offshore distance, while such trend was not obvious for PFOS and other legacy PFASs, suggesting that PFOA was mainly derived from the ongoing land-based emissions, while PFOS was mainly from historical residues. 6:2 Cl-PFESA was identified (< 11.1–170 pg/L) in the oceanic waters with relatively high level at the sites near Australia. Multiple receptor models indicated that PFASs in the SO were mainly contributed by atmosphere input, while those in the NW-PO and E-IO were originated from land sources.

In livers, the amount of PFASs ranged from 3.1 to 10 µg kg−1, significantly higher than that in muscle (0.032–1.7 µg kg−1). The predominant PFASs were perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and long-chain carboxylic acids (C8–C14). Short-chain compounds (C4–C5), as well as the long-chain sulfonic acids (C9–C12), were not quantified. The contamination patterns were similar among species with few differences, suggesting the influence of species-specific accumulation. The PFAS concentrations in livers were comparable among species, while in muscle, the higher values were measured in European eel, followed by goldfish, European perch, and red swamp crayfish. The levels were generally lower than those reported for fish from Northern Italian lakes and rivers. The concentrations of regulated PFASs were lower than the maximum limits set by Regulation EU 2023/915 and did not exceed the Environmental Quality Standards (PFOS in biota).

Generally, the flange rigidity characterized by the rotation angle is a key index to evaluate the sealing tightness of flange joints. However, the rotation angle of flange is usually too small (less than 1 degrees) to monitor during the assemble and operation stages. Accordingly, a novel flexure magnifying mechanism is designed to measure the small rotation angle of flange joints under internal pressure and external bending moment. The magnification factor and calculation approach of the flexure amplification mechanism are deduced and verified by experimental data and finite element simulation. Results indicate that the proposed measuring apparatus has good performance to monitor the maximum rotation angle. It is of great interest that the measured location of the maximum rotation angle is in good agreement with that in the experiment, and the average error is 7.3%, which is acceptable for practical application. Additionally, the leakage rate at the top of flange joints slowly and almost linearly increases with the increment of external bending moment ascribing to the decrease the gasket stress near the top of flange joints.

In addition, different feather types of six individuals of Black kite (Milvus migrans) were compared for their brominated flame retardant (BFR) levels. Black kite was found to be the most contaminated species with a median (minimum-maximum) tail feather concentration of 2.4 (0.70-7.5) ng g(-1) dw for Sigma PBDEs, 1.5 (0.5-8.1) ng g(-1) dw for Sigma HBCDDs and 0.10 (<LOQ-0.1) ng g(-1) dw for BTBPE. Among unrestricted BFRs, BTBPE was detected only in Black kite and Little owl (Athene noctua), whereas BEH-TEBP and EH-TBB were not detected in any species. BDE-47 was found to be the most prevalent BFR compound in aquatic species, while BDE-99 and -153 were more abundant in terrestrial species. For HBCDDs, alpha-isomer was generally recorded as the most prevalent BFR in both terrestrial and aquatic species. The concentrations of BFRs differed significantly (all P < 0.01) among species, trophic guilds and between habitats, the latter for PBDEs only (P < 0.04), whereas differences among taxonomic affiliations and groups with different feeding regimes were not significant (P > 0.05 for both). Similarly, no significant concentration differences were observed among different feather types (all P > 0.05) suggesting their similar exposure.

Curiously, accumulation of PFAAs in plant tissues is greatest for both the short-chain and long-chain PFAAs, generating a U-shaped relationship with chain length. In the present study, the authors decouple competing mechanisms of PFAA accumulation using a hydroponic model plant system (Arabidopsis thaliana) exposed to a suite of 10 PFAAs to determine uptake, depuration, and translocation kinetics. Rapid saturation of root concentrations occurred for all PFAAs except perfluorobutanoate, the least-sorptive (shortest-chain) PFAA. Shoot concentrations increased continuously, indicating that PFAAs are efficiently transported and accumulate in shoots. Tissue concentrations of PFAAs during depuration rapidly declined in roots but remained constant in shoots, demonstrating irreversibility of the translocation process. Root and shoot concentration factors followed the U-shaped trend with perfluoroalkyl chain length; however, when normalized to dead-tissue sorption, this relationship linearized. The authors therefore introduce a novel term, the ""sorption normalized concentration factor,"" to describe PFAA accumulation in plants; because of their hydrophobicity, sorption is the determining factor for long-chain PFAAs, whereas the shortest-chain PFAAs are most effectively transported in the plant. The present study provides a mechanistic explanation for previously unexplained PFAA accumulation trends in plants and suggests that shorter-chained PFAAs may bioaccumulate more readily in edible portions.

The characteristics and main factors affecting photocatalytic PFOA and photocatalytic mechanism of BiOCl/Zn-Al hydrotalcite (B-BHZA) are systematically investigated. It is found that spherical-shaped B-BHZA possesses abundant defects and a larger surface area of 64.4 m2 g−1.

The removal rate of PFOA is over 90 % in 6 h under UV light at an optimal pH of 2, an initial concentration of 500 μg/L and a dose of dosage 0.5 g/L. The main mechanism occurs by photo-generated h+ oxidation and synergistic effects from the photocatalysis process.

Characteristic chemical shifts of different classes of PFASs can also be observed, and are useful for differentiating between classes of PFAS. The NMR spectra of PFASs with ether linkages (e.g. GenX) show characteristic reference signals for both -CF2 and -CF3 signals that are useful for detection. Notably, 19F-NMR can differentiate between PFASs, non-PFAS, and F− ions, eliminating the need for sample clean-up even for complex samples.

PFA precursors are diverse and include poly- and perfluorinated alcohols and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide derivatives. Products in which PFAs and their precursors have been used include wetting agents, lubricants, stain resistant treatments, and fire-fighting foams. The PFAs in the environment comprise two general classes: perfluoroalkyl carboxylates such as CF3(CF2)yCO2 - and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates, such as CF3 (CF2)xSO3-. The predominant PFA in biota samples from the Great Lakes is perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), but a homologous series of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, where x = 6 - 3, is also detected in most samples at lesser concentrations. The environmental behavior of most PFAs is not well studied, and our knowledge of the physicochemical properties of PFOS and PFOA is limited. Both compounds are persistent in the environment and are not expected to volatilize into the atmosphere to a significant extent, but have much greater water solubilities than similar chlorinated compounds. Concentrations of PFOS in surface waters are usually less than those of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), but PFOS accumulates in aquatic organisms to a greater extent and appears to biomagnify in the food web of the Great Lakes region. PFAs and/or their precursors have been measured in air, surface waters, sediments, aquatic invertebrates, and in the tissues of fish, fish-eating water birds, mink, otter, and other wildlife from in and around the Great Lakes. Although the sources of PFAs to the Great Lakes are not well understood, fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and perfluorooctylsulfonamides degrade to perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and PFOS, respectively, in laboratory studies. Based on preliminary and incomplete information, current concentrations of PFOS in the Great Lakes environment do not seem to be sufficient to pose a significant risk to most aquatic organisms including fish. However, the margins of safety are less for mammals such as mink and birds and when the concentrations of all PFAs are considered together, current concentrations may pose risk to some sensitive species. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",NA,10.1007/698_5_046,Surface waters;Bioaccumulation;Risk assessment;Toxicity;Fatty acids;Precursors;Fluorotelomer alcohols;Aves;Mammalia;Invertebrata;Carnivora;Mustela vison;Perfluorinated acid;Perfluorooctane sulfonamides;Food web,NA,NA

Compared with the levels upstream of the Xiaoqing River, HFPO-TA concentrations (5200-68500 ng/L) were approximately 120-1600-times higher downstream after receiving fluoropolymer plant effluent from a tributary. The riverine discharge of HFPO-TA was estimated to be 4.6 t/yr, accounting for 22% of total PFAS discharge. In the wild common carp collected downstream from the point source, HFPO-TA was detected in the blood (median: 1510 ng/mL), liver (587 ng/g ww), and muscle (118 ng/g ww). The log BCFblood of HFPO-TA (2.18) was significantly higher than that of PFOA (1.93). Detectable levels of HFPO-TA were also found in the sera of residents (median: 2.93 ng/mL).

The pharmaceuticals and personal Care Products, PPCPs, are extensively found in water environmental samples. In this group, ibuprofen and triclosan are very representative due to their persistency and ubiquity. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic drug. It is an important non-prescription drug widely used. And triclosan, an antimicrobial chemical, is considered as persistent pollutant in the environment. Industrial chemicals and pesticide are also found in waters. The perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA, very used in industry because of its chemical and thermal stability, and atrazine, an organochlorine herbicide, is extensively used in agriculture, and is included in lists of priority pollutants. The occurrence of any emerging contaminant, even at low concentrations, can lead to chronic health effects especially at highly contaminated sites, particularly when possible different effects of organic compounds mixtures could take place. Risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in environment needs toxicological information from different trophic levels, especially on non-target organisms. But the studies are usually focused on the evaluation of the effect of a single drug on each organism used. The studies about combined toxicity are very important because the organic pollutants residues found in environmental samples usually occur as mixtures, not as single contaminants and the ecotoxicity values obtained for individual substances do not provide a safe rule for mixtures. Original results of toxicological effects have been obtained for binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures (including ibuprofen) on green algae. The CI-isobologram equation was applied to obtain real toxicity data taking in account the type and level of interactions between pollutants studied. These parameters were used to carry out the risk assessment for aquatic environment due to the occurrence of ibuprofen solely and combined with other contaminants. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Here, newly identified PFAS were investigated in wild sporting fish from boreal freshwater ecosystems (background sites, 2013–2014 summer seasons), compared to fish impacted by a major AFFF release (summer 2013 and autumn 2014). Different freshwater wild sporting fish species (Esox lucius, Esox masquinongy, Micropterus dolomieu, Sander vitreus, Perca flavescens, and Semotilus corporalis, n = 74) were collected from 13 ecosystems (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) across Eastern Canada.

The analytes were concentrated using a solid-phase extraction/ultrasonic-assisted extraction procedures and then selectively quantified by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) using electrospray ionization. In most of the wastewater samples investigated, the dominant compounds were perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctansulfonate acid (PFOS), with the maximum concentration range between 105 and 316 ng/L in influents, 14.8–31.3 ng/L in effluents and removal efficiencies higher than 80 % for all selected PFAS compounds. In sewage sludge samples, PFOA and PFOS were the majority substances, with values up to 35.8 ng/g dw for PFOA and 27.8 ng/g dw for PFOS. PFOA and PFOS achieved the maximum levels by estimating mass loading and emission levels. As a result, 237 mg/day/1000 people of PFOA and 95.5 mg/day/1000 people of PFOS are entering daily in the WWTPs, while up to 31 mg/day/1000 people of PFOA and up to 13.6 mg/day/1000 people of PFOS are discharged daily into the natural emissaries. Human risk assessment shows that PFOA and PFOS are low to high risk for all age and gender categories. Children are the most exposed to PFOA and PFOS contamination in drinking water. Environmental risk assessment reveals that PFOA exhibits a low risk for some insect species, PFOS - a low risk for freshwater shrimps and a medium risk for midges, while perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFNuDA) could have a low to medium risk for midges.

Fish muscle tissue samples (n = 80) were taken from six lakes across Sweden and analysed using solid-liquid extraction followed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). PFAS levels in the lakes were affected by atmospheric deposition in relatively pristine areas with no direct point source of PFAS in the catchment. PFTeDA, PFUnDA, PFTriDA, PFDoDA, PFDA, PFOS and 6:2 FTSA were detected with a frequency between 68% and 99% and were included in the statistical evaluation. Sigma PFAS differed between lakes (ANOVA: F = 50.6, p < 0.0001): fish from lakes in southern Sweden (lake Gardsjon, 58 degrees 03'N, 12 degrees 01'E) showed elevated levels of PFAS, with a maximum Sigma PFAS of 3.4 ng g(-1) wet weight (ww) (mean +/- SD: 0.99 +/- 0.63 ng ww), while the lowest levels were found in lake Bjorntjarn (031 +/- 0.08 ng g(-1), ww) in northern Sweden (63 degrees 54'N, 18 degrees 51'E). PFOS was most abundant in perch from south-western Sweden, while other long-chain perfluorocarbons (>10 carbon atoms) were relatively more abundant in lakes in northern Sweden. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated that concentrations of PFAS in perch did not show any relation to fish size or age and were negatively correlated with trophic position of the fish (delta N-15). It was also found that Sigma PFAS were negatively correlated with both latitude and altitude.

Among these pollutants, halogenated persistent organic pollutants and new emerging contaminants have cause great concern due to their toxicity, persistence, bioaccumulation and biomagnification capacity and/or their high mobility in the environment. Moreover, their hazardous effects are manifested even at trace levels, thus requiring very selective and sensitive analytical methodologies to face their detection in environmental samples. In this sense, atmospheric pressure ionization (API) sources such as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) for both liquid-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) could offer great advantages to overcome the limitations observed in the determination of these group of substances. In the present Thesis, the feasibility of these ionization sources, especially APPI, has been evaluated to develop sensitive and selective LC-API-MS and GC-API-MS methodologies to monitor relevant halogenated contaminants in environmental samples. API sources have been thoroughly tested to achieve an efficient ionization of neutral per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (nPFAS). The ionization behavior of these compounds was assessed through optimization of the mobile phase composition, the addition of additives or dopants as well as critical ion source working parameters. These studies have led to highly selective and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-high- resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) methodologies (up to fg injected on column).

In the present work, we exposed earthworm Eisenia fetida to sub-lethal levels of arsenate (As(V)), PFOS, and their mixture for 30 days. Multiple biomarker responses and bioaccumulation of the two toxicants in the organisms were analyzed to assess the joint toxicity of As(V) and PFOS. Bioaccumulation analysis results demonstrated that the coexistence of As(V) and PFOS in soil could increase the bioavailability of As(V) while decreasing the bioavailability of PFOS. As the level of exposure increased, significant variations were observed in all of the biomarkers analyzed, indicating growth inhibition and oxidative damage. The multiple biomarker responses were summarized by using the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) index, and significant dose–response relationships were found in treatments of As(V), PFOS and As(V)/PFOS mixture. Then the toxic interaction between As(V) and PFOS was assessed by combining IBR and two mixture toxicity indices, Effect Addition Index (EAI) and Concentration Addition Index (CAI). Results showed that the joint toxicity of As(V) and PFOS depended on the exposure concentration of As(V). The combined pollution of PFOS with lower concentration of As(V) led to synergistic interaction at the whole range of effect levels, while that with higher concentration of As(V) resulted in the toxicity interaction changing from antagonism to synergism as the effect level increased. As(V) was the main toxicant that caused adverse effects on earthworm biomarkers and affected the joint toxicity of As(V)/PFOS mixture. This study, for the first time, provides valuable toxicological data for the risk evaluation of combined toxicity of As(V) and PFOS in the soil environment. Moreover, this work indicates that the integration of IBR index and EAI/CAI could be an effective and practical method for the characterization of toxicity interaction within binary mixture systems. © 2022 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109521,PFOS;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Bioaccumulation;Binary mixtures;Mixture toxicity;bioaccumulation;Biomarkers;Toxicity;Soils;Soil pollution;Arsenic;Eisenia fetida;Integrated biomarker response;antagonism;arsenate;Combined toxicity;Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR);Joint toxicity;Multiple biomarkers;Soil environment;Toxicity index;Sulfones,NA,NA

Whole-body concentrations were examined every 10 d during constant aqueous exposure to targeted concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 μg/L for 40 d and for 30 d during depuration. Effects of PFAS exposure on length and development were also examined. Rapid uptake led to steady state concentrations by 10 d for most exposures. PFOS accumulated to the highest levels with whole-body bioconcentration factor (BCF) values at 40 d ranging from 19.6 to 119.3. The remaining PFASs were not found to bioconcentrate (BCF < 1.0 at 40 d). Furthermore, some BCF values decreased during the exposure phase, suggesting dilution due to growth and/or changes in toxicokinetics over ontogeny. During depuration, half-lives ranged from 1.2 to 3.3 d for all compounds. All PFASs tended to induce developmental delays, though statistical significance was only seen for PFOS and PFHxS.

The trend of BSAF values and number of carbon atoms in the perfluoroalkyl chain of perfluorinated carboxylates varied among the three species but was similar for perfluorinated sulfonates. Differences in the dominant pathways of exposure (e.g., water, sediment ingestion) likely explain a large proportion of the variation in accumulation observed across the three species. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Potential reproductive effects of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) have been reported in mice, rats and water birds. PFOS and PFOA were also confirmed developing toxicants towards zebrafish embryos; however, the reported effect concentrations were contradictory. Polyfluorinated alkylated phosphate ester surfactants (including FC807) are precursor of PFOS and PFOA; however, there is no published information about the effects of FC807 and PFNA on zebrafish embryos. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of these four PFCs on zebrafish embryos. Normal fertilized zebrafish embryos were selected to be exposed to several concentrations of PFOA, PFNA, PFOS or FC807 in 24-well cell culture plates. A digital camera was used to image morphological anomalies of embryos with a stereomicroscope. Embryos were observed through matching up to 96-h post-fertilization (hpf) and rates of survival and abnormalities recorded. PFCs caused lethality in a concentration-dependent manner with potential toxicity in the order of PFOS > FC807 > PFNA > PFOA based on 72-h LC50. Forty-eight-hour post-fertilization pericardial edema and 72- or 96-hpf spine crooked malformation were all observed. PFOA, PFNA, PFOS and FC807 all caused structural abnormalities using early stages of development of zebrafish. The PFCs all retarded the development of zebrafish embryos. The toxicity of the PFCs was related to the length of the PFC chain and functional groups. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",NA,10.1007/s11356-012-0977-y,PFOS;chemical pollutant;survival;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;surfactant;toxicity;embryo;morphology;waterfowl;PFOA;functional group;Aves;halogenated hydrocarbon;Spondias purpurea;phosphate;cyprinid;Danio rerio;abnormality;Developmental toxicity;In ovo;PFNA;Rattus;digital image;FC807;Mus;rodent,NA,NA

Despite being largely phased out due to concerns regarding their persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity, legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid continue to persist at high levels in the environment, posing risks to aquatic organisms. We used high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in intact zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to investigate the metabolic pathways altered by PFOS both before and after hatching (i.e., 24 and 72 h post fertilization [hpf], respectively). Assessment of embryotoxicity found embryo lethality in the parts-per-million range with no significant difference in mortality between the 24- and 72-hpf exposure groups. Metabolic profiling revealed mostly consistent changes between the two exposure groups, with altered metabolites generally associated with oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, energy production, and mitochondrial function, as well as specific targeting of the liver and central nervous system as key systems. These metabolic changes were further supported by analyses of tissue-specific production of reactive oxygen species, as well as nontargeted mass spectrometric lipid profiling. Our findings suggest that PFOS-induced metabolic changes in zebrafish embryos may be mediated through previously described interactions with regulatory and transcription factors leading to disruption of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. The present study proposes a systems-level model of PFOS toxicity in early life stages of zebrafish, and also identifies potential biomarkers of effect and exposure for improved environmental biomonitoring.

Fifty-seven sediment samples were collected in 2019, from which 15 t-PAHs and 11 e-PAHs were analyzed using GC-MSD. In addition, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in sediments were measured to evaluate associations with PAHs contamination. OC, TN, and their stable isotope ratios showed a wide range of site-specific contents and values, indicating high variation in contamination and sources. Concentrations of t-PAHs and e-PAHs in sediments ranged from 0.6 to 200,000 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) and 1.1 to 20,000 ng g(-1) dw, respectively. Hotspot sites located in Nanjing (PuKou), Taizhou (JingJiang), and Suzhou (ZhangJiaGang). PAHs contamination reflected land use type and human activity in the surrounding area. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) modeling showed that, on average (n=57), vehicle emissions were the most dominant contribution (57%), followed by petroleum (28%) and fossil fuel combustion (15%). Sites with high PAHs contamination in sediments were of severe ecological risk. Contributions to the potential risks of PAHs were most significant in the order of dibenz[a,h]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene.

However, local sources within the Arctic also contribute to the levels observed in the environment, including legacy sources and new sources that arise from activities associated with increasing commercial and industrial development. The City of Iqaluit in Frobisher Bay, Nunavut (Canada), has seen rapid population growth and associated development during recent decades yet remains a site of interest for ocean protection, where Inuit continue to harvest country food. In the present study, seven dated marine sediment cores collected in Koojesse Inlet near Iqaluit, and from sites in inner and outer Frobisher Bay, respectively, were analyzed for total mercury (THg), major and trace elements, PAHs, PCBs, and PFASs. The sedimentary record in Koojesse Inlet shows a period of Aroclor 1260-like PCB input concurrent with military site presence in the 1950–60s, followed by decades of input of pyrogenic PAHs, averaging about ten times background levels. Near-surface sediments in Koojesse Inlet also show evidence of transient local-source inputs of THg and PFASs, and recycling or continued slow release of PCBs from legacy land-based sources. Differences in PFAS congener composition clearly distinguish the local sources from long-range transport. Outside Koojesse Inlet but still in inner Frobisher Bay, 9.2 km from Iqaluit, sediments showed evidence of both local source (PCB) and long-range transport. In outer Frobisher Bay, an up-core increase in THg and PFASs in sediments may be explained by ongoing inputs of these contaminants from long-range transport. The context for ocean protection and country food harvesting in this region of the Arctic clearly involves both local sources and long-range transport, with past human activities leaving a long legacy insofar as levels of persistent organic pollutants are concerned. © 2023 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.ese.2023.100313,Mercury;Persistent organic pollutants (POPs);Arctic sediments;Per;Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs);Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs);polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs),NA,NA

To contribute to a discussion on sources of perfluorinated acid pollution, isomer profiles of perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) were determined in a diverse set of environmental and biotic samples from remote to urban locations. Analysis was conducted on the derivatized extracts using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

The perfluorononanoate (PFNA) isomer pattern varied from, only rc-PFNA, n- and iso-PFNA (isopropyl isomer), or n-PFNA and multiple branched isomers.

Relatively high total concentrations of PFAAs and their precursors were found in sprays for fabrics and textiles (<limit of quantitation (LOQ)-30000ngg-1) and car wash/coating products (<LOQ-7500ngg-1) compared to other categories, and the similar observation was found in previous studies in Norway and Germany.

As a case study, burdens for a set of PFAS were investigated for different fish species from five German freshwater sites and a Baltic Sea lagoon. PFAS concentrations were determined for composite samples of both, fillet and whole fish. On average, sum concentrations of C9–C14 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids, which will be banned in the European Union in 2023, reached 87% and 82% of the PFOS burdens in fillet and whole fish, respectively. The potential risk of several PFAS other than PFOS was assessed using a previously suggested relative potency factor approach, which is also applied for a proposed EQS revision. Only five of 36 fillet samples (mostly perch) exceeded the current EQS for PFOS alone. By contrast, all fillet samples exceeded the newly proposed draft EQS, which considers potential effects of further PFAS but also a lower tolerable intake value. Additionally, the dataset was used to derive fillet-to-whole fish conversion factors, which can be applied to assess human health risks by consumption of fillet if only whole fish concentrations are available. © 2021 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.133483,Biochemistry;Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Baltic Sea;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Bioaccumulation;Carboxylic Acids;animal;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;Health risks;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;quality control;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;risk assessment;Risk assessment;human;carboxylic acid;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;Environmental regulations;polyfluoroalkyl substance;limit of quantitation;Carboxylic acids;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids;aquatic environment;Atlantic Ocean;monitoring;European Union;environmental factor;fresh water;Water;Biota monitoring;Fresh Water;environmental quality;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Quality control;freshwater fish;Environmental quality standards;wildlife management;perch;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;Conversion factor;Water conservation;composite;freshwater;Environmental quality standard;fillet (fish);Perches;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA);Relative potencies;Relative potency factor;Water framework directive;Water Framework Directives,NA,NA

The presence of fluorochemical residues in human blood, plasma, or serum from sample populations worldwide is indicative of widespread human exposure. Previous studies demonstrated that PFOS alters fatty acid metabolism in the liver of rodents and that this leads to peroxisome proliferation. This study was undertaken to (1) confirm the effects of PFOS on rat liver, (2) identify additional target organs and systems, and (3) further explore the biochemical and molecular changes associated with PFOS exposure. The results confirmed that liver was a primary target for PFOS. Hepatomegaly, decreased serum triglycerides and cholesterol, and increased expression of the genes for acyl-coenzymeA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) and cytochrome P-450 4A22 (CYP4A22) were indicative of exposure to a peroxisome proliferator. Changes in liver fatty acid profiles included increased total monounsaturated fatty acid levels and decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as an increase in linoleic acid levels and a decrease in longer chain fatty acids. These changes were similar to those induced by relatively weak peroxisome proliferators. Disruptions in hepatic fatty acid metabolism may contribute to changes in red blood cell membranes, resulting in increased lysis and cell fragility. Serum thyroid hormone levels were decreased in PFOS-treated rats, while the kidney and cardiovascular systems were not significant targets. Residue analyses indicated that PFOS accumulation in tissues was dose dependent, appearing preferentially in the liver at lower doses but increasing in serum and other organs relative to liver at higher doses.

In the present study, PBDEs, PCBs and DDTs as well as liver histological changes were examined in common kingfisher breeding at a nature reserve (Shimentai National Nature Reserve, SNNR) near a notorious e-waste recycling site in South China. Mean Sigma PBDEs (84.9 ng/g lipid weight), Sigma PCBs (397 ng/g) and Sigma TEQs (total toxic equivalent of coplanar PCBs, 2.68 ng/g) concentrations in kingfishers from SNNR were approximately 2-, 5-, and 4-fold higher than those detected in a reference population, respectively; suggesting contamination of the e-waste-derived OHCs in SNNR. Mean Sigma DDTs concentration (2150 ng/g) in kingfishers from SNNR was also higher (similar to 2-fold) than that from the reference samples. While Sigma DDTs dominated the composition of the OHCs at both sampling sites, Sigma PCBs was also important in kingfishers from SNNR, averaging 15% of Sigma OHCs. Histological examination of the liver showed steatosis occurred in 60% of the kingfishers from SNNR. Birds with hepatic steatosis had significantly (p = 0.03) higher Sigma TEQs than those without steatosis. Similar trends were also found forSPCBs and Sigma DDTs, although it is not statistically significant. It therefore seems likely that the hepatic steatosis were associated with the relatively high body-burden of OHCs, although the possibility of other factors resulting in hepatic steatosis cannot be ruled out.

Here, we integrate recent data and perform a multi-media assessment to examine the current status and ongoing trends of PFAAs in Canada. Concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) in air, water, sediment, fish, and birds across Canada are generally related to urbanization, with elevated concentrations observed around cities, especially in southern Ontario. PFOS levels in water, fish tissue, and bird eggs were below their respective Draft Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines, suggesting there is low potential for adverse effects to the environment/organisms examined. However, PFOS in fish and bird eggs tended to exceed guidelines for the protection of mammalian and avian consumers, suggesting a potential risk to their wildlife predators, although wildlife population health assessments are needed to determine whether negative impacts are actually occurring. Long-term temporal trends of PFOS in suspended sediment, sediment cores, Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) eggs collected from Lake Ontario increased consistently from the start of data collection until the 1990s. However, after this time, the trends varied by media, with concentrations stabilizing in Lake Trout and Herring Gull eggs, and decreasing and increasing in suspended sediment and the sediment cores, respectively. For PFCAs, concentrations in suspended sediment, sediment cores, and Herring Gulls generally increased from the start of data collection until present and concentrations in Lake Trout increased until the late 1990s and subsequently stabilized. A multimedia comparison of PFAA profiles provided evidence that unexpected patterns in biota of some of the lakes were due to unique source patterns rather than internal lake processes. High concentrations of PFAAs in the leachate and air of landfill sites, in the wastewater influent/effluent, biosolids, and air at wastewater treatment plants, and in indoor air and dust highlight the waste sector and current-use products (used primarily indoors) as ongoing sources of PFAAs to the Canadian environment. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of integrating data from different media. Simultaneous evaluation of spatial and temporal trends in multiple media allows inferences that would be impossible with data on only one medium. As such, more co-ordination among monitoring sites for different media is suggested for future sampling, especially at the northern sites. We emphasize the importance of continued monitoring of multiple-media for determining future responses of environmental PFAA concentrations to voluntary and regulatory actions. © 2013.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2013.05.008,Perfluoroalkyl acids;Fish;effluent;wastewater;Canada;Wisconsin;United States;nonhuman;perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;bird;comparative study;Mammals;chemical compound;geographic distribution;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;pollution monitoring;concentration (composition);spatiotemporal analysis;urban area;urbanization;water pollution;wildlife;biota;article;environmental impact assessment;trend analysis;priority journal;food web;water contamination;perfluorononanoic acid;health hazard;Ontario [Canada];limit of detection;sediment;trend study;Lakes;perfluorododecanoate;alcohol;fluorotelomer alcohol;landfill;waste water treatment plant;environmental assessment;Sedimentation;concentration (parameters);dry weight;Potential sources;sediment pollution;water analysis;industrial area;oocyte;perfluorocarboxylate;air analysis;Data acquisition;environmental quality;Environmental quality;Federal environmental quality guidelines;guideline;indoor air pollution;landfill leachate;Larus argentarus;Leachate treatment;Multi-media analysis;perfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diester;perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate;perfluorophosphinate;perfluorophosphonate;perfluoroundecanoate;Salvelinus namaycush;sediment core;suspended sediment;Suspended sediments;Trends;trout;Trout Lake,NA,NA

As a result of aggregation and deposition, the concentration of TiO2 increased from upper to bottom layers in the water column. Concomitantly, due to adsorption of PFOS on the nano-TiO2 particles, PFOS also displayed an increasing trend from upper to bottom layer. Owing to ingestion of the TiO2-PFOS complexes, more PFOS was taken-up by fish. With the aid of intestinal fluid, PFOS was readily released from TiO2 particles and absorbed by fish. As a result, accumulation of PFOS in whole fish was facilitated and the bioaccumulation factors of PFOS in D. rerio, C. idella and H. plecostomus were 3.01, 2.42 and 1.11 times of that in the groups without TiO2. However, TiO2 aggregates were too large to penetrate biological membranes to participate body circulation, and no significant accumulation of TiO2 was observed in fish muscle.

In this study, the potential changes of PFAS concentrations as a result of boiling, frying and baking are systematically examined. Blue Swimmer Crab (Portunus armatus), Dusky Flathead (Platycephalus fuscus) and School Prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) were obtained from near a known PFAS point source and a reference location (affected by diffuse sources). Raw and cooked samples were analysed for commonly found PFASs. Of 23 target analytes, PFOS was the most frequently detected compound. PFOS, PFHxS and PFOA concentrations in School Prawn effectively doubled after boiling, and PFOS increased when Dusky Flathead was baked. There was no significant difference in PFOS concentration when Dusky Flathead was fried, or when the Blue Swimmer Crab was boiled. PFHxS and PFOA concentrations in Blue Swimmer Crab effectively halved after boiling. Increase in PFAS concentrations possibly arise from mass loss during the cooking process.

We were able to identify 469 putative PFOPA-binding proteins. By conducting competitive binding experiments using low (10 mu M) and high (100 mu M) concentrations of stable isotope-labeled PFOPA probes, we further identified 128 nonredundant peptides derived from 75 unique proteins that exhibit selective binding toward PFOPA. Additionally, we demonstrated that one of these proteins, fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5), could interact directly with PFASs, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohex-anesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). Furthermore, desthiobiotin-labeled lysine residues are located close to the fatty acid-binding pocket of FABP5, and the binding affinity varies with the structures of PFASs. Taken together, we developed a novel chemoproteomic method for interrogating the PFAS-interacting proteome. The identification of these proteins sets the stage for understanding the mechanisms through which exposure to PFASs confers adverse human health effects.",NA,10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01948,character(0),NA,NA

Here, we exposed Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) plants to a suite of 7 different PFAS, including 4 carboxylic acids (PFOA, PFHxA, PFHpA and PFDA) and 3 sulfonates (PFBS, PFHxS and PFOS). Exposed leaf tissues were subsequently fed to Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) caterpillars. Biomagnification factors (BMFs) were all below 1 and patterns of uptake and elimination were similar between the different PFAS. However, PFOS bioaccumulated in the hornworms to a much higher concentration, with approximately 5-fold higher BMFs and assimilation efficiencies (AEs) than other PFAS tested. AE and BMF, as well as PFAS uptake by the plants, were positively correlated with PFAS carbon chain length for both sulfonates and carboxylic acids, providing evidence that longer chain PFAS may be more efficiently accumulated (or less efficiently eliminated) than shorter-chain PFAS in some contexts.",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119814,character(0),NA,NA

Concentrations of PFASs were quantified as were reproductive success end points. The sample egg method was used wherein an egg sample is collected, and the hatching success of the remaining eggs in the nest is assessed. The association between PFAS exposure and reproductive success was assessed by site comparisons, logistic regression analysis, and multistate modeling, a technique not previously used in this context. There was a negative association between concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in eggs and hatching success. The concentration at which effects became evident (150-200 ng/g wet weight) was far lower than effect levels found in laboratory feeding trials or egg-injection studies of other avian species. This discrepancy was likely because behavioral effects and other extrinsic factors are not accounted for in these laboratory studies and the possibility that tree swallows are unusually sensitive to PFASs. The results from multistate modeling and simple logistic regression analyses were nearly identical. Multistate modeling provides a better method to examine possible effects of additional covariates and assessment of models using Akaike information criteria analyses. There was a credible association between PFOS concentrations in plasma and eggs, so extrapolation between these two commonly sampled tissues can be performed. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.",NA,10.1007/s00244-013-9934-0,Fluorocarbons;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Wisconsin;Minnesota;United States;environmental exposure;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;perfluoro compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);egg;pollution exposure;hatching;article;passerine;priority journal;pollution effect;organic pollutant;Aves;swallow (bird);Swallows;Tachycineta;Tachycineta bicolor;logistic regression analysis;geography;reproductive success;nesting;avifauna;Akaike information criterion;tree nester;Animal;Behavior;Deglutition;Trees,NA,NA

The large variation in the reported biological half-lives for PFOA and PFOS has remained unexplored. In this study, we aimed to evaluate their partition from serum to bile and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in humans. Four pairs of serum and bile, and 7 pairs of serum and CSF were donated by patients. In considering biliary excretion, the median concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in serum samples were 3.8 and 23.2 ng/mL, respectively, whereas those in bile samples were 1.0 and 27.9 ng/mL, respectively. The median ratio of PFOS concentrations (bile/serum: 0.60) was significantly higher than that for PFOA, 0.21 (p < 0.01). Biliary excretion rates for PFOA and PFOS in the present study subjects were estimated as 1.06 and 2.98 mL/kg/day, respectively, which is significantly higher than serum clearances via urine in humans and might represent a major excretion route. Biliary reabsorption rates of PFOA and PFOS were estimated to be 0.89 and 0.97, respectively. In considering partition into the cerebrospinal fluid, the median concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in serum samples were 2.6 and 18.4 ng/mL, respectively, whereas those in CSF samples were 0.06 and 0.10 ng/mL, respectively. The median ratio of PFOS concentrations (CSF/serum: 9.1 (×10-3)) was comparable to that of PFOA, 17.6 (×10-3), suggesting that PFOA and PFOS cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier freely. In conclusion, the biliary excretion of these compounds was comparable in both rats and humans and the long half-lives in humans might be attributable to low levels of excretion in urine and high biliary reabsorption rates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This recent body of work has led to a better understanding of the current levels and spatial and temporal trends of contaminants in biota, including the marine food species that northern peoples traditionally consume. Compared to other circumpolar countries, concentrations of many organochlorines (OCs) in Canadian Arctic marine biota are generally lower than in the European Arctic and eastern Greenland but are higher than in Alaska, whereas Hg concentrations are substantially higher in Canada than elsewhere. Spatial coverage of OCs in ringed seals, beluga and seabirds remains a strength of the Arctic contaminant data set for Canada. Concentrations of OCs in marine mammals and seabirds remain fairly consistent across the Canadian Arctic although subtle differences from west to east and south to north are found in the proportions of various chemicals. The most significant development since 1997 is improvement in the temporal trend data sets, thanks to the use of archived tissue samples from the 1970s and 1980s, long-term studies using archeological material, as well as the continuation of sampling. These data cover a range of species and chemicals and also include retrospective studies on new chemicals such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers. There is solid evidence in a few species (beluga, polar bear, blue mussels) that Hg at some locations has significantly increased from pre-industrial times to the present; however, the temporal trends of Hg over the past 20–30 years are inconsistent. Some animal populations exhibited significant increases in Hg whereas others did not. Therefore, it is currently not possible to determine if anthropogenic Hg is generally increasing in Canadian Arctic biota. It is also not yet possible to evaluate whether the recent Hg increases observed in some biota may be due solely to increased anthropogenic inputs or are in part the product of environmental change, e.g., climate warming. Concentrations of most “legacy” OCs (PCBs, DDT, etc.) significantly declined in Canadian Arctic biota from the 1970s to the late 1990s, and today are generally less than half the levels of the 1970s, particularly in seabirds and ringed seals. Chlorobenzenes and endosulfan were among the few OCs to show increases during this period while ∑HCH remained relatively constant in most species. A suite of new-use chemicals previously unreported in Arctic biota (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), perfluoro-octane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs)) has recently been found, but there is insufficient information to assess species differences, spatial patterns or food web dynamics for these compounds. Concentrations of these new chemicals are generally lower than legacy OCs, but there is concern because some are rapidly increasing in concentration (e.g., PBDEs), while others such as PFOS have unique toxicological properties, and some were not expected to be found in the Arctic because of their supposedly low potential for long-range transport. Continuing temporal monitoring of POPs and Hg in a variety of marine biota must be a priority.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.10.034,Military Personnel;United States;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Marine mammals;Waste products,NA,NA

This review summarizes the current knowledge on PAPs and highlights the knowledge gaps. PAPs dominated the PFAS profiles in wastewater, sludge, household dust, food-contact materials, paper products, paints, and cosmetics. They exhibit biomagnification due to their higher levels in top predators.

Toxicokinetic studies suggest that after entering the body, most PAPs undergo biotransformation, generating phase Ⅰ (i.e., PFCAs), phase II, and intermediate products with toxicity to be verified. Several epidemiological and toxicological studies have reported the antiandrogenic effect, estrogenic effect, thyroid disruption, oxidative damage, and reproductive toxicity of PAPs.

One to four orders of magnitude higher concentrations of OBS than other polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in all samples indicate that industrial emission is an important point source of OBS in the surrounding environment. The concentrations of OBS in surface water, sediment, and soil decreased exponentially as the distance from the FMF increases.

Mono-hydroxylated transformation products of OBS were first identified in water, sediment, and fish, suggesting its hydroxylation may exist in the real environment. The transformation of OBS may explain its significantly lower bioaccumulation than PFOS in fish.

In reporter gene assays the chemicals exhibited agonistic activity toward TRs, with the potency of 6:2 Cl-PFAES comparable to that of PFOS. The chemicals also promoted GH3 cell proliferation, with 6:2 Cl-PFAES displaying the highest potency. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation revealed that both Cl-PFAESs fit into the ligand binding pockets of TTR and TRs with the binding modes similar to PFOS. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Cl-PFAESs might cause TH disruption effects through competitive binding to transport proteins and activation of TRs. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.8b01494,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Thyroid Hormones;Receptors;Cell proliferation;fluorocarbon;Hormones;thyroid hormone;unclassified drug;controlled study;pollutant;binding affinity;Binding energy;molecular docking;Molecular Docking Simulation;molecular interaction;protein;Chlorine compounds;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;chlorination;alkanesulfonic acid;sulfonate;human;ecotoxicology;bioassay;Environmental contaminant;hormone;molecular dynamics;protein binding;human cell;IC50;Proteins;thyroid hormone receptor;cell proliferation;Chemical activation;Chemicals;cell nucleus receptor;prealbumin;chemical binding;ligand binding;crystal structure;Transport proteins;Molecular dynamics;GH3 cell line;critical micelle concentration;Nuclear receptors;Agonistic activity;Competitive binding;competitive binding assay;Fluorescence binding;hormone binding;hormone binding protein;polyfluoroalkylether sulfonate derivative;reporter gene;Reporter gene assays;Thyroid Hormone;Nuclear Proteins;Sulfones;Thyroid Gland,NA,NA

Since the initial studies in 2001 their presence, distribution, and fate in the environment has broadly been studied. PFOS, perfluorooctane sulfonate, is the dominant and most frequently detected PFAA in wildlife from around the world. Additionally long-chain (greater than eight carbons long) perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) have also been measured in biota, with some of the highest concentrations being measured in wildlife from the Arctic. The majority of temporal studies have shown PFOS concentrations increasing over time; however, more recent observations have started showing a decline in PFOS in some wildlife. Long-chain PFCA (greater than eight carbons) concentrations have shown an increase in recent temporal studies, with PFCA concentrations comparable to those of PFOS measured in the same animals. Many food-web studies have examined bioaccumulation and biomagnification of PFAAs. Most studies have shown biomagnification of PFAAs, with PFOS especially having a higher biomagnification potential compared to the PFCAs. While much work has been done during the 15 years PFAAs have been examined in wildlife, there are still gaps. There has been limited work on wildlife from terrestrial ecosystems. There are also many geographical locations that have very limited studies or lack them altogether. Additional monitoring of the terrestrial environment and the inclusion of new geographical locations are needed to help understand the global distribution of PFAAs in wildlife. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",NA,10.1007/978-3-319-15518-0_5,Biomonitoring;Fish;Temporal trends;Mammals;Food-web,NA,NA

While there is a growing body of literature describing PFAS in seabird species, knowledge from temperate Southern Hemisphere regions is lacking. Little penguins (Eudyptula minor) can nest and forage within heavily urbanised coastal environments and hence may be at risk of exposure to pollutants. We analysed scat contaminated nesting soils (n = 50) from 17 colonies in lutruwita/Tasmania for 16 PFAS, plasma samples (n = 45) from nine colonies, and three eggs for 49 PFAS. We detected 14 PFAS across the sample types, with perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) most commonly detected. Mean concentration of PFOS in plasma was 2.56 ± 4.3 ng/mL (<LOD–22.3), soil was 2.92 ± 5.39 μg/kg (<LOD–29.8) and eggs were 11.89 ± 11.30 μg/kg (0.27–22.84). Mean concentration of PFHxS in plasma was 0.9 ± 0.84 ng/mL (<LOD–5.6), soil was 11.4 ± 39.18 μg/kg (<LOD–213.3) and eggs were 0.27 ± 0.11 μg/kg (<LOD–0.38). Urbanisation of breeding sites was positively associated with PFOS and PFHxS concentrations in soils and blood. Phenology appeared to be an important predictor of PFHxS load, with moulting birds having lower levels compared to non-moulting birds. We investigated PFAS associations with health parameters and found that haematocrit and total plasma proteins in females were negatively associated with PFOS and positively associated in males. The number of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities in males was positively associated with PFOS. Findings are the first to document the presence of PFAS in this resident seabird nesting and foraging close to anthropogenically modified habitats. We demonstrate that even in low concentrations, PFAS may have detectable relationships with penguin health.

Computational studies appear to be a relevant approach to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms triggered by POPs. We investigated the use of a systems toxicology approach to explore the effects of POPs on human health. A protein-protein association network (PPAN) was developed based on known POP-protein interactions. This model was used to predict protein complexes for several candidate POPs, including dicofol, methoxychlor, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), that are listed or proposed to be listed as POPs by the Stockholm Convention. Integration of multiple data sources (pathways, disease annotations, adverse outcome pathways) involving the identified protein complexes was performed independently in order to reveal putative risk factors for human health. This approach revealed that several systems may be disturbed by these candidate POPs, mainly the reproductive, metabolic and nervous systems. This study highlights that a computational systems toxicology approach may help to decipher putative biological mechanisms of poorly studied chemicals and link them to possible adverse effects with the aim to support regulatory assessment and trigger new epidemiological and experimental studies. In order to develop more accurate computational models as alternative methods to animal testing, the next challenge will be to integrate more data according to the findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data principles. © The Authors, 2020.",NA,10.14573/altex.1910161,Humans;Animals;Article;Risk Factors;animal;nonhuman;persistent organic pollutant;Persistent Organic Pollutants;perfluorooctanoic acid;prediction;procedures;toxicity;human;toxicology;linoleic acid;endocrine disruptor;toxicity testing;prolactin;risk factor;biological activity;cytotoxicity;tumor necrosis factor;physical chemistry;bioinformatics;phenotype;cytochrome P450 1A1;estrogen receptor;estrogen receptor alpha;protein protein interaction;Toxicity Tests;glucocorticoid receptor;scoring system;dimpylate;adverse outcome pathway;endosulfan;methoxychlor;cell stress;workflow;systems biology;gelatinase B;gene ontology;biological phenomena;functions concerning the entire organism;acaricide;animal testing alternative;Animal Testing Alternatives;biology;Computational Biology;cytochrome P450 2B6;cytochrome P450 2C19;cytochrome P450 2C9;cytochrome P450 3A4;dicofol;eprinomectin;proteins by cellular component;Systems Biology;Computer Systems;Animal Shells,NA,NA

However, most of the studies are concentrated in surface water with high concentration of PFCs in rivers, sewage and lakes, while few studies explore the status of PFCs pollution in groundwater. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the content, distribution and ecological risk of typical PFCs compounds in groundwater in the reclaimed water irrigation area of Beijing. METHODS:52 groundwater samples were collected from the reclaimed water irrigation area in May to June 2020 and were analyzed by solid phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). RESULTS: The results showed that 10 target PFCs including perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSAs) were detected in groundwater in Beijing, with a concentration of 1.07-24.19ng/L. Among them, the highest detected concentration of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) averaged 2.94ng/L, 2.88ng/L and 1.15ng/L, respectively. The concentration of ∑PFCs in this study was relatively low compared to the groundwater from the fluorochemical industrial park, which was related to the mostly farmland location of the observation wells in the study area. After observing the performance of PFCs in shallow wells (< 50m) and deep wells (>50m), it was found that the concentration of PFCs decreased significantly with increasing well depth. In addition, in view of the spatial distribution of groundwater PFCs in the whole region, the concentration of groundwater PFCs around the landfill was significantly high and decreased with increasing distance from the landfill, indicating that the landfill had a certain contribution to the pollution of surrounding groundwater PFCs. CONCLUSIONS: By calculating the risk quotient of PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and PFBA, the landfill has not posed an ecological risk to the surrounding environment. However, in view of the concealment and persistence of groundwater PFCs, it is recommended to carry out continuous regular monitoring and evaluation. © 2023 Yankuang Ceshi.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant PFAS in all eggs with mean concentrations up to 42 ng/g wet weight (ww) in samples from 2003. Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDcS) were found at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower than PFOS. The general accumulation profile of perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) in herring gull eggs was characterized by high proportions of odd and long carbon (C) chain length compounds in which perfluoroundecanoate (C 11) and perfluorotridecanoate (C13) dominated with mean concentrations up to 4.2 and 2.8 ng/g ww, respectively. In both colonies PFOS concentrations in eggs showed a nearly 2-fold significant increase from 1983 to 1993, followed by a leveling off up to 2003. A comparable trend was found for PFHxS, whereas PFDcS was found to increase also between 1993 and 2003. PFCA concentrations showed marked significant increases during 1983-1993 associated with either a weak rise post-1993 (C8- to C11-PFCAs), although nonsignificant, or leveling off (C12- and C 13-PFCAS). However, the composition of individual PFCAs (C 8 to C15) to the summed concentrations of those eight PFCAs highly differed between the colonies and sampling years investigated.

The PFAAs studied were perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs, C6-C15 chain lengths) and sulfonates (C4, C6, C8, and C10 chain lengths) as well as selected precursors including perfluorooctane sulfonamide. On a wet-weight basis, blood-brain barrier transport of PFAAs occurred for all brain regions, although inner regions of the brain closer to incoming blood flow (pons/medulla, thalamus, and hypothalamus) contained consistently higher PFAA concentrations compared to outer brain regions (cerebellum, striatum, and frontal, occipital, and temporal cortices). For pons/medulla, thalamus, and hypothalamus, the most concentrated PFAAs were perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), ranging from 47 to 58ng/g wet weight, and perfluorotridecanoic acid, ranging from 43 to 49ng/g wet weight. However, PFOS and the longer-chain PFCAs (C10-C15) were significantly (p<0.002) positively correlated with lipid content for all brain regions. Lipid-normalized PFOS and PFCA (C10-C15) concentrations were not significantly (p>0.05) different among brain regions. The burden of the sum of PFCAs, perfluoroalkyl sulfonates, and perfluorooctane sulfonamide in the brain (average mass, 392g) was estimated to be 46μg. The present study demonstrates that both PFCAs and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates cross the blood-brain barrier in polar bears and that wet-weight concentrations are brain region-specific. Environ.

Eight of the peptides (beta C1, beta C3, beta C5, beta C6, beta C8, beta C11, beta C12, and beta C14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with beta C8, beta C12, and beta C14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine beta-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of beta C1, beta C3, beta C5, beta C6, beta C8, beta C11, beta C12, and beta C14 were corresponded to the f(100-105), f(108-113), f(177-183), f(170-176), f(98-105), f(106-113), f(100-107), and f(170-183) regions of bovine beta-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not.

Nine quaternary amine tags with mass differences as low as 0.0058 Da had no observable chromatographic shifts, small amounts of ion suppression, and minimal matrix effects. Low concentration perfluoropentanoic acid was used as an ion pairing reagent to improve the retention of derivatized aldehydes. Perfluoropentanoic acid addition showed an average of three-fold improvement in limits of detection, 50% reduction in peak width, and 2.5 fold increase in analyte retention. Analysis of fifteen tagged aldehydes yielded an average of 13 nM limit of detection, 9 %RSD, R-2 of 0.995, and linear dynamic range of 40-1000 nM. In a single 20 min separation, absolute quantitative data was obtained for 11 reactive aldehydes across 8 aortic endothelial cell samples. High glucose treatment produced significant changes to malondialdehyde, decanal, and (2E)-hexadecenal. These changes are consistent with glucoseinduced oxidative stress.

However, the indirect contribution from precursors has not been well characterized. In this study, 24 PFASs were measured in the paired human blood and urine from general volunteers (n = 20), as well as their corresponding exposure matrices (7 day duplicate diet, drinking water and dust). Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was predominant, followed by 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA), contributing 21.6-47.0 and 6.6-20.0% of the total concentrations, respectively. Total oxidable precursor (TOP) assay and isomeric analysis coupled with a toxicokinetic model suggested that around 19% of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in human was contributed by its precursors. The strong correlation between the estimated daily intake (EDI) and human blood concentration for 6:2 Cl-PFESA suggested that it was mainly contributed by direct exposure. The bioavailability of 6:2 Cl-PFESA in the food matrices was estimated as 18.6% by comparing the estimated and measured blood concentrations, implying that human exposure might be overestimated if the bioavailability of PFASs in food was not considered.

Large-scale, long-term monitoring of urban lakes requires careful prioritization of available resources, focusing efforts on potentially impaired lakes. Herein, a database of PFOS concentrations in 304 fish caught from 28 urban lakes was used for development of an urban-lake prioritization framework by means of exploratory data analysis (EDA) with the aid of a geographical information system. The prioritization scheme consists of three main tiers: preliminary classification, carried out by hierarchical cluster analysis; predictor screening, fulfilled by a regression tree method; and model development by means of a neural network. The predictive performance of the newly developed model was assessed using a training/validation splitting method and determined by an external validation set. The application of the model in the U.S. state of Minnesota identified 40 urban lakes that may contain elevated levels of PFOS; these lakes were not previously considered in PFOS monitoring programs. The model results also highlight ongoing industrial/commercial activities as a principal determinant of PFOS pollution in urban lakes, and suggest vehicular traffic as an important source and surface runoff as a primary pollution carrier. In addition, the EDA approach was further compared to a spatial interpolation method (kriging), and their advantages and disadvantages were discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.watres.2013.09.063,Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;PFASs;Persistent organic pollutants;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Minnesota;United States;nonhuman;Organic pollutants;environmental monitoring;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;surfactant;urban area;urbanization;article;Urbanization;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;priority journal;water contamination;pollution effect;lake;Lakes;Lake pollution;Reproducibility of Results;Fishes;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);validation process;numerical model;Cluster Analysis;Cities;Water Pollutants;Conservation of Natural Resources;screening test;lake pollution;water quality;Water quality;Chemical;Models;runoff;data base;Theoretical;water management;Classification;cluster analysis;Cluster analysis;geographic information system;Hierarchical cluster analysis;Hierarchical systems;traffic;Water management;AADT;Annual average daily traffic volume;Application programs;CRT;Distance-normalized traffic volume;DNTF;EDA;Exploratory data analysis;Geographic information systems;Geographic Information Systems;GIS;Industrial contaminants;Interpolation;kriging;Neural network;NN;prioritization;regression tree;resource availability;Spatial Analysis;Spatial interpolation method;TCW;Twin Cities Watershed;Urban water management;Watershed-to-lake area ratio;WLA;Sulfones,NA,NA

Since comprehensive multimedia exposure model has not been developed for PFCs, assessment of the potential risk due to exposure to PFCs through direct water consumption could be a conservative estimate. The human health risks derived from the exposure to PFCs through water consumption were assessed for different age groups of general population in Taiwan using probabilistic approach. Based on available data on concentrations of PFCs in river water, exposure to PFOS, PFOA and PFDA via water consumption for different age groups were calculated using deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment methods. The oral non-cancer risks from PFOS, PFOA and their combination, expressed as a Hazard Index (HI), was determined by comparing oral exposure dose (through water intake) with the oral Reference Dose (RfD). The average exposure to PFOS, PFOA and PFDA via water consumption for adults ranged from 0.16 to 220.15, 0.43 to 12.5 and 0.43 to 2.36ngkg-bw<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> and for children 0.13–354.3, 0.35–20.17 and 0.35–3.79ngkg-bw<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.

When the concentration exceeds the acceptable limit, it has negative consequences for humans. In such a case, PFAS monitoring is critical, and a quick detection technique are highly needed. Health departments and regulatory agencies have interests in monitoring of PFAS presences and exposures. For the detection of PFAS, numerous highly precise and sensitive chromatographic methods are available. However, the drawbacks of analytical techniques include timely sample preparations and the lack of on-site applicability. As a result, there is an increasing demand for simple sensor systems for monitoring of PFAS in real field samples. In this review, we first describe the sample pre-treatment and analytical techniques for the detection of PFAS.

Methods: A total of 892 E. coli isolates collected from individual pigs (n=368), chickens (n=196), ducks (n=261), geese (n=35), pigeons (n=20) and partridges (n=12) in Guangdong Province during 2002-08 were screened for the presence of fosA3, fosA and fosC2 by PCR amplification and sequencing. The clonal relationship of fosA3-positive isolates, plasmid content and other associated resistance genes were also characterized. Results: Twelve (1.3%) E. coli isolates showed resistance to fosfomycin and 10 (1.1%) isolates (4 from pigs, 2 from chickens, 2 from ducks, 1 from a goose and 1 from a pigeon) were positive for fosA3. None of the E. coli isolates was positive for fosA or fosC2. All of the isolates carrying fosA3 were CTX-M producers, and three of them carried rmtB. Most of the fosA3-harbouring isolates were found to be clonally unrelated. The fosA3 genes were flanked by IS26. Two fosA3 genes co-localized with rmtB and bla(CTX-M-65) on indistinguishable F33:A-:B- plasmids that carried three addiction systems (pemI/pemK, hok/mok/sok and srnB). Four, one and one fosA3 genes were found to be associated with IncN (ST8 type), Inch 1 and F2:A-:B- plasmids, respectively. Conclusions: We discovered that fosA3 is always associated with blo(CTX-M), which facilitates its quick dispersal.

Lack of uniformity in calibrant selection for estimating suspect concentrations among different laboratories makes comparing reported suspect concentrations difficult. In this study, a practical approach whereby the area counts for 50 anionic and 5 zwitterionic/cationic target PFAS were ratioed to the average area of their respective stable-isotope labeled surrogates to create ""average PFAS calibration curves"" for suspects detected in negative-and positive-ionization mode liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The calibration curves were fitted with log-log and weighted linear regression models. The two models were evaluated for their accuracy and prediction interval in predicting the target PFAS concentrations. The average PFAS calibration curves were then used to estimate the suspect PFAS concentration in a well-characterized aqueous film-forming foam. Weighted linear regression resulted in more target PFAS that fell within 70-130% of their known standard value and narrower prediction intervals than the log-log transformation approach. The summed suspect PFAS concentrations calculated by weighted linear regression and log-log transformation were within 8 and 16% of those estimated by a 1:1 matching strategy.

We examined effects of chronic low-level exposure to atrazine, tributyltin, bisphenol A, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and perfluorooctanoic acid on rhesus monkey TSCs in vitro by RNA sequencing. Pathway analysis of affected genes revealed negative effects on cytokine signaling related to anti-viral response, most strongly for atrazine and tributyltin, but shared with the other three EDCs. Other affected processes included metabolism, DNA repair, and cell migration. Low-level chronic exposure of primate TSCs to EDCs may thus compromise trophoblast development in vivo, inhibit responses to infection, and negatively affect embryo implantation and pregnancy.

We find that PBDEs remain at high levels in indoor dust, including in homes, schools, and cars, especially in cars showing a significant upward trend. There is a trend towards an increase in the proportion of BDE-209 in household dust, which is indicative of recent PBDE contamination. Conversely, PBDE congeners in car and school indoor dust tended to shift from highly brominated to low brominated, suggesting a shift in current pollution patterns. Indoor dust exposure causes significantly higher PBDE burdens in children, especially infants in early life, than in adults.

In 73% of the analyzed samples, at least some of the target PFCs were detected at concentrations higher than the limit of detection (LOD). The sum of the 21 target analytes (∑21PFCs) ranged from 4.3 to 68.5 ng L−1, with the highest concentrations measured in the month of June, probably due to a minor river streamflow occurring in the warmer summer months.

They occupy the highest trophic positions in their food chains and are documented to bioaccumulate high concentrations of persistent pollutants such as toxic metals and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs).Whereas raptors played a critical role in developing awareness of and policy for chemical pollution, they have thus far played a much smaller role in current research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Given the critical knowledge obtained from monitoring 'legacy contaminants' in raptors, more information on the levels and effects of CECs on raptors is urgently needed. This study critically reviews studies on raptors from Europe reporting the occurrence of CECs with focus on the investigated species, the sampled matrices, and the bioanalytical methods applied. Based on this, we aimed to identify future needs for monitoring CECs in Europe. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs), and to a lesser extent UV-filters, neonicotinoids, chlorinated paraffins, parabens and bisphenols have been reported in European raptors. White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) were the most frequently studied raptor species. Among matrices, eggs, feathers and plasma were the most widely employed, although the potential role of the preen gland as an excretory organ for CECs has recently been proposed. This review highlights the following research priorities for pollution research on raptors in Europe: 1) studies covering all the main classes of CECs; 2) research in other European regions (mainly East Europe); 3) identification of the most suitable matrices and species for the analysis of different CECs; and 4) the application of alternative sample treatment strategies (e.g. QuEChERS or pressurized liquid extraction) is still limited and conventional solvent-extraction is the preferred choice.

Furthermore, H19 appeared to partially improve the cell growth of HTR-8/SVneo cells exposed to PFOS via upregulation of miR-19a and miR-19b. In summary, our findings revealed that H1 9/miR-19a and miR-19b/SMAD4 axis exerted important functions in PFOS-induced placenta cell toxicity. Image 1 • PFOS exposure suppresses cell growth in human HTR-8/SVneo cells. • PFOS enhances expression of H19 in placenta of mice and HTR-8/SVneo cells. • PFOS reduced miR-19a and miR-19b expression in placenta of mice and HTR-8/SVneo cells. • Suppression of H19 partially attenuates PFOS-induced cell growth inhibition in HTR8/SVneo cells. • Upregulation of miR-19a and miR-19b partially attenuates PFOS-induced cell growth inhibition in HTR8/SVneo cells. • H19 regulates SMAD4 expression by competitively sponging miR-19a and miR-19b exposed to PFOS.",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127640,Cell growth;Birth weight;Preeclampsia;Pollutants;Persistent pollutants;Trophoblast;Pregnancy complications,NA,NA

Concentrations of the total PFASs (ΣPFASs) in limnetic sediments ranged from 0.719 to 2.429 ng/g dry weight (dw), with an average of 1.449 ng/g dw. A clear gradient in the spatial distribution was observed from west to east in surface sediments of Lake Chaohu. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid were predominant in limnetic sediments, with an average of 0.383 and 0.275 ng/g dw, respectively. The ΣPFASs concentrations in riverine sediments were the highest in the Shiwuli River, followed by the Nanfei River. PFASs in riverine sediments indicated that industrial discharge and urban runoff played key roles in PFAS distribution and pollution levels. In vertical profiles, concentrations of the ΣPFASs and PFAS congeners in three sediment cores generally increased with decreasing depths, indicating that the input history of the ΣPFASs could be attributed to the development of industrialization and urbanization in the Chaohu Lake basin. The correlations between PFASs and sedimentary characteristics, organic carbon, nutrients and inorganic salts suggested that both hydrophobic and electrostatic effects played important roles in PFAS distribution and pollution levels in sediments of Lake Chaohu. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We used solar geolocation loggers and stable isotope analysis to study the effects of post breeding dispersal and diet on persistent organic pollutant (POP) and mercury (Hg) burdens in rhinoceros auklets, Cerorhinca monocerata, breeding on islands along the Pacific Coast of Canada. Hg and four classes of POPs were measured in auklet eggs: organochlorine insecticides (OCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and perfluoralkyl substances (PFASs). Stable isotope values of adult breast feathers grown during winter were used in conjunction with geolocation to elucidate adult wintering latitude. Wintering latitude was the most consistent and significant predictor of some POP and of Hg concentrations in eggs. The magnitude and pattern of exposure varied by contaminant, with PPCBs, PPBDEs and DDE decreasing with wintering latitude, and mirex, perfluoro-n-tridecanoic acid, and Hg increasing with latitude. We suggest that concentrations of these contaminants in rhinoceros auklet eggs are influenced by variation in uptake at adult wintering locations related to anthropogenic inputs and oceanic and atmospheric transport.

However, concerns over emerging trace contaminants that persist through wastewater treatment need to be addressed to evaluate potential risks. In the present study, perfluorinated surfactant residues were characterized in recycled water from four California wastewater treatment plants that employ tertiary treatment and one that treats primary sewage in a wetland constructed for both treatment and wildlife habitat. Effluent concentrations were compared with surface and groundwater from a creek where recycled water was evaluated as a potential means to augment flow (Upper Silver and Coyote Creeks, San Jose, CA). In the recycled water, 90-470 ng/l perfluorochemicals were detected, predominantly perfluorooctanoate (PFOA; 10-190 ng/l) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; 20-190 ng/l). No significant removal of perfluorochemicals was observed in the wetland (total concentration ranged 100-170 ng/l across various treatment stages); in this case, 2-(N-ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamido) acetic acid (N-EtFOSAA), perfluorodecanesulfonate (PFDS), and PFOS were dominant. Though there is currently no wastewater discharge into the creeks, perfluorochemicals were found in the surface water and underlying groundwater at a total of 20-150 ng/l with PFOS and PFOA again making the largest contribution.

In this study, we analysed the level of PFAS contamination in the fish fauna of the Po River, the most important waterway in Italy, to evaluate the influence of different factors (such as fish ecological traits and parasitism) on the accumulation of 17 PFAS. After solvent extraction and purification, hepatic or intestinal tissues from forty specimens of bleak, channel catfish, and barbel were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LOQ = 2.5 ng/g w.w.). The prevalent PFAS were perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), present in all samples at the highest concentration (reaching a maximum of 126.4 ng/g and 114.4 ng/g in bleak and channel catfish, respectively), and long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFDA and PFUnDA). Perfluorooctanoic acid and new generation PFAS (Gen X and C6O4) were not detected. Comparison of the hepatic contamination between the benthic channel catfish and the pelagic bleak showed similar concentrations of PFOS (p > 0.05) but significantly higher concentrations of other individual PFAS and of the sum of all measured PFAS (p < 0.05) in bleak. No correlation was found between the hepatic level of PFAS and fish size in channel catfish.For the first time, PFAS partitioning in a parasite-fish system was studied: intestinal acanthocephalans accumulated PFOS at lower levels than the intestinal tissue of their host (barbel), in contrast to what has been reported for other pollutants (e.g., metals).

Contamination studies involving non-destructive sampling methods are of considerable importance, allowing better evaluation of the levels of pollutants and their toxic effects. In the present study, organohalogen contaminants were analyzed in 113 blood samples from Southern Giant Petrel (Macronectes giganteus) adults and chicks collected in the austral summer of 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 from colonies on Elephant and Livingston Islands, South Shetland, Antarctica. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), pentachlorobenzene (PeCB), mirex, dichlorodiphenyltri-chloroetane and derivatives (DDTs) and chlordanes were detected in all birds, whereas polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were not detected in any blood samples. No significant differences were found in organochlorine levels between sampling events. Adults exhibited significantly higher levels than chicks, except for PeCB. PCBs, HCB, mirex and DDTs were statistically similar in males and females from Elephant Island. Females on Livingston Island exhibited higher HCB values than males, but no sex differences were found regarding other organochlorines. The similarity in organochlorine levels between sexes in birds with very marked sexual segregation in feeding habits during the breeding season may indicate that significant amounts of contaminants are acquired during migration to lower latitudes, when the diets of males and females are similar. Birds sampled on Livingston Island exhibited significantly lower levels of PCBs, HCB, DDTs, mirex and chlordanes in comparison to those on Elephant Island, which could be the result of distinct foraging patterns between the two colonies. Organochlorine levels were similar between years in birds captured in two consecutive breeding seasons. Blood samples from Southern Giant Petrels adults and chicks proved to be useful for the comparison of intraspecific contamination levels and appear to be adequate for the long-term assessment of organohalogen contaminants in antarctic top predators. Organochlorine contaminants in blood samples of Southern Giant Petrels reflected intra-specific differences and suggested distinct foraging patterns between colonies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the regulatory alteration of select metabolites with PFOS exposure at early and typical acute exposure periods in an aquatic indicator species Daphnia magna, the hourly abundance of the twenty-three metabolites was investigated over 24 h. To evaluate the bioaccumulation potential of PFOS at a sub-lethal concentration in D. magna, the daily accumulation into D. magna for 16 days was also evaluated. Twenty-three targeted metabolites were quantified over 1 to 4 h and 21 to 24 h of PFOS exposure using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Daphnid to water PFOS concentration ratios were monitored separately over different days and life stages at 0 to 76 h and 2 to 16 days of PFOS exposure. The observed metabolite abundance and bioaccumulation in the exposed groups was compared between sampling times. The results reveal that sub-lethal PFOS exposure at 2 mg/L and 20 mg/L alters regulation of arginine, tyrosine and adenosine monophosphate which are directly and indirectly related to energy status. The temporal metabolic responses observed for the early exposure period (4 h), but not for the typical acute exposure period (24 h), suggest the dysregulation potency of PFOS on metabolite regulation of D. magna and the importance of early time-course monitoring approaches. Sixteen days of bioaccumulation monitoring showed that PFOS is more bioaccumulative in younger D. magna. The observation of time-dependent bioaccumulation of PFOS in D. magna requires further studies to define its precise mechanism. Interestingly, the bioaccumulation potential of PFOS was found to be consistent between 72 h and 16 day exposure periods. No difference on the body burden to water concentration ratio during about one third of the life span time (16 days), compared to the 72 h exposure, suggests that the prolonged exposure did not increase the bioaccumulation of PFOS in D. magna. This study demonstrates that the Daphnia metabolites are rapidly responding to sub-lethal PFOS exposure and provides information on life stage and time-dependent bioaccumulation potential of PFOS. As such, metabolite regulation is a sensitive indicator to sub-lethal PFOS exposure and can be informative when combined with other measures of toxicity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.cbd.2020.100701,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Bioaccumulation;Chromatography;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;controlled study;bioaccumulation;pollutant;concentration ratio;water pollutant;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;principal component analysis;alkanesulfonic acid;high performance liquid chromatography;liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;mass spectrometry;growth;metabolism;limit of quantitation;isoleucine;phenylalanine;valine;toxicity testing;multiple reaction monitoring;protein degradation;metabolite;body burden;electrospray;nitric oxide;aquatic species;metabolomics;aging;Daphnia;Daphnia magna;Water Pollutants;arginine;glutamine;long term exposure;proline;tyrosine;adenosine phosphate;development;Chemical;citric acid cycle;particulate matter;Liquid;aspartic acid;short term exposure;energy yield;metabolic fingerprinting;Metabolic profiling;Aquatic toxicity;biomolecular response;molecular mechanics;Zooplankton;Sulfones,NA,NA

Once discharged from industrial, domestic and urban sources into the urban wastewater collection system they may transfer to the residual solids during wastewater treatment and assessment of their significance and implications for beneficial recycling of the treated sewage sludge biosolids is required. Research on organic contaminants (OCs) in biosolids has been undertaken for over thirty years and the increasing body of evidence demonstrates that the majority of compounds studied do not place human health at risk when biosolids are recycled to farmland. However, there are 143,000 chemicals registered in the European Union for industrial use and all could be potentially found in biosolids. Therefore, a literature review of ‘emerging’ OCs in biosolids has been conducted for a selection of chemicals of potential concern for land application based upon human toxicity, evidence of adverse effects on the environment and endocrine disruption. To identify monitoring and research priorities the selected chemicals were ranked using an assessment matrix approach. Compounds were evaluated based upon environmental persistence, human toxicity, evidence of bioaccumulation in humans and the environment, evidence of ecotoxicity and the number and quality of studies focussed on the contaminant internationally. The identified chemicals of concern were ranked in decreasing order of priority: perfluorinated chemicals (PFOS, PFOA); polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs); organotins (OTs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC); benzothiazoles; antibiotics and pharmaceuticals; synthetic musks; bisphenol A, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), steroids; phthalate acid esters (PAEs) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMSs). A number of issues were identified and recommendations for the prioritisation of further research and monitoring of ”emerging” OCs for the agricultural use of biosolids are provided. In particular, a number of ‘emerging’ OCs (PFOS, PFOA and PCAs) were identified for priority attention that are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic with unique chemical properties, or are present in large concentrations in sludge, that make it theoretically possible for them to enter human and ecological food-chains from biosolids-amended soil.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2010.06.004,Health risk assessment;Wastewater treatment;Gas chromatography;the environment;World Health Organization;Industrial contamination;Chlorinated paraffin;Polybrominated biphenyls;Sewage sludge &amp,NA,NA

Despite expectations of low accumulation, short-chain PFECAs, such as perfluoro-2-methoxyacetic acid (PFMOAA), previously displayed a considerably high body burden, although the main exposure routes and health risks remain uncertain. Here, we explored the distribution of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in diverse environmental media surrounding a FIP in Shandong Province, China. PFECAs were found at elevated concentrations in all tested matrices, including vegetables, cereals, air, and dust. Among residents, 99.3% of the ∑36PFAS exposure, with a 43.9% contribution from PFECAs, was due to gastrointestinal uptake. Dermal and respiratory exposures were negligible at 0.1 and 0.6%, respectively. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of PFMOAA reached 114.0 ng/kg body weight (bw)/day, ranking first among all detected PFECAs.

Recent studies have shown that Cl-PFESAs could interfere with thyroid function in animal models. However, epidemiological evidence on the link between Cl-PFESAs and thyroid function remains scarce. In this study, we focused on two representative legacy perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), including PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and two PFOS alternatives (6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFESAs) in the general adult population from a cross-sectional study, the ""Isomers of C8 Health Project in China"". Three serum thyroid hormones (THs), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4), were measured. We fitted generalized linear regression, restricted cubic spline regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression models to assess associations of individual Cl-PFESAs, legacy PFAS, and PFAS mixtures with THs, respectively. We found individual PFAS and their mixtures were nonlinearly associated with THs. The estimated changes of the TSH level (μIU/mL) at the 95th percentile of 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS against the 5th percentile were -0.74 (95% CI: -0.94, -0.54) and -1.18 (95% CI: -1.37, -0.98), respectively.

Laboratory experiments have revealed toxic effects such as delayed development, humoral suppression, and hepatotoxicity. Although numerous human blood levels have been reported, little is known about distribution in the human body. Knowledge about PFC distribution and accumulation in the human body is crucial to understanding uptake and subsequent effects as well as to conduct risk assessments. The present study reports PFC levels in human liver and breast milk from a general population living in Catalonia, Spain. Liver and milk levels are compared to previously reported levels in blood from the same geographic area as well as to other existing reports on human liver and milk levels in other countries. Materials and methods: Human liver (n = 12) and milk (n = 10) samples were collected in 2007 and 2008 in Catalonia, Spain. Liver samples were taken postmortem from six males and six females aged 27-79 years. Milk samples were from healthy primipara women (30-39 years old). Both liver and milk were analyzed by solid-phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Six PFCs were detected in liver, with perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS, 26.6 ng/g wet weight) being the chemical with the highest mean concentration. Other PFCs such as perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and acids with chain lengths up to C11 were also detected, with mean levels ranging between 0.50 and 1.45 ng/g wet weight. On the other hand, PFOS and PFHxS were the only PFCs detected in human milk, with mean concentrations of 0.12 and 0.04 ng/mL, respectively. Discussion: While milk concentrations were similar to reported levels from other countries, liver samples contained more PFCs above quantification limits and higher PFOS concentrations compared to the only two other reports found in the literature. Differences between the results of the present study and those concerning previous investigations can be due to declining levels of some PFCs, which have been reported for the USA. The relationship between PFC concentrations in human liver, milk, and blood was assessed using blood concentrations previously determined in Catalonia. Those levels resulted in liver/serum ratios of 1.7:1, 1.4:1, and 2.1:1 for PFOS, perfluorodecanoic acid, and perfluoroundecanoic acid, respectively. Accumulation in liver is suggested for PFOS and the perfluorocarboxylic acids with carbon chain lengths C9, C10, and C11. For PFOA and PFHxS, fivefold and 14-fold higher concentrations, respectively, were seen in serum as compared to liver. The mean concentration of PFOS and PFHxS in milk was only 0.8% and 0.6% of the reported mean serum level, respectively. Conclusions: The results of the present study show that several PFCs could be detected in human liver samples of subjects living in Tarragona. Concerning human milk, the mechanism by which PFCs are transferred from mother's blood to breast milk is still unclear. Considering that PFCs are strongly bound to the protein fraction in blood, the possibility of PFCs entering the milk and accumulating to levels observed in maternal plasma is limited. Recommendations and perspectives: Interestingly, the potential accumulation difference for PFCs with different chain lengths might be of great importance for risk assessment. Continuing studies on the distribution of different PFCs in human tissue are therefore justified. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",NA,10.1007/s11356-009-0178-5,Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Environmental Monitoring;Liver;Environmental Exposure;United States;Spain;Human;Milk;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;biomonitoring;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;LC-MS/MS;Catalonia;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;adult;liquid chromatography;perfluorohexanoic acid;liver;mass spectrometry;human;milk;Adult;aged;Aged;article;middle aged;Middle Aged;blood;metabolism;octanoic acid derivative;PFOA;body condition;decanoic acid derivative;Decanoic Acids;hexanoic acid derivative;breast milk;acid;Tissue distribution;Catalonia (Spain);PFCs;Octanoic Acids;statistics;Hexanoic Acids;Humanities;Humanism;Milk Ejection,NA,NA

To elucidate the distribution patterns of PFAAs using multi-matrices, the effects of spatial-temporal factors on the partition behaviors of PFAAs were investigated in different riverine environments in the downtown area of Nanjing, East China. Predominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), sum PFAAs (∑PFAAs) in the water phase were with concentrations of 0.8˜274.6 ng/L, characteristically higher in the dry season and lower in the wet season. The composition profiles in sediments (∑PFAAs 0.8˜11.4 ng/g dry weight) differed from that in water, being with a larger proportion of longer-chain PFAAs. The main sources of PFAAs in water were identified as industrial discharge, uncontrolled sewage discharge or WWTP effluents, surface runoff and nonpoint sources. The discharge fluxes of ∑PFAAs from Nanjing City can reach at 916.5 g/d for the Qinhuai River and 134.1 g/d for WWTPs along the Yangtze River.

Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was performed following extraction of urine (4 mL) using mixed-mode (cation and C8) solid-phase cartridges. Only 20 mu L of the 250 mu L extract was injected, leaving sufficient volume for other assays important in DFSA cases. Three ion transitions were chosen for confirmatory purposes. As ketamine and norketamine (including their stable isotopes) are available as reference standards, the assay was additionally validated for quantification purposes to study elimination of the drug and primary metabolite following a small oral dose of ketamine (50 mg) in 6 volunteers. Dehydronorketamine, a secondary metabolite, was also analyzed qualitatively to determine whether monitoring could improve retrospective detection of administration. The detection limit for ketamine and norketamine was 0.03 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively, and these compounds could be confirmed in urine for up to 5 and 6 days, respectively.

Little is known regarding the toxicity and bioaccumulation of newer AFFF formulations containing novel PFAS. To mimic maternal transfer of PFAS, prefertilization rainbow trout eggs were exposed to three PFAS using novel methodologies. Batches of unfertilized oocytes were exposed for 3 h to 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 µg/ml separately to perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid, or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid in either coelomic fluid or Cortland's solution. After exposure, the gametes were fertilized and rinsed with dechlorinated water. Egg yolk was aspirated from a subset of fertilized eggs for PFAS quantification. Each PFAS was detected in yolks of eggs exposed to the respective PFAS, and yolk concentrations were directly proportional to concentrations in aqueous media to which they were exposed. Exposure in coelomic fluid or Cortland's solution resulted in similar concentrations of PFAS in egg yolks. Ratios of PFAS concentrations in oocytes to concentrations in exposure media (oocyte fluid ratios) were <0.99 when exposed from 0.01 to 10 µg/ml and <0.45 when exposed from 0.1 to 10 µg/ml for both media and all three PFAS, demonstrating that the water solubility of the chemicals was relatively great. Prefertilization exposure of eggs effectively introduced PFAS into unfertilized egg yolk. This method provided a means of mimicking maternal transfer to evaluate toxicity to developing embryos from an early stage. This method is more rapid and efficient than injection of individual fertilized eggs and avoids trauma from inserting needles into eggs.

However, the sources, spatiotemporal variations, and fluxes of PFAAs under water diversion projects remain unclear. Here we report patterns of 18 PFAA compounds in the surface water at 14 sites of a dual-source water diversion project (Wangyu River) connecting the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake in China. We found multiple contamination hotspots with PFHxA and PFOA dominantly originating from industrial and domestic sources during water diversion from the Yangtze River to Taihu Lake. During the severe flooding in summer 2020, PFAA concentrations ranged from 82.0 to 114.0 ng L−1, while the concentrations and relative contributions of individual perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) increased along the mainstream due to the tributaries’ contribution and high contamination level in the lake. Based on the spatiotemporal patterns of PFAA pollution, the flux of total PFAAs including both dissolved-phase and SS-phase into Taihu Lake was estimated as 26.6 kg in January 2020 as a reference value for water diversion.

Significantly higher perfluorooctanoate concentrations were found in the air around the ski resorts in winter (n = 33, p < 0.05). The i-PFASs were stable in the needle, and the short-chain PFASs in the needle could be ascribed to both air and root uptake.

Here, we developed an analytical method for the expanded analysis of negative and positive ion mode PFAS in fish tissues. Eight variations of extraction solvents and clean-up protocols were first tested to recover 70 AFFF-derived PFAS from the fish matrix. Anionic, zwitterionic, and cationic PFAS displayed the best responses with methanol-based ultrasonication methods. The response of long-chain PFAS was improved for extracts submitted to graphite filtration alone compared with those involving solid-phase extraction. The validation included an assessment of linearity, absolute recovery, matrix effects, accuracy, intraday/interday precision, and trueness. The method was applied to a set of freshwater fish samples collected in 2020 in the immediate vicinity (creek, n = 15) and downstream (river, n = 15) of an active fire-training area at an international civilian airport in Ontario, Canada. While zwitterionic fluorotelomer betaines were major components of the subsurface AFFF source zone, they were rarely detected in fish, suggesting limited bioaccumulation potential. PFOS largely dominated the PFAS profile, with record-high concentrations in brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans) from the creek (16000–110,000 ng/g wet weight whole-body). These levels exceeded the Canadian Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines (FEQG) for PFOS pertaining to the Federal Fish Tissue Guideline (FFTG) for fish protection and Federal Wildlife Diet Guidelines (FWiDG) for the protection of mammalian and avian consumers of aquatic biota. Perfluorohexane sulfonamide and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate were among the precursors detected at the highest levels (maximum of ∼340 ng/g and ∼1100 ng/g, respectively), likely reflecting extensive degradation and/or biotransformation of C6 precursors originally present in AFFF formulations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163103,Biochemistry;PFAS;Fish;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Sulfur compounds;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;analytic method;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Extraction;Mammals;Phase separation;chemical compound;fish;solid phase extraction;Tissue;water;Aqueous film forming foams;Aqueous film-forming foam;polyfluoroalkyl substance;Precursor;Precursors;metabolism;Ontario;biotransformation;sulfonamide;degradation;Fishes;polymer;Water;Positive ions;mammal;Smegmamorpha;Ecological risks;Water Pollutants;graphite;Chemical;fluorotelomer sulfonic acids;Aquatic biota;biofilm;Fish tissue;Fluorotelomers;Ecological risk;airport;Airports;analytical method;air transportation;Airport;Airport security;Aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs);Civilian airports;fluorotelomer betaines;Zwitterionics,NA,NA

However, little is known regarding the levels of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in feathers and the applicability of these structures for the biomonitoring of these compounds. In the present study, we report the extent to which feathers are suitable for monitoring PFAA concentrations in the blood plasma of an insectivorous songbird model species, the great tit (Parus major), settled at and in the vicinity of a fluorochemical plant in Antwerp, Belgium. For most of the target analytes (out of the 15 investigated), the feather PFAA concentrations near the plant are the highest ever reported in free-living birds. As PFAA concentrations did not differ in the adjacent sites, no pollution gradient with distance from the plant was observed. In addition, the PFAA concentrations were not associated with the age and sex of the birds. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) concentrations were significantly higher in P. major feathers than in blood plasma, but for most other PFAAs, these differences were not observed. The concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and PFOA in P. major feathers and plasma were significantly and positively correlated when combining data from all sites but often not at individual sites. This result was likely caused by lower sample sizes at the individual sites and the use of matrices that represent different time periods. Our results suggest that P. major feathers cannot be used to estimate PFOA and PFOS concentrations in blood plasma, except when there is a great deal of variation in pollutant concentrations among sites/individual birds. Both matrices represent different time frames, providing complementary information on environmental PFAA concentrations, as illustrated by the observation that more PFAA compounds could be detected in P. major feathers than in blood plasma.

Considerable attention has been given to monitoring PFAS in the aquatic environment, however, few investigations have done so using freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates (BMIs). As these bottom-dwelling animals are known to bioconcentrate exogenous pollutants to a high degree, studying their PFAS levels may provide a more integrated view of PFAS contamination in the aquatic environment. In this study, BMIs, sediment, and surface water were collected from two streams in the Hudson River Watershed (one historically-impacted by PFAS) and analyzed for 44 PFAS using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to confirm the identities of quantitated analytes. Across all matrices, 17 analytes were detected with PFOA dominating in surface water and PFOS in sediment/BMIs. PFOS bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of PFOA and ranged from 857 to 5151 L kg−1 across different BMI taxa. While PFAS concentrations in surface water and sediment were not excessively high, elevated levels were still measured in most BMI taxa. This observation suggests that the extent of PFAS contamination in a local system may be severely underestimated if only surface water and sediment are used for monitoring. Moreover, these findings have relevance for human exposure assessment considering BMIs are the primary food source of many fish. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132830,Biochemistry;Biomonitoring;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Rivers;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Chromatography;United States;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;biological monitoring;controlled study;bioaccumulation;contamination;environmental monitoring;pollutant;chemical substance;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;concentration (composition);Emerging pollutants;marine environment;alkanesulfonic acid;high performance liquid chromatography;liquid chromatography;solid phase extraction;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;mass spectrometry;human;ultra performance liquid chromatography;polyfluoroalkyl substance;limit of quantitation;chromatography by mobile phase;limit of detection;Environmental monitoring;Analytical chemistry;aquatic environment;River pollution;sampling;particle size;algal bloom;Sediments;evaporation;centrifugation;fresh water;calibration;Water;River watersheds;watershed;Fresh Water;crayfish;surface water;Water Pollutants;Elevated level;Sediment;taxonomy;isotope;Chemical;Aquatic environments;practice guideline;Liquid;retention time;Watersheds;Surface water;macroinvertebrate;stream (river);ammonium acetate;bicarbonate;polypropylene;freshwater;exposure assessment;ammonium bicarbonate;Benthic macro invertebrates;deionized water;downstream concentration;engulfing;eutrophication;filtering operation;gas flow rate;hellgrammite;Hudson river;Hudson River;hudson river watershed;industrial discharge;minimum reporting limit;orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry;pennies;performance;perpolyfluoroalkyl substance;scraping;signal intensity;Trichoptera;upstream concentration,NA,NA

This study quantifies the release of two preemergent herbicides, metolachlor and pen-dimethalin, to the atmosphere as gas- and particle-phase species during soil incorporation operations. Fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and gas-phase samples were collected at three sampling heights during herbicide disking into the soil in Davis, CA, in May 2000 and May 2001 using filter/PUF sampling. Quartz fiber filters (QFFs) were used in May 2000, and Teflon membrane filters (TMFs) were used in May 2001. The field data were combined with laboratory filter/PUF partitioning experiments to account for adsorption to the filter surfaces and quantify the mass of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-bound herbicides in the field samples. Laboratory results indicate a significant adsorption of metolachlor, but not pendimethalin, to the quartz filter surfaces. Metolachlor partitioning to PM<sub>2.5</sub> collected on TMF filters resulted in corrected PM23 field partition coefficient values, K<sub>p,corr</sub> = C<sub>p</sub>/ C<sub>g</sub> of &amp;ap; 10<sup>-3.5</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/μg, indicating its preference for the gas phase.

An increase in pendimethalin enrichment at a height of 5 m suggests winnowing of finer, more sorptive soil components with corresponding higher transport potential. Pendimethalin was enriched in the PM<sub>2.5</sub> samples by up to a factor of 250 compared to the field soil, indicating that further research on the processes controlling the generation of PM-bound herbicides during agricultural operations is warranted to enable prediction of off-site mass fluxes by this mechanism.",NA,10.1021/es049210s,Agricultural equipment;Agriculture;Herbicides;Oxide minerals;Partition coefficient (Chemistry);Surface chemistry,NA,NA

The occurrence and distribution of 21 PFASs in liver tissues with tumors (n = 55) and without tumors (n = 55) are investigated in this study. Eleven perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and five perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were detected at high frequencies (45.5%–100 %), while the detection frequencies of five perfluoroalkyl phosphate (PFPAs) were relatively lower (≤29.1 %). PFSAs and PFCAs accounted for up to 82.5%–92.7 % of the total PFASs. Although it was not found to be statistically significant, the concentrations of the total PFASs were slightly higher in the tumor liver samples (mean 64.3, range 5.70–303 ng/g) than those in the non-tumor liver samples (mean 62.7, range 4.08–240 ng/g).The perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA), and perfluorobutanesulphonate (PFBS) showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between the tumor and non-tumor liver samples, and the different distribution levels of these three PFASs may have been a consequence of oxidative stress. The total concentrations of PFASs in the three age groups were in the decreasing order of middle-aged people (45–60) > old people (>60) > young people (<45). The PFASs in females were generally lower than in males, which may have been related to women's special excretion methods (such as childbirth and breastfeeding).

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a prominent member of perfluoroalkyls, is known as a neurotoxicant in developing brain and affects behavior and motor activity. However, mechanism of neurotoxicity still remains unknown. In this study, we attempted to analyze apoptotic effects of PFOS on developing neuron. Cerebellar granule cells derived from 7-day old SD rats and grown in culture for additional 7 days were used to mimic postnatal day (PND)-14 conditions. PFOS exposure increased ROS production, which was blocked by ROS inhibitor, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). PFOS selectively induced dose-dependent translocations of PKC-α, -βII and -eopen among PKC isozymes tested. The translocation of these specific PKC isozymes was blocked by NAC. A panel of different approaches was utilized to detect apoptotic effects. PFOS induced caspase-3 activity and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner, which were blocked by pretreatment of NAC. These apoptotic effects were further confirmed by TUNEL staining. Increases of caspase-3 activity and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation were dampened by the inhibition of PKC isozymes using siRNA technique. Taken together, our results suggest that PFOS may induce apoptosis of cerebellar granule cells via a ROS-mediated PKC signaling pathway. PKC signal transduction pathway is pivotal in learning and memory and apoptosis of neuronal cells is a critical event in neurotoxicity. Thus, this study may contribute to understand a new mechanistic aspect of PFOS-induced neurotoxicities. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.neuro.2012.01.017,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Antioxidants;Animals;Oxidative Stress;Rats;Cells;Cultured;Signal Transduction;Protein Kinase C;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;animal tissue;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;article;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;priority journal;long term potentiation;animal cell;rat;signal transduction;cerebellum;Cerebellum;Neurons;nucleotide sequence;enzyme activity;Cell Survival;genetic transfection;Transfection;caspase 3;cell culture;cell viability;cytotoxicity;apoptosis;Apoptosis;cell proliferation;reactive oxygen metabolite;Reactive Oxygen Species;Isoenzymes;learning;granule cell;Rattus;cell growth;gene translocation;Neurotoxicity Syndromes;protein kinase C alpha;protein kinase C beta;Protein Transport;protein kinase C;cell fractionation;Caspase 3;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;Sprague-Dawley;acetylcysteine;fluorescence microscopy;ROS;DNA fragmentation;Cerebellar granule cell;DNA Fragmentation;Enzyme Activation;In Situ Nick-End Labeling;memory;Protein kinase C;protein kinase C beta II;protein kinase C delta;protein kinase C epsilon;protein kinase C lambda;RNA Interference;Sulfones,NA,NA

Mercury concentrations in arctic char muscle tissue were comparable to those of char in other Arctic lakes, while the total amount of PFCs was below reported levels for remote lakes in the Arctic and elsewhere. Stable isotope and stomach content analyses were made to investigate the feeding ecology of the Pingualuk Lake arctic char population and indicated the possibility of multiple feeding groups.

However, both arctic char populations exhibit differential variation of their allele families. Physical characteristics determined for Lake Pingualuk revealed that the water column was inversely stratified beneath the ice and extremely transparent to visible and ultraviolet radiation. The highest mercury concentrations (3-6 pg mL-1 TH g) occurred just beneath the ice surface in each lake.

In this study, three kinds of fishes with different fat contents were selected, and the bioaccessibility of PFAS during cooking treatment (steaming and frying) was evaluated using in vitro gastrointestinal simulation with gastric lipase addition. The results showed that related to their molecular structures, the bioaccessibility of an individual PFAS varied greatly, ranging from 26.0 to 108.1%. Cooking can reduce the bioaccessibility of PFAS, and steaming is more effective than oil-frying; one of the possible reasons for this result is that the PFAS is trapped in protein aggregates after heat treatment. Fish lipids and cooking oil ingested with meals exert different effects on the bioaccessibility of PFAS, which may be related to the state of the ingested lipid/oil and the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids. Gastric lipase boosted the release of long-chain PFAS during in vitro digestion, indicating that the degree of lipolysis considerably influences the bioaccessibility of hydrophobic PFAS.

Similar enantiomer distributions of chiral organohalogen compounds (OHCs) such as hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and chlorinated biphenyls (CBs) were previously reported amongst wild canoidea species. Therefore, we investigated the comparative enantioselective biotransformation capabilities for chiral OHCs between captive West Greenland (Baffin Bay) sled dogs (Canis familiaris) and free-ranging polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Baffin Island, Canada, to understand bioaccumulation dynamics of individual enantiomers within top-predator species better, and to examine the feasibility for cross-species comparisons of enantiomer distributions. Enantiomer fractions (EFs) and enantiomer-specific biomagnification factors (BMFs) of OHCs were determined in West Greenland sled dog adipose, liver, thyroid, adrenal, and brain tissues after exposure to OHC-contaminated minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) blubber (exposed cohort) or pork fat (control cohort) for 20 months. Sled dogs biotransformed chiral OHCs enantioselectively. BMFs of (+)-oxychlordane, (-)-alpha-HCH, and (-)-CB 149 were 1.8-fold, 3.3-fold and 2.5-fold greater than their antipodes, respectively, leading to an enrichment of these enantiomers in sled dog adipose tissue relative to minke whale blubber. Non-racemic distributions of OHCs in two toxicologically sensitive tissues, thyroid and adrenal glands, are also reported for the first time. Except for CB 91, all OHC EFs were similar between Baffin Island polar bears and captive sled dogs. A comparison of enantiomer-specific BMFs revealed similar bioaccumulation dynamics for oxychlordane and heptachlor epoxide between the two species, but contrasting results for alpha-HCH, despite similar alpha-HCH EFs. Enantiomer-specific BMFs provide more reliable information for making cross-species comparisons of enantiomer distributions in biota than EFs alone, particularly for related species (e.g., canoidea).

Consequently, major concerns have been raised worldwide regarding the management of this pollutant in aquatic ecosystems. To thoroughly understand PFOA's toxic effects on aquatic organisms, systematic investigations were conducted on the cellular responses of Microcystis aeruginosa to the environmental concentrations of PFOA under various concentrations as well as phosphorus (P) conditions (concentrations and forms). The results showed that P conditions remarkably affected cyanobacterial growth as well as photosynthetic pigment content, triggered oxidative stress to disrupt the function and structure of the cell membrane, and caused changes in the extracellular and intracellular contents of microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Furthermore, PFOA (100 μg/L) was absorbed by cyanobacterial cells through the stimulation of the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by M. aeruginosa. After entering the cyanobacterial cells, PFOA inhibited photosynthesis, reduced P absorption, induced oxidative damage, lead to a loss of cell integrity evident in scanning electron microscope images, and increased mcyA gene expression to promote MC-LR production. Moreover, the limited P concentration and forms conditions led to increased PFOA absorption by cyanobacterial cells, which further upregulated mcyA gene expression and increased the risk of MC-LR diffusion into the aquatic environment.

Calcium alginate beads with integrated Moringa oleifera (MO) seed powder were investigated as an alternative adsorbent for addressing these issues. The beads fabricated under different formulation conditions were evaluated as a proof of concept for their adsorption performance of two PFAS compounds (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS)) that are frequently found in PFAS-contaminated water.

Signal transduction studies showed that PFOS exposure significantly elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Bax, cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3, indicating the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway was activated.

Taken together, these results indicate that mitochondria play an important role in PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity. © 2017",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.08.070,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Antioxidants;Animals;Article;Liver;Oxidative Stress;Rats;Signal Transduction;animal;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;protein;chemical compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;oxidative stress;gene;gene expression;toxicity;Hepatotoxicity;liver;liver toxicity;pathology;human;body weight;toxicology;metabolism;animal model;rat;protein expression;signal transduction;glutathione;catalase;glutathione disulfide;enzyme;enzyme activity;caspase 3;immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein;tumor necrosis factor;Perfluorooctanesulphonate;Mitochondria;mitochondrion;superoxide dismutase;apoptosis;Apoptosis;Oxidative stress;drug effects;inducible nitric oxide synthase;nitric oxide;Nitric oxide;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II;reactive oxygen metabolite;Reactive Oxygen Species;reactive oxygen species;cytochrome c;Enzymes;antioxidant;Sprague Dawley rat;Rattus;liver enzyme;Caspase 3;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha;ultrastructure;Molecular mechanism;Sprague-Dawley;NF-kappa B;Signal transduction;enzyme blood level;caspase 9;protein Bax;anatomy;Superoxide dismutase activities;Antioxidant defence;Apoptotic pathways;CASP3 protein;CASP9 protein;Caspase 9;Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS);injuries;NF-κB/TNF-α;NOS2 protein,NA,NA

Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a man-made fluorosurfactant and global pollutant, has been shown to induce oxidative stress in various cell types. Oxidative stress plays a key role in leading several placental diseases including preeclampsia (PE), gestational diabetes, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and intrauterine growth restriction. Recently, epigenetic regulation such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, and microRNAs (miRNAs), are shown to be associated with oxidative stress as well as pregnancy complications such as PE. However, whether PFOS exerts its detrimental effects in the placenta through epigenetics remains to be unveiled. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of PFOS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in first trimester human trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo) and whether epigenetic regulation is involved in this process. When treated with a range of PFOS doses at 24 and 48 h, even at 10 mu M, it significantly increased the ROS production and decreased gene and protein expression, respectively, of the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 (p < 0.001; p < 0.05), DNMT3A (p < 0.001; p < 0.05), and DNMT3B (p < 0.01; p < 0.01) and the sirtuins, for example, SIRT1 (p < 0.001; p < 0.001) and SIRT3 (p < 0.001; p < 0.05), while reducing global DNA methylation (p < 0.01) and increasing protein lysine acetylation (p < 0.001) as compared to vehicle controls. Interestingly, PFOS (10 mu M) significantly increased miR29-b (p < 0.01), which has been previously reported to be associated with PE. The observed epigenetic effects were shown to be dependent on the expression of miR-29b, as knockdown of miR-29b significantly alters the gene and protein expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, SIRT1, and SIRT3 and ROS production as well as global DNA methylation and protein acetylation.

However, PFASs conversion or conjugation to other substances in rice grown on PFASs polluted soil has not been explored clearly. These unknown transformed or conjugated products of PFOA and PFOS could be harmful to human health. The restriction factor in evaluating the possible transformation of PFOA and PFOS is mainly attributed to the lack of an efficient method for screening PFOA and PFOS and their related metabolites. To circumvent this challenge, we established a non-targeted screening method by combining a fluoro-cotton fiber-based solid phase extraction (FC-SPE) and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to monitor the formation of possible organic fluorine compounds from rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown on PFASs. We synthesized fluoro-cotton fibers to serve as the FC-SPE packing material and characterized by field-emission scanning electron-microscope, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The optimal extraction conditions for the prepared FC-SPE were investigated. The performance of FC-SPE in LC-MS analysis was validated by linearity, precision, recovery, and matrix effect. Then the FC-SPE combined with LC-HRMS was used to specifically capture organic fluorine compounds from complex matrices via F–F interaction, including rice seedlings grown in PFOA and PFOS polluted soil and soil samples. By the established FC-SPE LC-HRMS method, in total 429 features were found as the possible organic fluorine compounds from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil among the 1781 features from the rice seedlings. Finally, we employed a13C metabolic tracing analysis of organic fluorine compounds in combination with the FC-SPE LC-HRMS method to further identify the features that detected from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil. The final result indicated that there were not any new organic fluorine metabolites screened out from rice grown in PFOA or PFOS polluted soil. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114801,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;controlled study;chemistry;hydrogen bond;perfluoro compound;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;solid phase extraction;perfluorohexanoic acid;mass spectrometry;human;rice;soil;organofluorine derivative;Soil;soil pollution;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluoroheptanoic acid;perfluoropentanoic acid;perfluorotetradecanoic acid;food intake;octanoic acid;limit of quantitation;perfluorobutanoic acid;extraction method;aqueous solution;Caprylates;chemical structure;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy;carbon 13;perflubutane;Oryza;fluorine;fluorine derivative;Fluorine;Fluorine Compounds;plant growth;retention time;rhizosphere;matrix effect;field emission scanning electron microscopy;Fluorous cotton materials;High-resolution mass spectrometry;Non-targeted screening;price dynamics;seedling;sensitivity;specificity;X ray photoemission spectroscopy;Oryza sativa,NA,NA

PFASs have been detected in different environmental matrices and have been found to bioaccumulate in all trophic levels. The adverse effects that are associated with PFAS exposure include reduced body weight, increased liver weight, hepatocellular hypertrophy, a decrease in serum cholesterol and triglycerides. This project aims to characterize the metabolic changes in lipid metabolism in the liver after exposure to one of the well-studied PFASs, the perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), during the embryo development using the domestic chicken as a model organism. The characterization of the metabolic changes was done by conducting both quantitative lipidomic analysis and semi-quantitative global profiling on extracted lipids from liver homogenates from a former related project looking at fatty acid profiles. The extracted lipids were analyzed using UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS. In the quantitative analysis, the PFOS-treated groups (0.1 ug/g and 1.0 ug/g)exhibited higher lipid concentrations when compared with the solvent control group (5% DMSO) and the untreated group leading to the conclusion that PFOS exposure disrupts the lipid metabolism. When comparing the lipid concentrations between the two PFOS-treated groups (0.1 ug/g and 1.0 ug/g), the majority of the lipids exhibited higher lipid concentrations in the 1.0 ug/g PFOS-treated groups leading to the conclusion that the effect PFOS has on the lipid metabolism is dose dependent.

Consequently, the principal exposure routes of PFAS have been broadly studied, leading to the conclusion that dietary exposure (more specifically, the consumption of fish and seafood) was one of their main contributors. Thus, developing an analytical method that determines the level of PFAS in fish and seafood has become a relevant subject. In this work, a previous analytical method has been optimized to determine 12 PFAS in fish muscle from salmon, tuna, cod, hake, sardine, anchovy, and sole, as well as in seven different seafood species (i.e., cuttlefish, octopus, squid, shrimp, Norway lobster, prawn, and mussel) by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Subsequently, the PFAS profile of the different species was studied to determine if it was consistent with that previously reviewed in the literature and to know the most relevant contribution of PFAS for each species. Finally, human exposure to PFAS through their consumption was estimated by the daily intake for seven different age/gender groups. PFAS were obtained from 0.014 to 0.818 ng g−1 wet weight in fish samples. Sardines, anchovies, and soles presented the highest PFAS levels. However, cod samples also showed some PFAS traces. Regarding seafood, PFAS levels range from 0.03 to 36.7 ng g−1 dry weight for the studied species. A higher concentration of PFAS has been found in the cephalopods' spleens and the crustaceans' heads. PFOS and PFBS were the predominant compounds in each seafood species, respectively. On the other hand, in the case of mussels, which are the less polluted species of the study, contamination by longer-chained PFAS was also observed. Finally, the total intake of PFAS due to fish and shellfish consumption for the Spanish adult population was estimated at 17.82 ng day−1.

This study aimed to investigate the toxicity and detoxification mechanism of PFOS in this protozoan. PFOS did not show prominent toxic effects on T. thermophila. Cell viability of T. thermophila can be concentration-dependently increased by PFOS. PFOS also increased the stability of cell membranes and the activity of lysosomes. However, PFOS inhibited efflux transporter activities. Most of the PFOS amount remained in the culture medium during the culture periods. Only a low amount of PFOS was absorbed by cells, where PFOS molecules were mainly combined with membrane proteins. The expressions of four membrane protein genes involved in transporting xenobiotics were analyzed by real time-PCR. The gene abcg25 was significantly up-regulated. The growth of abcg25 gene knockout protozoans under PFOS treatment was slightly inhibited. However, the amount of PFOS adsorbed by the knockout protozoans showed no significant difference from the Wild-type protozoans. We concluded that the ABCG25 protein might play a key role in preventing PFOS from entering the cell or being exported from the cells to protect T. thermophila against PFOS.

Liquid-liquid extraction processes can remove them from water; however, the hydrophobic and oleophobic properties of PFOA lead to the low extraction efficiency and severe emulsification, especially for the ppm-levels concentration of PFOA. Therefore, we introduced ionic liquid (IL) methyltrioctylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([A336][NTf2]) as extractant into octanol. We found that using hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as an extractant caused severe and stable emulsion. In comparison, [A336][NTf2] could suppress the emulsification with high extraction efficiency. The extraction performance of PFOA was examined as a function of various parameters. The results showed that the extraction efficiency was strongly dependent on the concentration of IL and aqueous pH. Further research revealed the extraction mechanisms at the molecular-level, and density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation agreed with the trends in the experiment. We determined that the extraction efficiency of PFOA from water could be up to 88.21 wt% for the optimized condition, indicating that the extraction system of [A336][NTf2] + octanol was efficient for separating PFOA from the diluted aqueous solution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124091,wastewater;Article;nonhuman;controlled study;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Extraction;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;high performance liquid chromatography;drinking water;Potable water;extraction method;PFOA;waste water management;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy;liquid liquid extraction;biodegradation;Efficiency;waste component removal;Emulsification;emulsion;octanol;Biodegradation;Wastewater;pollutant removal;wastewater treatment;density functional theory;Density functional theory;Liquid-liquid extraction;DFT;Molecular dynamics;cetrimide;Diluted aqueous solutions;Extraction efficiencies;Extraction mechanisms;Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide;ionic liquid;Ionic liquids;Liquid-liquid extraction process;MD simulation;Optimized conditions,NA,NA

Zooplankton of different size was seasonally sampled for two years in three deep Italian subalpine lakes (Maggiore, Como, Iseo) with the aim of determining the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), DDT, and PCB, and assessing the seasonality impacts on contaminants concentrations. In general, Lake Maggiore showed the highest concentrations for each group of contaminants, with mean values of 7.6 ng g(-1) ww for PFAS, 65.0 ng g(-1) dw for DDT, and 65.5 ng g(-1) dw for PCB. When considering the composition pattern, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was detected in 96% of the samples and it was the predominant PFAS compound in all of the lakes. pp' DDE was the most detected congener among DDTs and their metabolites, while for PCBs, the prevalent group was hexa-CB that constituted 35.4% of the total PCB contamination. A seasonal trend was highlighted for all contaminant groups with concentrations in colder months greater than in spring and summer; it was evident that the contaminant concentrations were more dependent from seasonality than from size, trophic levels, and taxa composition of zooplankton. Principal component analysis showed that one of the main driver for the accumulation of most of the studied contaminants is their lipophilicity, except for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and octachlorobiphenyl.",NA,10.3390/w11091901,Seasons,NA,NA

In this work, special meteorological conditions were utilized to quantify atmospheric emissions of Zurich City, Switzerland with a dual approach of modeling and field measurements. During high pressure systems in summer, a stable nocturnal boundary layer is formed in which pollutants are enriched. For volatile PFASs, a diel pattern of high concentrations in the night and low concentrations during the day was observed in Zurich, which is likely due to the atmospheric boundary layer dynamics. These results enable to model the emission source strength of Zurich City with a multimedia mass balance model in an accompanying paper.

However, no study has been reported about the effects of different arsenic species on the joint toxicity of arsenic and PFOA to soil invertebrates. In this study, four arsenic species were selected, including arsenite (As(III)), arsenate (As(V)), monomethylarsonate (MMA), and dimethylarsinate (DMA). Earthworms Eisenia fetida were exposed to soils spiked with sublethal concentrations of PFOA, different arsenic species, and their binary mixtures for 56 days. The bioaccumulation and biotransformation of pollutants, as well as eight biomarkers in organisms, were assayed. The results indicated that the coexistence of PFOA and different arsenic species in soils could enhance the bioavailability of arsenic species while reducing the bioavailability of PFOA, and inhibit the arsenic biotransformation process in earthworms. Responses of most biomarkers in joint treatments of PFOA and As(III)/As(V) showed more significant variations compared with those in single treatments, indicating higher toxicity to the earthworms. The Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) index was used to integrate the multi-biomarker responses, and the results also exhibited enhanced toxic effects in combined treatments of inorganic arsenic and PFOA. In comparison, both the biomarker variations and IBR values were lower in joint treatments of PFOA and MMA/DMA. Then the toxic interactions in the binary mixture systems were characterized by using a combined method of IBR and Effect Addition Index. The results revealed that the toxic interactions of the PFOA/arsenic mixture in earthworms depended on the different species of arsenic. The combined exposure of PFOA with inorganic arsenic led to a synergistic interaction, while that with organic arsenic resulted in an antagonistic response.

PFOS acts as a peroxisome proliferator in rodents, which occurs subsequent to activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α). Activated PPAR-α up-regulates PPAR-α target genes, most of which are involved in lipid metabolism. Although several studies have investigated the effects of PFOS exposure on mammalian gene expression, there are few studies in avian species. To determine if PFOS is capable of activating avian PPAR-α, we exposed chicken embryo primary hepatocyte cultures (N = 3 independent cell cultures) to PFOS or fenofibrate, a mammalian PPAR-α agonist, and examined the expression of PPAR-α and PPAR-α target genes using quantitative real-time PCR. The target genes examined were peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), enoyl-Coenzyme A, hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl Coenzyme A dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme (BIEN), peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl thiolase (PKT), and malic enzyme (ME). All five target genes were induced in response to PFOS exposure and all of the target genes, except L-FABP, were induced in response to fenofibrate. PPAR-α mRNA expression was not altered by PFOS or fenofibrate. This study provides the first evidence that PFOS can induce PPAR-α-dependent transcriptional responses in an avian species and provides the first characterization of fenofibrate induced transcriptional responses in chicken embryo hepatocyte cultures. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Chemicals included perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) at 0, 80, 800, or 8000 ppb on a moss dry weight basis. Exposure to PFAS influenced final snout–vent length (SVL) and scaled mass index (SMI), a measure of relative body condition. Observed effects depended on species and chemical, but not concentration. Anurans exposed to PFOS, PFHxS (frogs only), and 6:2 FTS demonstrated reduced SVL versus controls, whereas salamanders exposed to 6:2 FTS showed increased SVL. Frogs exposed to PFHxS and 6:2 FTS and toads exposed to PFOS had increased SMI compared to controls; salamanders did not demonstrate effects. Concentrations of 6:2 FTS in substrate decreased substantially by 30 d, likely driven by microbial action. Perfluorooctane sulfonate had notable biota–sediment accumulation factors, but was still <1. Although a no-observable-effect concentration could not generally be determined, the lowest-observable-effect concentration was 50 to 120 ppb. Survival was not affected.

All the PFASs had a median concentration lower than 26.7 pg/L, representing the background levels in EA. The contamination of PFASs in EA was generally lower than in West Antarctica (WA), which might be due to the less on-site human activities in EA than in WA.

PFOA and PFOS concentrations in plankton ranged from 0.1 to 43 ng g(dw)(-1) and from 0.5 to 6.7 ng g(dw)(-1), respectively. The relative abundance of branched PFOA in the northern hemisphere was correlated with distance to North America, consistent with the historical production and coherent with previously reported patterns in seawater. The plankton samples showing the highest PFOS concentrations also presented the largest relative abundances of branched PFOS, suggesting a selective cycling/fractionation of branched PFOS in the surface ocean mediated by plankton. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for plankton were calculated for six PFASs, including short chain PFASs.

Available data have documented prevalence of studied OCECs in estuarine compartments from around the world, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia. Their spatiotemporal trends, vertical distributions in the water column, and multi-media partitioning are mainly dependent on anthropogenic impacts (e.g., production and consumption patterns, urbanization, industrialization, and waste treatment), hydrodynamics, meteorological conditions, characteristics of environmental media and the interactions with OCECs, and physiochemical properties of OCECs. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification have also been reported for many estuarine OCECs, which favor those with moderate hydrophobicity, considerable proteophilicity, and satisfactory resistance to environmental degradation and biological transformation.

The presence of PFASs mentioned were detected in all colonies studied, and concentration levels of these substances were sampling dependent. The highest concentration levels were observed in the case of PFPeA [1.34 and 3060 ng/g dry weight (dw)] and PFHxA (8.30–314 ng/g dw). This study confirms the exposure of wild bats to PFASs. © 2023, The Author(s).",NA,10.1038/s41598-023-49638-5,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Poland;nonhuman;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;adult;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;perfluorohexanoic acid;article;carboxylic acid;clinical article;dry weight;clothing;Water Pollutants;Chemical;drug toxicity;bat;Chiroptera;kitchen;Myotis myotis,NA,NA

Today's analytical methodologies using targeted approaches are not sufficient to determine the complete suite of PFAS present. To evaluate the presence of unknown PFAS, we investigated in this study the occurrence of an extended range of target PFAS in various species from the marine and terrestrial Norwegian environment, in relation to the extractable organofluorine (EOF), which yields the total amount of organofluorine. The results showed a varying presence of extractable fluorinated organics, with glaucous gull eggs, otter liver and polar bear plasma showing the highest EOF and a high abundance of PFAS as well. The targeted PFAS measurements explained 1% of the organofluorine for moose liver as the lowest and 94% for otter liver as the highest. PFCAs like trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, reported semi-quantitatively), played a major role in explaining the organic fluorine present. Emerging PFAS as the perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS), was found in polar bear plasma in quantifiable amounts for the first time, confirming earlier detection in arctic species far removed from emission sources. To enable a complete organic fluorine mass balance in wildlife, new approaches are needed, to uncover the presence of new emerging PFAS as cyclic- or ether PFAS together with chlorinated PFAS as well as fluorinated organic pesticides and pharmaceuticals. © 2022 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107640,PFAS;Fluorocarbons;Top predator;Animals;Article;Norway;animal;Arctic;concentration (parameter);environmental chemical;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;Mammals;marine environment;perfluoroalkyl substance;source apportionment;wildlife;terrestrial species;limit of detection;organofluorine;wild animal;environmental assessment;fluorine;trifluoroacetic acid;perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate;Fluorine;Polar bears;Ursidae;bear;Industrial emissions;industrial emission;Wild;'current;nature conservation;Organofluorine;otter;Otters;Extractables;mass balance;Organic fluorine;Trifluoroacetic acid;Excimer lasers;extractable organofluorine;Extractable organofluorine;Top predators,NA,NA
