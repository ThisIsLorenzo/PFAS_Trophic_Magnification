Recent reviews have encouraged the use of bioaccumulation models as screening tools for assessing TMFs for emerging chemicals of concern. The present study used a food web bioaccumulation model to estimate TMFs for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a riverine system. The uncertainty associated with model predicted TMFs was evaluated against realistic ranges for model inputs (water and sediment PCB contamination) and variation in environmental, physiological, and ecological parameters included within the model. Finally, the model was used to explore interactions between spatial heterogeneity in water and sediment contaminant concentrations and theoretical movement profiles of different fish species included in the model. The model predictions of magnitude of TMFs conformed to empirical studies. There were differences in the relationship between the TMF and the octanol-water partitioning coefficient (KOW) depending on the modeling approach used; a parabolic relationship was predicted under deterministic scenarios, whereas a linear TMF-KOW relationship was predicted when the model was run stochastically. Incorporating spatial movements by fish had a major influence on the magnitude and variation of TMFs. Under conditions where organisms are collected exclusively from clean locations in highly heterogeneous systems, the results showed bias toward higher TMF estimates, for example the TMF for PCB 153 increased from 2.7 to 5.6 when fish movement was included. Small underestimations of TMFs were found where organisms were exclusively sampled in contaminated regions, although the model was found to be more robust to this sampling condition than the former for this system.

Tissue-specific bioaccumulation characteristics of 39 PFAS, including 19 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), 8 emerging PFAS, and 12 PFAA precursors, were investigated, and the levels of some biochemical indicators were determined. The highest PFAS concentrations were found in the liver [215.97 ng/g dry weight (dw)] of Chinese toads, followed by gonads (135.42 ng/g dw) and intestine (114.08 ng/g dw). A similar tissue distribution profile was found between legacy and emerging PFAS in the toads, and the occurrence of two emerging PFAS, 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-propanoate (HFPO-DA) and 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA) in the amphibians were for the first time reported. Field-based bioaccumulation factors of HFPO-DA were higher than perfluorooctanoic acid, indicating the higher bioaccumulation potential of this emerging PFAS than the legacy C8 compound. Males had significantly higher gonad PFAS levels than females while estradiol levels in gonads increased with increasing concentrations of certain PFAS (e.g., 6:2 H-PFESA), implying that PFAS may trigger estrogenic effects in the toads, especially for male toads. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.3c02660,Biochemistry;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Bioaccumulation;Tissue Distribution;China;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;animal experiment;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;animal tissue;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;perfluorooctanoic acid;quality control;alkanesulfonic acid;sulfonate;Tissue;liver;water;tissue distribution;organofluorine;intestine;lake;Lakes;bay;dry weight;Bays;estradiol;estradiol blood level;watershed;physicochemical property;substitution reaction;Water Pollutants;gonad;Chemical;3;Bioconcentration;3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoate;ammonium 2;Amphibian;ADONA;amphibians;Anhui;bioconcentration;Bufo gargarizans;Bufonidae;Chaohu Lake;Cl-PFESA;Gonad;H-PFESA;PFAS precursor;Polyfluoroalkyl substance precursor;sex hormone disorder;Sex hormone disorder;Sex hormones,NA,NA

Microplastics in surface waters can adsorb and desorb harmful chemicals such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Microplastics can accumulate across all tropic levels in the marine food web. The purpose of this research was to analyze the stomach and intestinal contents of stranded (Mississippi coast) bottlenose dolphins and sea turtles for the presence of microplastics and commonly found PFAS, PFOS, PFOA, and GenX. Gut contents were digested (10% KOH in 50% MeOH) and then analyzed for microplastics using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Pyro-GC-MS), Nile red microscopy, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. Digested sample filtrate was pre-concentrated using solid-phase extraction (SPE) before PFAS liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The PFOS extraction and analysis had 98.6% recovery when validated with certified pike‒perch fish reference material. The Nile red testing on most samples revealed the presence of microplastics (Table S1). The Pyro-GC-MS results from two samples confirmed the presence of the plasticizer acetamide. The Raman spectroscopy analysis indicated characteristic plastic peaks corresponding to polystyrene in one sample. PFOS (95.5 to 1,934.5 µg/kg) was detected in three dolphin stomach samples.

In this study, a systematic field campaign was carried out along Yarlung Tsangpo River, Nu River, Lancang River and Jinsha River, and 13 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were analyzed. The total concentrations of PFAAs in the river waters of the TP were in the range of 0.58–7.46 ng/L, containing a high proportion of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) with average values of 56.7 %. Elevated PFAA loadings were found for the midstream of Yarlung Tsangpo River in central Tibet. Geodetector results indicated that precipitation, solar radiation and vegetation type were the top three influential factors contributing to the observed spatial heterogeneity. When interactions with human activities were taken into account, the explanatory power was significantly enhanced and rose above 0.70, highlighting the increased risks for TP rivers from the combined effects of natural environments and anthropogenic activities. Risk assessments suggest a low risk is posed to the alpine aquatic ecosystems and human health. The discharge fluxes of PFAAs via riverine export were estimated at 94–425 kg/year, which is one to two orders of magnitude lower than their mass loadings in major rivers worldwide. Our study underlined the need for further attention to the increased risk of water resource quality on the central TP in the context of long-range transport, increased cryosphere melting and local emission. © 2022",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159026,Perfluoroalkyl acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Rivers;Article;Environmental Monitoring;China;Risk Assessment;ecosystem;Ecosystem;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;Organic pollutants;environmental monitoring;Health risks;water pollutant;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;spatial distribution;Spatial distribution;water pollution;procedures;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;Risks assessments;human;river water;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluoroheptanoic acid;perfluoropentanoic acid;perfluorobutanoic acid;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;organic pollutant;aquatic environment;River pollution;aquatic ecosystem;correlation analysis;public health;water resource;water supply;vegetation;perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid;polyfunctional group;human activity;River water;Water Pollutants;water quality;Water quality;Chemical;human impact (environment);Aquatic ecosystems;Tibet;human activities;cryosphere;Head waters;headwater;Heterogeneity assessment;Influencing factor;Influencing factors;Jinsha River;Mekong River;river ecosystem;solar radiation;Spatial heterogeneity;Tibetan Plateau;Water quality securities;Yarlung-Tsangpo River,NA,NA

The majority of investigations have examined total PFOS concentrations in wildlife and in toxicity testing, but isomer-specific monitoring studies are less common, and no laboratory-based study of PFOS isomer accumulation in fish has been reported. The present study examined accumulation and maternal transfer of PFOS isomers in zebrafish and tissue-specific accumulation of PFOS isomers in trout parr. A median lethal dose (LC50) of 22.2 and 2.5 mg/L was calculated for adult zebrafish and trout parr, respectively. A two-week PFOS exposure resulted in tissue-specific PFOS accumulation in trout, with maximum concentrations identified in the liver tissue (>50 mu g/g). Prior exposure to PFOS as alevin did not affect the accumulation of PFOS in tissues later in life. In both species, accumulation of branched PFOS isomers generally occurred to a lesser extent than linear PFOS, which may explain the relative deficiency of branched PFOS isomers in some aquatic species in the field. Analysis of exposed trout tissues indicated that isomer discrimination may occur at the level of elimination or uptake and elimination processes in the kidney or gill, respectively. When zebrafish underwent a reproductive cycle in the presence of PFOS, approximately 10% (wt) of the adult PFOS body burden was transferred to the developing embryos, resulting in a higher total PFOS concentration in eggs (116 +/- 13.3 mu g/g) than in the parent fish (72.1 +/- 7.6 mu g/g). The isomer profile in eggs was not significantly different from that of adults, suggesting that the maternal transfer of branched and linear PFOS isomers in fish is largely nonisomer specific.

Log Kd of PFAS tended to increase with increasing CF2 units of PFAS, and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and PFOS showed the highest log BAF value (> 3.0) in all fish species.

It is a persistent organic pollutant in the aquatic environment and poses a serious threat to aquatic organisms, as PFOS exposure can cause liver injury in a wide range of organisms. However, it is unclear whether PFOS exposure-induced hepatocellular injury in fish is associated with ROS-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In this study, various PFOS concentrations were applied to L8824 cells, a cell line of grass carp hepatocytes. The detrimental impacts of PFOS on oxidative stress, pyroptosis, lipid metabolism, and the discharge of inflammatory factors were examined. MCC950 and N-acetylcysteine were employed to hinder the PFOS-stimulated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species in L8824 cells, respectively. This study demonstrated that treatment with PFOS resulted in oxidative stress and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in L8824 cells. This led to increased expression levels of indicators related to pyroptosis, accompanied by the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression as well as downregulation of anti-inflammatory factors. In addition, following PFOS exposure, the expression levels of genes related to lipid synthesis were upregulated and lipid catabolism-related genes were downregulated. Surprisingly, both N-acetylcysteine and MCC950 interventions significantly reduced PFOS-induced L8824 cell pyroptosis and lipid metabolism disorders. In conclusion, this research demonstrated that PFOS drives NLRP3 inflammasome activation through oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species overload. This in turn leads to pyroptosis and lipid metabolism disorders. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.106839,Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Lipid Metabolism;Hepatocytes;animal;concentration (parameter);fluorocarbon;incubation time;nonhuman;controlled study;lipid;lipid metabolism;Lipids;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;pollution exposure;oxidative stress;gene expression;genetics;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;metabolism;animal cell;Western blotting;toxicity testing;real time polymerase chain reaction;experimental study;IC50;cell viability;cyprinid;bioinformatics;liver cell;apoptosis;protein protein interaction;reactive oxygen metabolite;Reactive Oxygen Species;perfluorooctane;immunofluorescence;enzyme inhibition;Water Pollutants;enzyme activation;Chemical;laboratory method;pyroptosis;Pyroptosis;acetylcysteine;Acetylcysteine;cryopyrin;disorders of lipid;fluorescence microscopy;grass carp;Grass carp hepatocyte;inflammasome;Inflammasomes;Inflammatory cytokines;L8824 cell line;Lipid metabolism;Lipid Metabolism Disorders;lipoprotein metabolism;NLR Family;Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein;Sulfones;Poaceae,NA,NA

To date, these studies have used precursor mass, retention time and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to identify and quantify amino acids. While this is a potentially powerful technique, we sought to adapt the method to time-of-flight (TOF)MS. A new application of a recently described liquid chromatographic separation method was coupled with TOFMS to employ accurate mass for qualitative identification; resulting in additional qualitative data not available with standard single quadrupole data. In the current study, we evaluated 25 physiological amino acids and one dipeptide that are routinely quantified in human plasma. Accuracy and precision of the method was evaluated by spiking human plasma with a mix of the 25 amino acids; in addition, the inclusion of a cation-exchange cleanup step was evaluated. The calibration curves were linear over a range from 1.56 to 400 mu M. The dynamic range was found to be within physiological levels for all amino acids analyzed. Accuracy and precision for most of the amino acids was between 80-120% spike recovery and < 10% relative standard deviation (RSD). The LC/MS technique described in this study relies on mass accuracy and is suitable for the quantitation of free amino acids in plasma.

One of the dedicated satellite missions is the CO2 measurement in the 1.6-mu m shortwave infrared spectra by the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) Thermal and Near Infrared Sensor for Carbon Observations-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) instrument. While this spectral region has unique advantages in detecting lower-trophosphere CO2, there are many challenges because it relies on accurate measurements of reflected solar radiance from Earth's surface. Therefore, the calibration of the TANSO-FTS CO2 has a direct impact on the CO2 retrievals and its long-term trends. Coincidently, the Suomi-NPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 1.6-mu m band spectrally overlaps with the TANSO-FTS CO2 band, and both satellites are in orbit with periodical simultaneous nadir overpass measurements. This study performs an intercomparison of VIIRS and the TANSO-FTS CO2 band in an effort to evaluate and improve the radiometric consistency. Understanding the differences provides feedback on how well the GOSAT TANSO-FTS is performing over time, which is critical to ensure a well-calibrated, stable, and bias-free CO2 product.",NA,10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0157.1,Absorption,NA,NA

The aim was to assess temporal trends and effects of regulatory measures. Results: PCBs (sum of 7 congeners) were highest in eggs from the North Sea island Trischen, i.e., 3,710 to 20,760 ng/g lipid weight [lw] compared to 2,530 to 11,650 ng/g lw on the North Sea island Mellum and 4,840 to 9,190 ng/g lw on the Baltic Sea island Heuwiese. During the study period, PCBs decreased significantly. Concentrations of PFOS ranged between 46 and 170 ng/g wet weight [ww] at Trischen, 39 to 99 ng/g ww at Mellum, and 20 to 159 ng/g ww at Heuwiese. Since 2000 and 2003, concentration levels decreased in eggs from Mellum and Heuwiese, respectively. Perfluorooctanoic acid was the dominant perfluorinated carboxylic acid in the North Sea eggs (Trischen 2.0 to 74 ng/g ww; Mellum 2.6 to 118 ng/g ww), whereas perfluoroundecanoate [PFUnA] and perfluorodecanoate [PFDA] (means 3.9 ± 3.6 ng/g and 2.9 ± 2.3 ng/g ww, respectively) dominated in the Baltic Sea eggs. At all three locations, longerchained perfluorinated carboxylic acids (perfluorononanoate, PFDA, PFUnA, perfluorododecanoate) increased during the monitoring period. PBDE concentrations (sum of 35 congeners) in eggs were in the ranges of 282 to 2,059 ng/g lw (Mellum), 116 to 1,722 ng/g (Trischen), and 232 to 2,021 ng/g lw (Heuwiese). Congeners associated with commercial Penta-and Octa-BDE formulations decreased during the study period. No decrease was observed for technical Deca-BDE. Conclusion: Effects of regulatory measures were apparent for PCBs and Penta-and Octa-BDE, while no consistent trend is noticeable for PFOS. © 2012 Fliedner et al.",NA,10.1186/2190-4715-24-7,Baltic Sea;seabird;environmental monitoring;PCB;Germany;Larus argentatus;North Sea;Clupeidae;pollution effect;organic acid;PBDE;Atlantic Ocean;coastal zone;hydrocarbon;PFC;Environmental Specimen Bank;Herring gull eggs;Tripneustes ventricosus;Chemical Industry;Ovum,NA,NA

The Hf.WO3 nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and characterized using XRD, TEM, EDX, and XPS to understand their structural purity and crystallinity. The prepared nanoparticles were employed to modify the base electrode by measuring voltammetric responses at Hf.WO3/CPE that was found to be more sensitive than the nascent electrode.

Maximum concentrations of historical POPs, which included PAHs (5400. ng/g), PCBs (36. ng/g) and PCNs (800. pg/g), occurred in Kempenfelt Bay, indicative of past inputs from sources in the Barrie area. This contrasted with the PFCs which had maximum sediment concentrations (2.0. ng/g perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and 1.4. ng/g perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) in the Main Basin of Lake Simcoe. The distributions of many of the chemicals included in the study were relatively uniform across Lake Simcoe outside of Kempenfelt Bay, indicating contributions by atmospheric pathways from regional air masses that cover large urban and industrial areas. This is further supported by the similarity of sediment concentrations of PBDEs and PAHs and water concentrations of PFCs between Lake Simcoe and the lower Great Lakes, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. PBDE concentrations were more variable within basins than the other compounds, and contributions from the urban Barrie area were apparent. A sediment core collected from Kempenfelt Bay showed increasing concentrations to current times for PBDEs and PFCs, while historical inputs of PCBs, PAHs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and PCNs peaked in the 1950s (PAHs) and late 1960s (chlorinated contaminants), generally consistent with usage and emissions history. © 2011.",NA,10.1016/j.jglr.2011.03.016,Persistent organic pollutants;Canada;Organic pollutants;concentration (composition);PCB;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Perfluorinated compounds;pesticide;Organic chemicals;Ontario [Canada];lake;Lakes;organic acid;organic pollutant;PBDE;Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs);Lake pollution;PAH;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;Industrial chemicals;Polychlorinated dibenzo- p - dioxins;Sediments;PCBs;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);sediment pollution;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS);sediment core;surface water;Polybrominated diphenylethers;emission;lacustrine deposit;surficial sediment;deposition;sediment analysis;air mass;Lake Simcoe;PAHs;Polychlorinated napthalenes,NA,NA

Fillets and, in selected cases, other body fractions (viscera, liver, and residual carcass) from 8 fish species were analyzed. The possibility of harmonizing the monitoring protocols was tested. Results suggest that the sampling season is not critical for PFASs and the total protein content cannot be used for normalization of tissue concentrations because PFASs bind to specific proteins. Moreover, the polar lipid content could be used to reduce the variability of PFAS concentrations in phospholipid rich fractions of fish such as viscera and carcass. The data comparison and analysis show that the PFAS contamination in lake fish is generally correlated with the degree of urbanization of the lake catchment; however, it is sometimes difficult to compare absolute concentrations in lake fish because the lake hydro-morphological characteristics play a substantial role in determining the chemical concentrations of persistent and mobile contaminants.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether there were reproductive effects or physiological responses in a model bird species, the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), associated with this extremely high exposure to PFASs. The lack of exposure above background to other contaminants at this site allowed for an assessment of PFAS effects without the complication that responses may be caused by other contaminants. A secondary objective was to determine the distribution of PFASs in multiple tissue types to better understand and interpret residues in different tissues. This can best be done at highly exposed locations where tissue concentrations would be expected to be above detectable levels if they are present in that tissue.

Aim: To evaluate the associations between POPs and thyroidal, reproductive, and adrenal hormones in a study population treated with bariatric surgery. Methods: Blood samples from a cohort of 63 participants before and 1 year after bariatric surgery were analyzed for 16 lipophilic POPs, 17 PFASs, and thyroidal, reproductive, and adrenal hormones. Participants reporting relevant medical conditions or interfering medication were excluded, and plausible confounders were corrected for in multiple regression analyses. Results: Free thyroxine (fT4) showed a significant decrease from preoperative to postoperative follow-up, and regression analyses demonstrated that p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p-DDE) was inversely associated with the ratio free triiodothyronine/free thyroxine (fT3/fT4). Testosterone concentrations in male participants increased significantly in the study period, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) increased in both gender. Regression analyses showed positive associations between increased levels of lipophilic POPs and the raised postoperative testosterone and SHBG concentrations in males. For females, an inverse association between the sum perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (ΣPFCA) and SHBG was seen. Regression analyses of postoperative serum cortisol concentrations on changes in hexachlorobenzene (HCB) showed a non-significant inverse association. Conclusion: The results suggest that POPs may have an influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes after bariatric surgery. Because of small sample sizes and discrepancy in the sampling time points pre- and postoperatively, the observed hormonal impacts of POPs must be interpreted as associative and not causative.

Due to their persistent nature, bioaccumulative potential, and significant adverse health effects associated with low concentrations, they pose a concern for human and environmental exposure. With the advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) methods, there has been an increasing number of non-targeted analysis (NTA) approaches that allow for a more comprehensive characterization of total PFAS present in environmental samples. In this study, we have developed and compared NTA workflows based on an online solid phase extraction- liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (online SPE-LC-HRMS) method followed by data processing using Compound Discoverer and FluoroMatch for the screening of PFAS in drinking waters from populated counties in South Florida, as well as in surface waters from Biscayne Bay, Key west, and Everglades canals. Tap water showed the highest number of PFAS features, indicating a poor removal of these chemicals by water treatment or perhaps the breakdown of PFAS precursors. The high number of PFAS features identified only by CD and FluoroMatch emphasizes the complementary aspects of these data processing methods. A Semi-quantitation method for NTA (qNTA) was proposed using a global calibration curve based on existing native standards and internal standards, in which concentration estimates were determined by a regression-based model and internal standard (IS) response factors. NTA play a crucial role in the identification and prioritization of non-traditionally monitored PFAS, needed for the understanding of the toxicological and environmental impact, which are largely underestimated due to the lack of such information for many PFAS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131224,Fluorocarbons;Humans;Surface waters;Article;Environmental Exposure;United States;Florida;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;chemical substance;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;Phase separation;liquid chromatography;solid phase extraction;quantitative analysis;mass spectrometry;human;drinking water;Potable water;toxicology;Water pollution;detection method;Drinking Water;High resolution mass spectrometry;environmental impact;water treatment;water supply;data processing;tap water;calibration;surface water;Water treatment;Water Pollutants;Internal standards;Chemical;Non-targeted;human impact (environment);Water Supply;Florida [United States];Screening;pollutant removal;Surface water;Data handling;Tap water;Biscayne Bay;Everglades;nontarget organism;Online SPE-LC-high-resolution mass spectrometry;Online SPE-LC-HRMS;QNTA;Quantitative estimates;South Florida;Water supply,NA,NA

However, little is known about their distribution among water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment phases in rivers, especially for the short-chain PFASs. In this work, the Yellow River, the largest turbid river in the world, was selected as a case to study eleven kinds of PFASs in the three phases of rivers. These PFASs included C4-C12 perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), perfluorobutyl sulfonate (PFBS), and perfluorooctansulfonate (PFOS), among which C4-C7 PFCAs and PFBS belong to short-chain PFASs, while C8-C12 PFCAs and PFOS belong to long-chain PFASs. The results showed that the total PFAS concentration ranged from 44.7 ng L-1 to 1.52 μg L-1 in the water, from 8.19 to 17.4 ng g-1 in the sediment, and from 3.44 to 14.7 ng g-1 in the SPM. Short-chain PFASs predominated in the water and could reach up to 88.8% of the total PFAS concentration in water, while long-chain PFASs prevailed in the sediment and SPM. The PFAS concentration in SPM showed a significant negative correlation with SPM concentration in river water (p < 0.01). The distribution coefficients (Kd) of PFASs between sediment/SPM and water increased with their chain length and there was a positive correlation between logKd and logKow (octanol-water partition coefficients). The total annual flux of all the eleven PFASs was estimated at 3.88 tons for the Yellow River into the Bohai Sea, among which the PFOA flux was the highest (0.90 tons). The widely occurrence and high concentrations of short-chain PFASs in the Yellow River indicates the shift of manufacturing focus of perfluoroalkyl chemicals from traditional long-chain ones to short-chain ones. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the eco-environmental risks of these short-chain PFASs in water environments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.221,Fluorocarbons;Rivers;Article;Carboxylation;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;China;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;environmental monitoring;chemistry;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);perfluoroalkyl substance;river water;water;Particles (particulate matter);priority journal;suspended particulate matter;Suspended particulate matters;sediment;Positive correlations;river;analysis;Negative correlation;spatial analysis;Geologic Sediments;Sediments;fresh water;Chains;partition coefficient;Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);octanol;Octanol-water partition coefficient;Fresh Water;Suspended sediments;Water Pollutants;Particulate Matter;Sediment;water quality;Chemical;particulate matter;fluvial deposit;Distribution coefficient;river ecosystem;Yellow River;perfluorinated carboxylate;Water resources;perfluorobutyl sulfonate;Annual flux;Suspended particulate matters (SPM);Turbid river;Water environments,NA,NA

Studies have indicated that exposure to POPs during pregnancy may adversely affect fetal and child development.To assess geographical differences in diet, lifestyle and environmental contaminant exposure among pregnant women in Greenland, blood samples and questionnaire data were collected from 207 pregnant women in five Greenlandic regions (North, Disco Bay, West, South and East). Blood samples were analyzed for 11 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 5 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 15 perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) and 63 metals.A trend of higher intake of marine mammals in the East and North regions was reflected by a higher n. -. 3/n. -. 6 fatty acid ratio. Participants in the East region tended also to have higher intake of terrestrial species. A significant higher seabird intake was seen for pregnant women in the West region. Significant regional differences were found for blood concentrations of PCBs, OCPs, PFASs and mercury, with higher levels in the North and East regions. PFASs were significantly associated with PCBs and OCPs in most of the regions. In the North region, PFASs were associated with both selenium and mercury. No significant regional difference was observed for PBDEs.The regional differences of blood levels of POPs and mercury were related to differences in intake of the traditional food. Compared to earlier reports, decreased levels of legacy POPs, Hg and Pb and perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were observed, but the levels of PFAS congeners perfluorohexane sulfonate and perfluorononanoic acid were sustained.

Coastal zones in highly urbanized or industrial areas are particularly vulnerable to PFOS pollution. At present, information is lacking on biomarkers to assess PFOS effects on aquatic wildlife. This study investigated the efficacy of L-carnitine (or carnitine) and fatty acids as biomarkers of PFOS exposure in aquatic biota. The levels of PFOS, total and free carnitine, and 24 fatty acids (measured as fatty acid methyl esters or FAMEs) were measured in the liver, and muscle or blubber, of fish and dolphins sampled from Galveston Bay and the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM). Overall, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) had the highest hepatic PFOS levels. Galveston Bay fish, gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), had hepatic PFOS levels ∼8-13× higher than nGoM pelagic fish species, red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). The multivariate analysis of PFOS liver body-burdens and biomarkers found carnitine to be a more modal biomarker of PFOS exposure than FAMEs. Significant positive correlation of hepatic PFOS levels with total carnitine was evident for biota from Galveston Bay (fish only), and a significant correlation between PFOS and total and free carnitine was evident for biota from the nGoM (fish and dolphins). Given the essential role of carnitine in mediating fatty acid β-oxidation, our results suggest carnitine to be a likely candidate biomarker of environmental PFOS exposure and indicative of potential dyslipidemia effects. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.cbpc.2023.109817,Fish;PFOS;Animals;Article;Fatty Acids;Carnitine;animal;nonhuman;animal experiment;comparative study;controlled study;biological marker;environmental monitoring;animal tissue;Biomarkers;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;adult;Bottle-Nosed Dolphin;bottlenose dolphin;risk assessment;biota;dietary exposure;Biota;lauric acid;oleic acid;palmitoleic acid;stearic acid;morphometry;physiology;bay;aquatic environment;body burden;fatty acid;correlation analysis;carnitine;Bays;pelagic fish;multivariate analysis;sex;Gulf of Mexico;Body-burdens;catfish;Catfishes;correlation coefficient;daleuton;Dolphins;fatty acid ester;fish consumption;Mexico,NA,NA

This study examined the effects of growth substrates and nutrients on specific intracellular and extracellular enzymes mediating 6:2 FTOH aerobic biotransformation by the white-rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Cellulolytic conditions with limited glucose were a suitable composition, resulting in high 5:3 FTCA yield (37 mol%), which is a key intermediate in 6:2 FTOH degradation without forming significant amounts of terminal perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). Sulfate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were also essential for 5:3 FTCA production, but, at lower levels, resulted in the buildup of 5:2 sFTOH (52 mol%) and 6:2 FTUCA (20 mol%), respectively. In non-ligninolytic nutrient-rich medium, 45 mol% 6:2 FTOH was transformed but produced only 12.7 mol% 5:3 FTCA. Enzyme activity studies imply that cellulolytic conditions induce the intracellular cytochrome P450 system. In contrast, extracellular peroxidase synthesis is independent of 6:2 FTOH exposure. Gene expression studies further verified that peroxidases were relevant in catalyzing the downstream transformations from 5:3 FTCA.

In this paper, detailed reactions of the main oxidant OH radicals with 4:2 FTAc in the atmosphere have been investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) calculation. All possible pathways involved in the oxidation process were presented and discussed. Based on the mechanism, transition state theory (TST) was used to predict the rate constants of the key elementary steps including the initial reactions of OH radical with n:2 FTAcs and the subsequent reactions of the main intermediates. Studies show that the reaction processes of OH radical addition to C = C bond are dominant and the fluorotelomer glyoxylate and formaldehyde are the major products. At 296 K, the calculated overall rate constant of 4:2 FTAc with OH radical is 1.19 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 with an atmospheric lifetime of 23.3 h.

The uptake constant of PFAAs increased with increasing carbon chain length, whereas the elimination coefficient displayed the opposite trend, suggesting that carbon chain length plays an important role in the bioaccumulation of PFAAs. When the contribution of suspended particulate matter was taken into account, the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) became lower (3.61–600 L/kg) compared with BAFs derived from only considering the absorption from free PFAAs in water (3.85–97000 L/kg). The results indicate that suspended particulate matter in water constitutes an important source of exposure for aquatic organisms to long-chain PFAAs. Linear (n-)PFOS was preferentially accumulated compared with branched isomers in carp. Among the branched isomers, 1m-PFOS displayed the greatest bioaccumulation, whereas m2-PFOS had the lowest. Linear PFOS displayed greater partitioning ability from blood to other tissues over branched PFOS (br-PFOS) isomers, leading to a relatively lower n-PFOS proportion in blood. In summary, suspended particulate matter made a contribution to the accumulation of long-chain PFAAs in aquatic organisms, and n-PFOS was preferentially accumulated compared with br-PFOS isomers.

Adsorption of PFCs by soil matrix was a key factor in controlling the toxicity of PFCs to soil microorganisms. The differences of carbon chain length and functional groups of PFCs have different impacts on soil microbial activity while affecting adsorption progress. Particularly, the sulfonic PFCs expressed higher toxicity than the carboxylic. It is also identified that the longer the chain length, the greater the toxicity of PFCs.

C. elegans nematodes were exposed to PFOS directly in buffer or by feeding on bacteria pretreated with PFOS, and this led to distinct gene expression profiles. Specifically, heavy metal and heat shock associated genes were significantly, although inversely, expressed following the different PFOS exposures. The innate immunity receptor for microbial pathogens, clec-60, was shown for the first time to be down-regulated by PFOS. This is in line with a previous study indicating that PFOS is associated with children's susceptibility to certain infectious diseases. Furthermore, bar-1, a gene associated with various cancers was highly up-regulated only when C. elegans were exposed to PFOS pretreated live bacteria.

Relatively great concentrations of PFOS were not only observed in products from the rapidly growing industrial areas such as Tangu District (TG) and Hangu District (HG), but also in less industrialized areas like the Dagang District (DG). The results of the hazard assessment indicated that consumption of seawater-farmed fish and market fish posed a greater hazard than wild marine fish or freshwater-farmed fish, but the risk to human health was not great.",NA,10.1080/10807039.2011.618395,China,NA,NA

In this work, animal exposure model to PFOS was established. Mass spectrometry (MS), mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and lipidomics were combined for the study of the organ targeting of PFOS, the toxicity and possible mechanism caused by PFOS. PFOS most accumulated in the liver, followed by the lungs, kidneys, spleen, heart and brain. Combined with H&E staining and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) results, it was found that the accumulation of PFOS indeed caused damage in particular areas of specific organ, like in the liver and in the marginal area of the heart. This work found that PFOS could cross the blood-brain barrier, entered the brain and caused the neurotoxicity, which was surprising and might be the reason that high dose of PFOS could cause convulsions. From the liver lipidomic analysis, we found that PFOS exposure mainly affected glycerophospholipid metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism. The up-regulated ceramide and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) might lead to liver cell apoptosis, and the decrease in liver triglyceride (TG) content might result in insufficient energy in mice and cause liver morphological damage. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis via phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway might be a mechanism of self-protection in animals against PFOS induced inflammation. This study might provide new insight into underlying toxicity mechanism after exposure to PFOS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122150,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Liver;Mice;animal;fluorocarbon;Organic pollutants;mouse;Mammals;Mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;Toxicity;liver;Metabolism;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);lipidomics;Lipidomics;phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase;Phosphatidylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase;Cell death;Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry;Glycerophospholipid metabolism;Glycerophospholipids;Liver lipidomics;Lysophosphatidylcholine;Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI);Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI);PEMT protein;PFOS toxicity;Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase;Sphingolipid metabolism;Sulfones,NA,NA

This phenomenon is puzzling because the water-bound anions of strong F-alkyl acids should be largely transported by slow oceanic currents. Herein, we investigate whether these hydrophobic F-alkyl oxoanions would behave anomalously under environmental conditions, as suggested elsewhere. Negative electrospray ionization mass spectra of micromolar aqueous PFO or PFOS solutions from pH 1.0 to 6.0 show (V) m/z = 499 (PFOS) signals that are independent of pH and (2) m/z = 413 (PFO) and 369 (PFO - CO 2) signals, plus m/z = 213 (C 3F 7CO 2 -) and 169 (C 3F 7 -) signals at higher collision energies, and, below pH ∼ 4, m/z = 827 signals from a remarkably stable (PFO) 2H - cluster that increase with decreasing pH. Since the sum of the m/z = 369, 413, and 827 signal intensities is independent of pH, that is, effectively encompasses all major species, we infer that pK a(PFOSA) < 1.0 and pK a(PFOA) < 1.0.

It has currently been identified in the environment and human bodies; nonetheless, the possible toxicities are not well-known. Zebrafish have been used as a toxicant screening model due to their fast and transparent developmental processes. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PFHxS for five days, and various experiments were performed to monitor the developmental and cellular processes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis confirmed that PFHxS was absorbed and accumulated in the zebrafish embryos. We reported that 2.5 µM or higher PFHxS exposure induced phenotypic abnormalities, marked by developmental delay in the mid-hind brain boundary and yolk sac edema. Additionally, larvae exposed to PFHxS displayed facial malformation due to the reduction of neural crest cell expression. RNA sequencing analysis further identified 4643 differentiated expressed transcripts in 5 µM PFHxS-exposed 5-days post fertilization (5-dpf) larvae. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, as well as oxidative stress were enriched in the PFHxS-exposed larvae. To validate these findings, a series of biological experiments were conducted. PFHxS exposure led to a nearly 4-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, possibly due to hyperglycemia and impaired glutathione balance. The Oil Red O’ staining and qPCR analysis strengthens the notions that lipid metabolism was disrupted, leading to lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and malondialdehyde formation. All these alterations ultimately affected cell cycle events, resulting in S and G2/M cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that PFHxS could accumulate and induce various developmental toxicities in aquatic life, and such data might assist the government to accelerate the regulatory policy on PFHxS usage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131722,PFAS;Fluorocarbons;Humans;chemical pollutant;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Sulfonic Acids;Oxidative Stress;Cells;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;chemistry;lipid;lipid metabolism;water pollutant;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;oxidative stress;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;sulfonic acid derivative;toxicity;Toxicity;Cytology;developmental toxicity;embryo;environmental fate;Environmental pollutants;human;Exposed to;metabolism;animal model;mRNA expression level;zebra fish;protein expression;real time polymerase chain reaction;glutathione;organic acid;Zebrafish;Metabolism;nonmammalian embryo;cyprinid;lipid peroxidation;bioinformatics;phenotype;malonaldehyde;Polymerase chain reaction;Developmental toxicity;Oxidative stress;reactive oxygen metabolite;Reactive Oxygen Species;lipid storage;Embryo;Lipid metabolisms;Shorter chains;Water Pollutants;fertilization;mesencephalon;yolk sac;neural crest cell;Chemical;cell;glucose metabolism;hyperglycemia;larva;Larva;cell cycle arrest;RNA sequencing;Zebrafish embryos;Nonmammalian;Cell cycle;craniofacial development;craniofacial malformation;developmental delay;edema;Embryogenesis;Environmental pollutant;face malformation;G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint;in situ hybridization;protein expression level;rhombencephalon;S phase cell cycle checkpoint,NA,NA

Consequently, the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires a monitoring of certain priority substances such as mercury, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and its derivatives (PFOS), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDD) and polychlorinated dioxins/dioxin-like compounds (dioxins) in freshwater and coastal fish. Tissue levels have to comply with biota environmental quality standards (EQSs) given in Directive 2013/39/EU. EQSs are justified either by risks for human health (assessed on the basis of fillet) or secondary poisoning of wildlife (based on whole fish). To support the practical implementation of the WFD biota monitoring in Germany, comparative investigations of target fish species caught at six sites were performed. Results At each site, at least three fish species listed in a national guidance document were sampled (e.g., chub, roach, bream, perch). Beside biometric data, concentrations of seven priority substances were determined in pooled fillet and carcass samples and whole fish data were calculated. The EQSs for PBDE and mercury were exceeded in nearly all fillet and whole fish samples. PFOS was above the EQS at several sites especially in perch, while HCB exceeded the EQS only at one site (Elbe River). All fillet and whole fish samples complied with the EQSs for dioxins and HBCDD. Based on wet weight concentrations of a homogeneous set of 20 composite sample pairs of 3-5 year-old fish, the following fillet-to-whole fish conversion factors were derived: mercury 0.81, PBDE 5.4, HCB 3.6, PFOS 2.7, dioxins 5.3, and HBCDD 1.8. Conclusions Recommendations on selection of target fish species, age or tissue given by EU and national guidance documents are practical and feasible. However, further adjustments of the samplings such as the determination of site-specific length-age relationships are required from both ecological and risk assessment perspectives. The derived conversion factors allow the translation of fillet-to-whole fish concentrations (and vice versa), and thus the EQS compliance assessment for the appropriate tissue (fillet for human health, whole fish for wildlife risks) if only one tissue is investigated.",NA,10.1186/s12302-020-0295-9,character(0),NA,NA

The properties of perfluoroalkylated compounds that cause them to persist in the environment are also the properties that made them attractive compounds for industrial usage for over 50 years. Due to the unique properties of the carbon-fluorine bond and the polarity of perfluoroalkyl groups, potential substitutes to replace perfluorinated surfactants in most cases continue to be perfluoroalkyl based. Thus, issues of persistence in the environment remain. There is a need to test emerging new substitute surfactants for biodegradability. This study involved degradability measurements of emerging perfluorinated surfactant substitutes. The stability of the substitutes of perfluorinated surfactants was tested by employing advanced oxidation processes, which were based on degradation by ultraviolet lamp, hydrogen peroxide, or both, followed by conventional tests, among them an automated method based on the manometric respirometry test (OECD 301 F; OxiTop), closed-bottle test (OECD 301 D), and standardized fixed-bed bioreactor on perfluorobutane sulfonate, fluorosurfactant Zonyl, two fluoraliphatic esters (NOVEC FC-4430 and NOVEC FC-4432), and 10-(trifluoromethoxy) decane 1 sulfonate.

In this study, time trends, 1971–2001, of bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulfone (BCPS) and of methylsulfonyl-substituted metabolites of PCBs and 4,4′-DDE, were investigated in eggs of guillemot (Uria aalge) hatching in the Baltic Proper. Temporal trends of PCBs, trans-nonachlor, β-HCH, 4,4′-DDT, and 4,4′-DDE were also assessed. Tris(4-chlorophenyl) methane (TCPMe), a 4,4′-DDT by-product, was detected in the eggs. The concentration of BCPS ranged between 2.6–0.76μg/g on a lipid weight basis over the three decades and showed a significant 1.6% annual decrease. Three metabolites of PCBs, i.e. 3′-MeSO<sub>2</sub>-CB101, 4′-MeSO<sub>2</sub>-CB101 and 4-MeSO<sub>2</sub>-CB149, were quantified in all samples over time and showed an annual decrease of approximately 3% compared to MeSO<sub>2</sub>-DDE with a decrease of 8.9%. The methylsulfonyl-PCB and -DDE metabolites are eliminated more slowly than the persistent PCB congeners and 4,4′-DDE. Trans-nonachlor decreases by 16% compared to 19% and 9% for 4,4′-DDT and β-HCH, respectively. The concentration of TCPMe in guillemot decreased by 8.2% per year. A linear relationship was found between TCPMe and 4,4′-DDE concentrations which supports the theory that TCPMe has an origin as a contaminant in commercial 4,4′-DDT products. The very slow decrease in BCPS concentrations is notable and remains to be explained. BCPS is still present at rather high concentrations in the guillemot eggs. The enantiomeric fraction varied between 0.27 and 0.67 which indicates less of a specific retention of the chiral MeSO<sub>2</sub>-PCBs in guillemot eggs than in grey seal tissues, for example.

A total of 4,881 samples collected in previous years (2000 – 2009) in seven Member States was considered for a detailed data analysis. Data were reported on different sets of 17 PFASs resulting in 24,204 single observations. Overall, only 11.8 % of the results were quantifiable results. Perfluorooctane sulfonate was the most frequent compound (31 %). Across food groups, PFASs were mostly found in ‘Fish offal’ (68 %), ‘Edible offal, game animals’ (64%), ‘Meat, game mammals’ (22 %), ‘Water molluscs’ (20 %), ‘Crustaceans’ (17 %) and ‘Fish meat’ (9.7 %). The highest contamination both in terms of frequency and mean level was found in meat and edible offal of game animals, fish and seafood, whereas meat and edible offal of farmed animals resulted less contaminated. To ensure an accurate assessment of the presence of PFASs in food and beverages, further improvement of the analytical methods, sampling and data reporting are recommended. © 2011 European Food Safety Authority",NA,10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2016,PFAS;PFOS;food;PFOA;Perfluoroalkylated substances;occurrence,NA,NA

The bioaccumulation factors of PFASs by D. magna decreased linearly with the increase of Ca2+ and Na+ concentrations. The inhibition effect of Ca2+ was stronger than that of Na+, and the decreasing percentages of the body burden of PFASs in D. magna caused by the increment of 1mmolL-1 Ca2+ and 1mmolL-1 Na+ were 41% to approximately 48% and 2% to approximately 5%, respectively, in the presence of soy peptone. The partition coefficients (Kp) of PFASs between protein and water increased with rising Ca2+ and Na+ concentrations. The elevated Kp values led to the reduced concentrations of freely dissolved PFASs. This resulted in a decrease of PFAS bioaccumulation in D. magna, and the body burden of each PFAS was positively correlated with its freely dissolved concentration in water. The present study suggests that cations should be considered in the assessment of bioavailability and risk of PFASs in natural waters containing proteinaceous compounds. © 2014 SETAC.",NA,10.1002/etc.2823,Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Bioaccumulation;Cattle;Bovine;Serum Albumin;Protein;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;comparative study;controlled study;bioaccumulation;bioavailability;protein;Mammals;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;quality control;concentration (composition);liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;Risk assessment;organofluorine derivative;priority journal;bovine;perfluorononanoic acid;Perfluorononanoic acids;metabolism;ion;Ions;calcium;Calcium;organic acid;body burden;risk factor;Proteins;drug effects;Positive ions;Bioavailability;Daphnia;Daphnia magna;Dissolved organic matter (DOM);Dissolved organic matters;peptone;Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);sodium;Dissolution;Sodium;Bovinae;bovine serum albumin;static electricity;inhibition;Bioaccumulation factor;rainbow trout;crustacean;Freely dissolved concentration;Soybean Proteins;calcium ion;Cations;Lumbriculus variegatus;dissolved organic carbon;Perna viridis;soy peptone;soybean protein,NA,NA

In this review article, the safety, regulatory, and remediation aspects of POPs including aromatic, chlorinated, pesticides, brominated, and fluorinated compounds, are discussed. Industrial and agricultural activities are identified as the main sources of these harmful chemicals, which are released to air, soil and water, impacting on social and economic development of society at a global scale. The main types of POPs are presented, illustrating their effects on wildlife and human beings, as well as the ways in which they contaminate the food chain. Some of the most promising and innovative technologies developed for the removal of POPs from water are discussed, contrasting their advantages and disadvantages with those of more conventional treatment processes. The promising methods presented in this work include bioremediation, advanced oxidation, ionizing radiation, and nanotechnology. Finally, some alternatives to define more efficient approaches to overcome the impacts that POPs cause in the hydric sources are pointed out.

The process of salting-out has been observed for PFOS in surface estuaries and likely operates in ‘subterranean estuaries’, where tide-induced groundwater circulation creates a dynamic saltwater-freshwater mixing zone in the aquifer adjacent to the ocean. The presence of this dynamic interface between dense seawater and fresh groundwater modifies the flow path of land-derived organic contaminants. However, it is unclear how SOE combined with tidal forcing of salt water, affects the transport and fate of these contaminants in a subterranean estuary. Numerical studies of groundwater dynamics in a coastal aquifer are carried out using a modified version of SUTRA to investigate the behavior of PFOS, as it moves through an aquifer-ocean interface. Three adsorption scenarios are investigated: no adsorption and linear adsorption with a constant coefficient (Kd) and a salinity-dependent Kd (due to SOE). Without adsorption, point-injected PFOS moves and spreads as a plume around the margin of the tide-induced upper saline plume (USP). This is in agreement with previous studies showing that a contaminant plume follows the freshwater discharge path and exits the aquifer around the USP in the intertidal zone. The increase of tidal amplitude enlarges the USP, forcing the discharge points of freshwater and PFOS seaward. In the case of a constant Kd, PFOS concentration decreases in the groundwater as expected with an increase of PFOS residence time in the aquifer. The spatial distribution of the contaminant plume is similar to that of the ‘no adsorption’ case. In the case with the SOE, which enhances the solute adsorption in the saltwater zone, PFOS tends to be intercepted by the USP, concentrated at its center, and subsequently discharged with the tide-induced saltwater circulation. SOE reduces both peak PFOS discharge rate and plume dispersion. In addition, the PFOS flow path moves upward and the PFOS discharges above the USP. The findings highlight the potential importance of investigating the SOE of organic contaminants for benthic organisms when considering their transport and fate in tidally influenced coastal aquifers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104240,Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Adsorption;persistent organic pollutant;adsorption;environmental fate;Contamination;Estuaries;Groundwater pollution;Seawater;Impurities;Aquifers;Groundwater resources;pollutant transport;coastal aquifer;Coastal aquifers;Freshwater-saltwater interaction;Freshwater/saltwater;Hydro-environment;Hydrochemistry;Hydrogeochemical process;hydrogeochemistry;Mixing;Perfluorooctane sulphonate transport;PFOS transport;Residence time distribution;salt water;Salt water intrusion;Salting out;Salting out effects;Salting-out effect;Subterranean estuary;tide;Sulfones,NA,NA

Perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) was the most prevalent PFAS in surface water, followed by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), accounted for 42.62 %, 22.23 % and 17.72 % of the total concentrations of the PFASs analyzed, respectively. PFBA was dominant in sediments, accounting for 60.37 % of the total concentrations of the PFASs analyzed. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the main pollutant in biota, and the highest concentration (5.09 ng/g) was found in Channa argus. Considering the measured concentrations in water, sediments and biota, the sediment-water partition coefficients (log Kd) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of PFASs were determined. The log Kd of the PFASs differed among those with a different carbon chain length, C7-C11 PFASs were more likely to be adsorbed onto sediments as the carbon chain length increases, and PFUnDA and PFDA showed the higher BAF value in Channa argus. PFASs in the Huai River Basin posed an acceptable ecological risk, and long-chain PFAS contamination provided green algae with a higher potential ecological risk.

In this work, the combustion efficiencies of 13 different PFASs were determined (66–110%). A notable difference was observed between calibrating the CIC with inorganic fluorine or organofluorine. Potential interferences from cations and coextracted matrix components from whole blood and surface water samples were evaluated.

In current-clamp experiments, PFOS significantly decreased the action potential frequency during current injection, the maximum rate of fall and the threshold of action potential, and negatively shifted the resting membrane potential at doses over 30 μM. In voltage-clamp experiments, PFOS shifted the half-activation and inactivation voltages of ICa, INa, and IK toward hyperpolarization at 30 μM. IHCN1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes was similarly affected. Incorporation of PFOS into the cell membrane probably increased the surface negative charge density, thereby reducing the transmembrane potential gradient and resulting in hyperpolarizing shifts of both the activation and inactivation of ionic channels.

At such sites, often persistent perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and so-called precursors, which can be transformed into PFAAs, co-occur. In this study, the release of PFAAs from 14 soil samples from an agricultural site in southwest Germany contaminated via compost/paper sludge was investigated. Rapid leaching of C4-C8 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) was observed in saturated column tests, while slowing down with increasing chain-length (≥ C9 PFCAs). Two selected samples were further incubated in batch-tests after removal of existing C4-C8 PFCAs in extensive column leaching tests until a liquid-solid ratio of 10 l/kg. During 60 days of incubation, aqueous concentrations of C4-C8 PFCAs increased linearly by a factor of 29–222, indicating continuous production by transformation of precursors. The potential PFAA-precursor reservoir was estimated by the direct total oxidizable precursor (dTOP) assay. PFCA concentrations after the dTOP increased up to two orders of magnitude.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are ubiquitous in rural and urban soils. In this study, we assessed the effects of PFOS on a spontaneous plant, velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), using endpoints such as plant growth, stress defense, PFOS uptake, and elemental and metabolite profile. We observed stunted growth in plants grown in PFOS-contaminated soils, with PFOS accumulating in their shoots by up to 3000 times more than the control plants. The other endpoints (decreased chlorophyll a synthesis, elevated oxidative stress, reduced shoot Mg concentration, and reduced biomass production) also explained the stunted growth of velvetleaf exposed to elevated PFOS concentrations. We found that 56 metabolites involved in 13 metabolic pathways were dysregulated. The synthesis of important antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, hydroxycinnamic acids (coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids), and tocopherols decreased, resulting in loss of plant's defense to stress. PFOS also reduced the levels of growth-related and stress-coping metabolites including squalene, serotonin, noradrenalin, putrescine, and indole-3-propionic acid, which further corroborated the restricted growth of velvetleaf exposed to elevated PFOS.

Uptake of PFAAs by earthworms (Eisenia fetida) exposed to unspiked soils with varying levels of PFAAs (a control soil, an industrially impacted biosolids-amended soil, a municipal biosolidsamended soil, and two AFFF-impacted soils) was measured. Standard 28 day exposure experiments were conducted in each soil, and measurements taken at additional time points in the municipal soil were used to model the kinetics of uptake. Uptake and elimination rates and modeling suggested that steady state bioaccumulation was reached within 28 days of exposure for all PFAAs. The highest concentrations in the earthworms were for per fluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in the AFFF-impacted Soil A (2160 ng/g) and perfluorododecanoate (PFDoA) in the industrially impacted soil (737 ng/g). Wet-weight (ww) and organic carbon (OC)-based biota soil accumulation factors (BSAFs) for the earthworms were calculated after 28 days of exposure for all five soils. The highest BSAF in the industrially impacted soil was for PFDoA (0.42 goc/gww,worm). Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs, dry-weight-basis, dw) were also calculated at 28 days for each of the soils. With the exception of the control soil and perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) in the industrially impacted soil, all BAF values were above unity, with the highest being for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) in the AFFF-impacted Soil A (139 gdw,soil/ gdw,worm). BSAFs and BAFs increased with increasing chain length for the perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) and decreased with increasing chain length for the perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs). The results indicate that PFAA bioaccumulation into earthworms depends on soil concentrations, soil characteristics, analyte, and duration of exposure, and that accumulation into earthworms may be a potential route of entry of PFAAs into terrestrial foodwebs.

PFAS concentrations in stock water were stable for more than a year, they were non-measurable in grass but present at very low levels in soil which equated to just 1% of the intake from water. Prior to quantifying PFAS in cattle serum there had been no breeding for 18 months. Although there were high concentrations of several PFAS in the water, only perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulphonate (PFHxS) were in cattle serum in appreciable amounts; perfluoroheptane sulphonate (PFHpS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were much lower. Transfer factors (TFs) for cattle were calculated by dividing steady state serum concentration (ng PFAS/mL) by water concentration (µg PFAS/L). Average and upper estimate TF values for cattle were calculated; the former were 140 (total PFOS, i.e. tPFOS), 130 (PFHpS), 65 (PFHxS), 170 (PFNA), and 120 (PFDA). Previous investigation campaigns at the farm provided relative steady state serum PFAS concentrations for sheep and cattle that allowed adjustment of the cattle TFs. The resulting average estimate TFs for ewes (non-pregnant and not lactating) were 20 (tPFOS) and 30 (PFHxS), other PFAS were not measurable in sheep serum. Discussion on using these TFs in human health risk assessments is provided. With certain assumptions/caveats the TFs allow estimations of PFAS steady state serum concentrations for use in preliminary human health risk assessments (HHRAs) when only PFAS in stock water is known. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,10.1080/19440049.2021.1942562,PFAS;Fluorocarbons;Agriculture;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Cattle;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;chemistry;Health risks;perfluoroalkanoic acid;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;adult;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;Risk assessment;sulfonic acid derivative;blood level;soil;water;bovine;blood;sheep;Sheep;water contamination;perfluorononanoic acid;Perfluorononanoic acids;metabolism;Australia;half life time;Water concentrations;veterinary medicine;Risk perception;grass;Perfluorooctanesulphonate;agricultural land;Farms;Water;steady state;Water Pollutants;Human health risk assessment;cattle;Monitoring;Chemical;Serum concentration;ingestion;health risk assessment;beef cattle;cattle farming;ewe;Perfluoroheptane;perfluoroheptane sulphonate;Physiologic;physiologic monitoring;sheep farming;stockwater;transfer factor;Transfer Factor,NA,NA

Toxic pollutants including volatile organic compounds (VOC), volatile organohalogen compounds (VOX), chlorophenols, phenoxyacids, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in seawater from the Gulf of Gdansk coastal waters in the period 1996-2001. In the case of the Gulf of Gdansk, non-conservative behaviour of VOC was observed due to random temporal and spatial of inputs along the Vistula estuary and to the dilution of VOC-enriched river water with seawater. The concentrations of VOX in seawater decreased throughout the period and the concentrations of VOX were in the range of few ng dm(-3) up to 250 ng dm(-3), similar to estuaries elsewhere. The average concentrations of chlorophenols and phenoxyacids were between 0.1 and 6.0 and 0.05 and 2.2 mug dm(-3), respectively. However, remarkably high concentrations of 2,4-dichlorophenol (6 mug dm(-3)) were obtained in samples collected from the Vistula River. Generally concentrations of PCBs did not exceed few ng dm(-3) with the exception of 1999, when all samples exhibited elevated concentrations of PCBs. In addition, higher concentrations of PCBs in the open sea compared to river waters suggested localised inputs. Due to the ability of most organic pollutants to bioaccumulate and biomagnify, especially the persistent organic pollutants, continued monitoring is of crucial importance for the health of marine life in the Gulf of Gdansk.

We analyzed 14 PFCs (seven were detected in more than 75% of samples), 10 PBDEs (only BDE 47 was detected), and 27 OCs, including 12 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners (14 OCs were detected). Median total PFC concentration was higher than median total OC concentration (43 vs 39 ng/g wet wt).

No covariability was found between protein-bound and lipid-soluble compounds; individuals with high concentrations of PFCs did not have high concentrations of OCs or BDE 47. The concentrations of PFCs were lower in birds caught during the late sampling period compared to those of the early period, and females had lower levels of some PFCs compared with males, suggesting that females sequester fluorinated substances into eggs. For lipid-soluble compounds, no significant sex or sampling period differences were found, except that trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor, and p,p′-DDE concentrations were lower in birds caught during the late sampling period. The pattern of PFC compounds (relative to PFOS) and lipid-soluble compounds (relative to PCB 153) differed between sampling periods in females but not in males.

The unique physiochemi-cal properties of PFAS and their complex interactions with environmental matrices create a great challenge for researchers when selecting site-specific sample matrices, sampling logistics, various analytical methods, and data interpretation. The widespread contamination and the potential toxicity of PFAS to human and environmental health have resulted in the proposed designation of two commonly used PFAS as hazardous substances, which may prompt new requirements for reporting, regulatory action, and site cleanup. For researchers involved in natural resource damage assessment efforts, understanding the multifaceted dynamics of the environmental fate and transport of PFAS will be essential for appropriate sample collections, analyses, and data interpretation.

Scenedesmus obliquus was exposed to CI-PFESA at ng L-1 to mg L-1, with the exposure regime beginning at the environmentally relevant level. The total log BAF of CI-PFESA in S. obliquus was 4.66, higher than the reported log BAF of PFOS in the freshwater plankton (2.2-3.2). CI-PFESA adsorbed to the cell surface accounted for 33.5-68.3% of the total concentrations. The IC50 of CI-PFESA to algal growth was estimated to be 40.3 mg L-1. Significant changes in algal growth rate and chlorophyll a/b contents were observed at 11.6 mg L-1 and 13.4 mg L-1 of CI-PFESA, respectively. The sample cell membrane permeability, measured by the fluorescein diacetate hydrolyzation, was increased by CI-PFESA at 5.42 mg L-1. The mitochondrial membrane potential, measured by Rh123 staining, was also increased, indicating the hyperpolarization induced by CI-PFESA. The increasing ROS and MDA contents, along with the enhanced SOD, CAT activity, and GSH contents, suggested that CI-PFESA caused oxidative damage in the algal cells. It is less possible that current CI-PFESA pollution in surface water posed obvious toxic effects on the green algae. However, the bioaccumulation of CI-PFESA in algae would contribute to its biomagnification in the aquatic food chain and its effects on membrane property could potentially increase the accessibility and toxicity of other coexisting pollutants.

PFAS are synthesized by two processes, direct fluorination (e.g., electrochemical fluorination) and oligomerization (e.g., fluorotelomerization). More than a megatonne of PFAS is produced yearly, and thousands of PFAS wind up in end-use products. Atmospheric and aqueous fugitive releases during manufacturing, use, and disposal have resulted in the global distribution of these compounds. Volatile PFAS facilitate long-range transport, commonly followed by complex transformation schemes to recalcitrant terminal PFAS, which do not degrade under environmental conditions and thus migrate through the environment and accumulate in biota through multiple pathways.

The prediction errors were <1 log unit when literature descriptors were used, and the errors were reduced to <0.2 log units on average by further optimization of the descriptors.

rayyan-735664990,A review on current knowledge and future prospects of organohalogen contaminants (OHCs) in Asian birds.,2016,1,26,Science of the Total Environment,0048-9697,542,NA,411-426,NA,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=6d4efe2c-2fd1-309c-a8b6-439ef8cf6678,eng,NA,NA,"The release of harmful chemicals in the Asian environment has recently increased dramatically due to rising industrial and agricultural activities. About 60% of the global human population is currently living on the Asian continent and may thus be exposed to a large range of different chemicals. Different classes of organohalogen chemicals have indeed been reported in various environmental compartments from Asia including humans and wildlife, but this issue has received less attention in birds. In this article, we reviewed the available literature on levels of legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and various flame retardants (FRs) in Asian avifauna to analyze the existing pool of knowledge as well as to identify the gaps that should be addressed in future research. Furthermore, we discussed the variation in levels of organohalogens based on differences in regions, trophic level, dietary sources and migratory behaviors of species including distribution patterns in different tissues of birds. Although the mass of published literature is very low and even absent in many important regions of Asia, we deduced from the reported studies that levels of almost all classes of organohalogens (OHCs) including FRs were highest in East Asian countries such as Japan, China and South Korea, except for HCHs that were found at maximum levels in birds of South India. Concentrations (ng/g LW) of different OHCs in Asian birds ranged between &lt; LOD (limit of detection) to 14,000,000 for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), &lt; LOD to 790,000 for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), &lt; LOD to 12,000 for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), &lt; LOD to 29,000 for hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), &lt; LOD to 47,000 for chlordanes (CHLs) and &lt; LOD to 4600 for total cyclodienes. Further, ranges (ng/g LW) of 1.1 to 150,000 for Co-PCBs; &lt; LOD to 27 for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs); &lt; LOD to 45 for polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and 0.02 to 73 for PCDD/DFs have been reported in Asian aves. Among emerging FRs, levels of total polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), total dechlorane plus (DPs) [ syn and anti DPs] and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDs) oscillated between &lt; LOD to 134,000, &lt; LOD to 3820 [&lt; 0.1–920 and &lt; 0.1–2900], and &lt; LOD to 11,800 ng/g LW, respectively. Corresponding ranges of novel brominated flame retardants (nBFRs) such as decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) were &lt; LOD to 820 and &lt; LOD to 89 ng/g LW. Other nBFRs such as tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) hexabromobenzene (HBB) and pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) in Asian avifauna have been reported in very few studies. Dependence of organohalogens on dietary sources and subsequent biomagnification in the food chain has been corroborated through δ 15 N and δ 13 C stable isotope proxies. In general, tissues with higher fat content accumulated more organohalogens and vice versa. Aspects such as maternal transfer of OHCs and temporal trends have rarely been discussed in reported literature from Asia. The mobility of birds, vicinity to sources and trans-boundary movement of pollutants were identified as key exposure routes and subsequent OHCs contamination in Asian birds. There is extreme scarcity of literature on organohalogen contamination in birds from Northern, South-eastern and west Asian countries where an industrial boom has been witnessed in the past few decades. Current scenarios suggest that levels of OHCs, particularly the FRs, are rising in birds of Asia and it would be wise to develop baseline information and to regulate the OHCs emission accordingly.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.088,Organohalogen compounds;Environmental exposure;Environmental chemistry;Persistent pollutants;Fireproofing agents;Environmental aspects;Toxicological chemistry;Asian Continental Ancestry Group,NA,NA

A total of 210 POPs were detected and/or quantifiable with some frequency in all fat or liver samples. POP profile and concentration differences were investigated both within (e.g. age and sex) and between the two subpopulations. Two time-point comparisons were made relative to POPs reported for Hudson Bay polar bears harvested in 2007-2008. Sigma Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations at both time points were the most concentrated of the POP groups, and were spatially uniform with no detectable influence of sex or age, as were concentrations of the dominant congener CB153. Sigma Chlordanes (Sigma CHLs, 74-79% oxychlordane) and the Sigma perfluoroalkyl substances (Sigma PFASs, approximate to 60% perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)) had the second greatest POP group concentrations in SHB and WHB respectively, with SPFASs and SCHLs being significantly influenced by age and/or sex. SCHLs were spatially uniform but SPFASs were greater in the SHB bears, as were e.g. some flame retardants, due to e.g. local contamination and/or changes in bear behavior and diet. Endosulfans and hexabromocyclododecane were detectable in samples from 2007-2008 but not from 2013-2014, which is consistent with their global POP regulations. SPolychlorinated naphthalenes (Sigma PCNs) were consistently detected at relatively high concentrations compared to other arctic wildlife, however these concentrations were low relative to legacy POPs. Sigma Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (Sigma SCCPs) were major contributors to the overall POPs burden with concentrations comparable to other legacy POPs, though there was no significant difference between or within subpopulations for PCNs or SCCPs. Except for octachlorostyrene, POPs concentrations were generally lower in female and male bears from SHB in 2013-2014 relative to 2007-2008, however those of WHB males were greater over the same timeframe for almost all POPs.

As one of the most used anthropogenic PFCs, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been received much attention in recent years. It is a new kind of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which have been found to be accumulated and biomagnified ubiquitously through food chain all over the world. PFOS poses serious risks to the health of many aquatic organisms and the safety of aquatic ecosystem. The potential toxicity of PFOS is of increasingly ecological concern. In the present study, the ecotoxicological effects of PFOS exposure on embryo and larva of zabrafish Danio rerio were examined to evaluate the possible hazard of this pollutant to development and behavior of fish and to pursue a potential biomarker of PFOS contamination. Embryos of zebrafish were exposed to 0, 0. 1, 1 and 10 mg/L PFOS in 4 hour-post-fertilization (hpf). Mortality, deformation rate, heart rate, locomotor performance and growth of zebrafish larvae, and hatching rate of zebrafish embryos were investigated. Proportion of motile individual, motion distance, pause frequency, average distance of each movement and maximum distance of continuous locomotion were used to quantify the locomotor performance of zebrafish larvae. PFOS exposure showed remarkable effects on hatching rate, mortality and deformation rate of zebrafish (P < 0.05). Hatching delayed and cumulative hatching rate decreased significantly after the embryos were exposed to 10 mg/L PFOS (P < 0. 05). The cumulative mortality and deformation rate of zebrafish larvae at 6 day-post-fertilization (dpf) upon exposure to 10 mg/L PFOS increased significantly (P < 0.05). Heart rate of zebrafish larvae at 4 dpf and 8 dpf was significantly affected by PFOS exposure (P < 0.05) and increased with enhanced PFOS concentration. PFOS exposure imposed marked influence on locomotor performance of zebrafish larvae at 6 dpf and 9 dpf (P < 0.05). Maximum distance of continuous locomotion and proportion of motile zebrafish larvae at 6 dpf increased significantly after exposed to 10 mg/L PFOS (P < 0.05). PFOS affected the locomotor performance of zebrafish larvae at 9 dpf in a dose-dependent way. Motion distance, pause frequency, and average distance of each movement decreased with the increase of PFOS concentration, whereas maximum distance of continuous locomotion increased with enhanced concentration of PFOS. Additionally, significant decrease or a decreasing trend in growth (body length) and mouth width at 6 dpf and 9 dpf was observed in PFOS exposure groups. Mouth width: body length ratio and mouth width: head length ratio of zebrafish larvae were dramatically affected by PFOS exposure (P <0.05). The overall results indicated that PFOS imposed clearly developmental and behavioral toxicity on zebrafish embryos and larva. The heart rate, locomotor performance, mouth width: body length ratio and mouth width: head length ratio of zebrafish larvae might be used as an integrative biomarker or indicator of aquatic environmental PFOS contamination.",NA,10.5846/stxb201207291073,PFOS;bioaccumulation;biomarker;bioindicator;pollution exposure;hatching;mortality;ecotoxicology;growth rate;anthropogenic source;food chain;toxicity test;organic pollutant;Zebrafish;cyprinid;abnormality;fluorine;locomotion;larva;Larva;body size;Growth;Locomotor performance,NA,NA

Zinc was the only element concentration of which successively reduced across coastal-open ocean gradient. Considering own and literary data, we can assume that the cross-shelf decrease of zinc accumulation in zooplankton is a universal pattern, manifested in different climatic and biogeochemical environmental conditions and with different species compositions of the zooplankton community. Cross-shelf changes were also established for Li, As, and U. However, the concentrations of these elements increased along the gradient. We assume that increased As concentration in zooplankton across the shelf-continental slope gradient of the Laptev Sea is associated with a change in the feeding behavior ofthe species of the zooplankton community. However, a sharp increase in the concentrations of Li and U in zooplankton was associated with the appearance of Calanus copepods in the community. The average total concentration of rare-earth elements and yttrium in zooplankton of the Laptev Sea was 752.8ngg(-1) of dry weight.

The humic substances included humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA), the protein compounds included chicken egg albumin (albumin) and peptone, and the PFASs included perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, and perfluorododecanoic acid. Four concentrations (0, 1, 10, and 20mgL-1) of the four dissolved organic matter (DOM) types were investigated. At the 1mgL-1 level, HA and albumin enhanced all tested PFAS bioaccumulation, whereas FA and peptone only enhanced the bioaccumulation of shorter-chain PFASs (PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA). However, all four DOM types decreased all tested PFAS bioaccumulation at the 20mgL-1 level, and the decreasing ratios of bioaccumulation factors caused by FA, HA, albumin, and peptone were 1-49%, 23-77%, 17-58%, and 8-56%, respectively compared with those without DOM. This is because DOM not only reduced the bioavailable concentrations and uptake rates of PFASs but also lowered the elimination rates of PFASs in D. magna, and these opposite effects would change with different DOM types and concentrations. Although the partition coefficients (Lkg-1) of PFASs between HA and water (104.21-104.98) were much lower than those between albumin and water (104.92-105.86), their effects on PFAS bioaccumulation were comparable.

The present critical review focuses on the fate and adverse effects of PFASs in the aquatic environment. The PFASs are continuously emitted into the environment from point and nonpoint sources such as sewage treatment plants and atmospheric deposition, respectively. Although concentrations of single substances may be too low to cause adverse effects, their mixtures can be of significant environmental concern. The production of C8-based PFASs (i.e., perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS] and perfluorooctanoate [PFOA]) is largely phased out; however, the emissions of other PFASs, in particular short-chain PFASs and PFAS precursors, are increasing. The PFAS precursors can finally degrade to persistent degradation products, which are, in particular, perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs). In the environment, PFSAs and PFCAs are subject to partitioning processes, whereby short-chain PFSAs and PFCAs are mainly distributed in the water phase, whereas long-chain PFSAs and PFCAs tend to bind to particles and have a substantial bioaccumulation potential. However, there are fundamental knowledge gaps about the interactive toxicity of PFAS precursors and their persistent degradation products but also interactions with other natural and anthropogenic stressors. Moreover, because of the continuous emission of PFASs, further information about their ecotoxicological potential among multiple generations, species interactions, and mixture toxicity seems fundamental to reliably assess the risks for PFASs to affect ecosystem structure and function in the aquatic environment. © 2014 SETAC.",NA,10.1002/etc.2663,"Biochemistry;Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS);Ecotoxicology;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Carboxylation;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Ecosystems;nonhuman;unclassified drug;Mixtures;ecotoxicity;bioaccumulation;binding affinity;hydrophobicity;organophosphate;Degradation;oxidative stress;perfluoroalkyl substance;water pollution;gene expression;chronic toxicity;Risk assessment;sulfonic acid derivative;Toxicity;organic matter;article;carboxylic acid derivative;ecotoxicology;polyfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;food web;water contamination;atmospheric transport;pollution effect;fatty acid binding protein;zebra fish;Caprylates;biotransformation;aquatic environment;organic compound;literature review;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid derivative;acute toxicity;environmental impact;biodegradation;albumin;concentration (parameters);physical chemistry;atmospheric deposition;Meteorological problems;industrial waste;adverse outcome;industrial toxic substance;Chains;fluorine derivative;phosphonic acid derivative;Water Pollutants;aquatic community;Effects;invertebrate;alcohol derivative;Chemical;Aquatic environments;biosolid;Sewage treatment plants;runoff;sewage treatment;acetic acid derivative;aldehyde derivative;Aquatic environment;emission;Fate;green alga;leaf litter;Multiple stressors;n:2 fluorotelomer alcohol derivative;n:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid derivative;n:2 fluorotelomer saturated aldehyde derivative;n:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated aldehyde derivative;n:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid derivative;nonpoint source pollution;perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acid derivative;perfluoroalkyl sulfonamidoacetic acid derivative;perfluoroalkyl sulfonamidoethanol derivative;Photobacterium phosphoreum;polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid ester derivative;sewage treatment plant;Species interaction;Species interactions;x:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid derivative;perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);Polyfluoroalkyl;RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly I-C;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Polymethyl Methacrylate",NA,NA

[Objective] This study aims to analyze the pollution status of PFAS in drinking water in Shanghai and assess relevant human health risk. [Methods] Source water samples were collected from two water sources (A and B) in Shanghai, including the Yangtze estuary water source and the Huangpu River upstream water source. According to water production process, treated water samples were collected from one routine treatment water plant and one deep treatment water plant which both used water source A, as well as from one deep treatment water plant which used water source B. Samples were collected in October 2019 (level period), December 2019 (dry period), and July 2020 (wet period) respectively, with 2 parallel samples from each site, and stored in 1-litre brown polypropylene plastic containers. A total of 23 PFAS were determined by solid phase extraction and ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Then the risks of non-carcinogenic chemicals was evaluated by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health risk assessment models. [Results] Among the 23 target substances, 14 and 11 kinds of PFAS were detected in all source water and treated water samples (100%), respectively, including perfluorinated carboxylic acid and perfluorinated sulfonic acid; 9 and 12 kinds of PFAS were not detected, respectively, and all were perfluoroamides. The total concentration of PFAS (ΣPFAS) in two types of water was 15.52 to 118.44 ng·L-1, the highest concentrations of dominant perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were 34.79 and 29.99 ng·L-1, respectively, and the concentrations of PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) did not exceed the drinking water threshold (70 ng·L-1) stipulated by US EPA. The ΣPFAS concentration of water source B was 2.7 times that of water source A. Except the perfluoro-1-nonanesulfonate (PFNS) slightly higher in water source A, the concentrations of detected substances in water source B were significantly higher than those in water source A. The concentration of PFAS in water source A showed little difference in different periods, while that in water source B was shown as dry period > level period > wet period. The PFAS in water source A were removed effectively by water treatment processes, as the removal rate was 21.97% by conventional treatment and 64.29% by deep treatment. The removal effect in water source B was not obvious, and the content of contaminants before and after treatment had little changes. The annual personal excess risks of PFOA and PFOS were lower than the maximum acceptable risk (10-6 per year) recommended by the International Committee of Radiological Protection (ICRP). [Conclusion] There is slight PFAS contamination in Shanghai’s drinking water. The annual personal excess risks of PFOS and PFOA via drinking water are low and below the maximum acceptable level recommended by the ICRP. © 2020, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The influence of total organic carbon, total suspended solids, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), leachate flow rates, and meteorological data (precipitation, air temperature) on leachate PFAS concentrations was also investigated. Perfluoropentanoate and perfluorohexanoate were typically the dominant PFASs in leachate, except for March-April, when concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoate, and numerous PFAA-precursors (i.e., (N-alkyl) perfluorooctane sulfonamides and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids) increased by a factor of 2-10 (∼4 μg/L to ∼36 μg/L ∑PFASs).

Bullfrogs are considered a popular aquatic food product in South China, providing high protein and tasty cuisine; however bullfrogs have been shown to contain significant concentrations of PFASs. However, the risk-benefit ratios of PFASs and nutrient contents in cooked bullfrogs are not well understood. PFASs and nutrients were investigated in raw and cooked specimens of cultured and wild bullfrogs in this study. Novel PFASs showed higher detection levels and accumulation in wild bullfrogs than in cultured bullfrogs. Potential factors such as fat and fatty acid ratio affected PFASs accumulation in different tissues and by different cooking methods of bullfrogs. All cooking methods can reduce PFASs in edible tissues while significantly enhancing the nutritive value index (NVI) compared to raw bullfrogs. Steaming was the most effective way to reduce PFASs (rate of reduction was over 66%) and resulted in a lower risk of contributing to arteriosclerosis than other cooking methods assessed by atherogenicity index (AI) values. Cultured bullfrogs instead of wild bullfrogs were recommended for human consumption, and steaming was regarded as a better cooking method in terms of risk-benefit concerns.

Most of these products become municipal solid wastes (MSWs) after they have been used. In the present study, we examined different types of PFASs in leachate, fly ash and bottom ash produced from three MSW incineration plants in southern China. High PFAS levels were found in leachate (mean concentration 215 ng/mL, range 21.4–682 ng/mL) from the incineration plants, which indicated large amounts of PFASs in the wastes leached out. The average quantities of PFASs annually discharged from the leachates of the three plants were estimated to be approximately 384 kg (Plant A), 47.3 kg (Plant B), and 2.82 kg (Plant C). Relatively lower levels of PFASs in fly ash (mean 16.4 ng/g, range 1.46–87.6 ng/g) and bottom ash (mean 14.6 ng/g, range 3.11–77.4 ng/g) indicated that high-temperature incineration destroyed most of the PFASs. The wide array of PFASs concentrations in all three matrices illustrated that some PFASs-containing industrial wastes were still entered into local MSW. In general, short chain PFASs, including perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), were the primary PFASs in leachate samples. In addition, PFOS was the predominant PFASs in fly ash samples.

In the present study, we examined the distribution of 15 PFASs in fish, invertebrates, sediment and water, collected at three sites, representing a gradient of industrial and mining pollution, along the Vaal River, South Africa. Furthermore, possible risks for human health through consumption of contaminated fish were examined. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most dominant PFAS measured in biota, whereas perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) was measured in higher concentrations in water. Mean PFAS concentrations in water ranged from <LOQ to 38.5 ng/L. PFAS concentrations in water decreased along the gradient and were similar or lower compared to other studies in Europe, Asia and America. PFAS measurements in sediment were <LOQ, with the exception of PFOS at Thabela Thabeng (2.36 ng/g dry weight (dw)). Average Sigma PFAS concentrations in biota increased along the gradient and ranged from <LOQ to 34.5 ng/g wet weight (ww) in invertebrates, <LOQ to 289 ng/g ww in liver and <LOQ to 34.0 ng/g ww in muscle tissue. Although PFOS concentrations were relatively high compared to literature, concentrations of other PFASs were rather low. A potential risk for humans through consumption of PFAS-contaminated fish was assessed. Tolerable daily intake values (grams of fish that can be eaten daily without risking health effects) were much lower than the average South African fish consumption per day, implying a potential risk for human health through consumption of PFAS contaminated fish.

Therefore, we investigated the levels of Cl-PFESAs and legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in 276 seafood samples collected from markets in Beijing and assessed the human exposure risks of Cl-PFESAs through seafood intake. C8 Cl-PFESA was the dominant congener with significantly higher concentrations (<LOD-1.27 ng/g) than those of C10 Cl-PFESA (<LOD-0.109 ng/g) and C12 Cl-PFESA (<LOD-0.141 ng/g).

Generally, the concentrations of C8 Cl-PFESA were lower than those of PFOS. However, their concentration trends in four categories of seafood were consistent, with the highest mean concentrations being in shrimps (0.279 and 0.749 ng/g), followed by crabs (0.275 and 0.714 ng/g), fish (0.141 and 0.317 ng/g), and mollusks (0.032 and 0.135 ng/g). A significantly positive correlation was observed between the concentrations of C8 Cl-PFESA and PFOS in all seafood samples (p < 0.001), indicating that they have similar sources and undergo similar environmental processes. The average daily intake of C8 Cl-PFESA (0.067 ng/kg-bw/day) for residents in Beijing via the consumption of seafood was lower than that of PFOS (0.167 ng/kg-bw/day) and far below the most stringent health-based reference dose of PFOS (1.86 ng/kg-bw/day), which implies a low risk for Beijing residents exposed to C8 Cl-PFESA by ingestion of seafood.

Significant correlations (r = 0.311-0.888; p ≤ 0.013) were observed between the concentrations in maternal and cord blood for most PFASs, indicating that PFASs could be efficiently transported from mother to fetus. For perfluorocarboxylates, a U-shaped trend of transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) with increasing carbon chain lengths was confirmed. For PFOA and PFOS branched isomers, TTEs generally increased as the branching point moved closer to the carboxyl or sulfonate moiety, and branched isomers transferred more efficiently than their linear isomers did.

The total concentrations of PFASs ranged from 48.4 to 4578 ng/L in the overlying water, from 173 to 9952 ng/L in the pore water, and from 2.16 to 40.3 ng/g dw in the sediment fraction. Generally, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) were the predominant congeners in the samples, with the mean relative content fractions being almost consistently >40% in the dissolved phase and >25% in the sediment. Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA) were detected, albeit at low levels. In addition, the detection frequency and the contribution of legacy long-chain PFASs in sediment were higher than those in the overlying water and pore water. Except for perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), the concentrations of the alternative PFASs in the pore water were higher than in the overlying water. The organic carbon fraction was a more important controlling factor for PFAS sediment levels than cations content.

Studies on benthic invertebrates have shown them to be subjects of high PFOS exposure. However, effects on benthic invertebrates exposed to PFOS in the field are still far from elucidated. To fill a knowledge gap on concentrations and effects in benthic invertebrates, a microcosm study on the benthic amphipod Monoporeia affinis was performed. Field collected M. affinis were analysed for PFOS and showed average background concentrations 39 and 58 ng/g (wet weight) in two different samplings. The field collected animals were exposed to three concentrations of PFOS (50,200 and 5000 mu g PFOS/L water) for 3 weeks during gonad development. Body burdens of PFOS were determined after experiment termination. Results showed negative effects on survival and reproduction effects such as decreased sexual maturation and decreased oocyte viability caused by PFOS exposure. Additionally, a follow-up experiment demonstrated a significant increase in the infection incidence by a microsporidian muscle parasite in animals exposed to PFOS at tissue concentrations in the range of concentrations found in field collected benthic amphipods. This is the first study to demonstrate increased microsporidian infection with pollutant exposure and it suggests that ecologically relevant PFOS concentrations could be sufficient to elicit these effects.

Large amounts of monitoring data on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in various environmental media have been accumulated, which allows us to conduct a fairly comprehensive assessment of the region around the Bohai and Yellow Seas to elucidate spatial patterns of pollution on a regional scale. This review summarized distributions of traditional and new POPs, including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), in various environmental media. In general, due to their physico-chemical properties (poor solubility in water), OCPs and PCBs were mainly detected in sediments, PBDEs and HBCDs were mainly detected in sediments and soils. PFASs, which have greater solubility, were mainly detected in the hydrosphere. For conventional POPs, such as OCPs and PCBs, Bohai Bay and Haihe River in China, Gyeonggi Bay and Lake Sihwa in South Korea were found to be most polluted areas. While for new POPs, such as PBDEs, HBCDs and PFASs, some areas were heavily polluted due to local production and applications.

Advances in analytical methods have enabled routine detection of more than 15 PFASs in human sera, allowing better profiling of PFAS exposures. The composition of PFASs in human sera reflects the complexity of exposure sources but source identification can be confounded by differences in toxicokinetics affecting uptake, distribution, and elimination. Common PFASs, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and their precursors are ubiquitous in multiple exposure sources. However, their composition varies among sources, which may impact associated adverse health effects. Methods: We use available PFAS concentrations from several demographic groups in a North Atlantic seafood consuming population (Faroe Islands) to explore whether chemical fingerprints in human sera provide insights into predominant exposure sources. We compare serum PFAS profiles from Faroese individuals to other North American populations to investigate commonalities in potential exposure sources. We compare individuals with similar demographic and physiological characteristics and samples from the same years to reduce confounding by toxicokinetic differences and changing environmental releases. Results: Using principal components analysis (PCA) confirmed by hierarchical clustering, we assess variability in serum PFAS concentrations across three Faroese groups. The first principal component (PC)/cluster consists of C9-C12 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) and is consistent with measured PFAS profiles in consumed seafood. The second PC/cluster includes perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and the PFOS precursor N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetate (N-EtFOSAA), which are directly used or metabolized from fluorochemicals in consumer products such as carpet and food packaging. We find that the same compounds are associated with the same exposure sources in two North American populations, suggesting generalizability of results from the Faroese population. Conclusions: We conclude that PFAS homologue profiles in serum provide valuable information on major exposure sources. It is essential to compare samples collected at similar time periods and to correct for demographic groups that are highly affected by differences in physiological processes (e. g., pregnancy). Information on PFAS homologue profiles is crucial for attributing adverse health effects to the proper mixtures or individual PFASs.",NA,10.1186/s12940-018-0355-4,"Humanism;Humanities;Humans;Messenger;Poly A-U;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Polyglactin 910;RNA;RNA, Messenger",NA,NA

We begin in this article by reviewing the available literature on the levels of POPs over the TP. In general, the levels of most POPs are similar or lower than values reported for other background regions. However, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) levels in air and soil far exceed those measured in other mountainous areas. The East Asian monsoon, Indian Monsoon and westerly winds are responsible for the long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) and arrival of POPs over the TP. Surface soil and vegetation act as “final sinks” for DDTs and other high molecular weight POPs. Linked to the continuous use of POPs in surrounding counties, LRAT and “cold trapping” by the TP can happen following emission–transport–deposition events, leading to the enrichment of POPs in the TP environment. Bioaccumulation of DDTs and high chlorinated PCBs have been found in Tibetan terrestrial and aquatic food chains, and newly emerging compounds such as polyfluoroalkyl substances and hexabromocyclododecanes have been widely detected in wild fish species. The corresponding ecological risks should be of great concern. Climate change, such as increased temperatures and changing coverage of snow and glaciers, has the potential to affect the behavior and distribution of POPs. Therefore, long-term monitoring data are required. Ineffective regulation regarding POPs has been reported for countries in South Asia, emissions patterns, the outflow of POPs, and their seasonal and inter-annual variability should therefore be clarified. Estimating the loading of POPs, as well as how they move, within the TP, especially under the impact of glacial melt and global warming, should be a priority.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.107,Atmospheric transport;Hexachlorocyclohexanes;Pollutants;DDT (Insecticide);Organic soil pollutants;Plateau of Tibet,NA,NA

PFOS contamination has entered the food chain and is interfering with normal development in man and is neurotoxic, hepatotoxic and tumorigenic. The earthworm, Eisenia fetida is one of the organisms which can help to diagnose soil health and contamination at lower levels in the food chain. Studying the chronic effects of sub-lethal PFOS exposure in such an organism is therefore appropriate. As PFOS bioaccumulates and is not easily biodegraded, it is biomagnified up the food chain. Gene expression studies will give us information to develop biomarkers for early diagnosis of soil contamination, well before this contaminant passes up the food chain. We have carried out mRNA sequencing of control and chronically PFOS exposed E. fetida and reconstructed the transcripts in silica and identified the differentially expressed genes. Our findings suggest that PFOS up/down regulates neurodegenerative-related human homologues and can cause neuronal damage in E. fetida. This information will help to understand the links between neurodegenerative disorders and environmental pollutants such as PFOS. Furthermore, these up/down regulated genes can be used as biomarkers to detect a sub-lethal presence of PFOS in soil. Neuronal calcium sensor-2, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, polyadenylate-binding protein-1 and mitochondrial Pyruvate dehydrogenase protein-X component, could be potential biomarkers for sub lethal concentrations of PFOS.

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals, which recently have been shown to exceed concentrations of other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in WTE nestlings. Experimental studies suggest that immunomodulation by PFASs occurs at environmentally relevant levels, presenting the need for additional studies to determine if such effects are present in avian wildlife. The first aim of the current study was to investigate the levels of PFASs in plasma and feathers of WTE nestlings, assessing variation relating to differences in sampling location and biological variables. The second aim was to investigate the relationship between PFASs and two structural indicators of the immune system: leukocyte counts and protein fractions. Two WTE populations were sampled: Steigen (n = 14, nests = 9) and Smøla (n = 13, nests = 10). Linear nested models showed that levels of Σ7PFASs in plasma were significantly increasing with age (p < 0.01) and body mass (p < 0.01) in both populations, while suggesting a higher dietary accumulation in nestlings from Steigen (p < 0.01). The levels and detection frequency of PFASs was lower in feathers compared to plasma, and a clear connection between the two matrices could not be established. The current study emphasises the importance of variation explained by variables as age, mass, sex and sampling location when assessing environmental exposure to PFASs. No associations were found between PFASs and protein fractions or leukocyte percentages. The prealbumin (p = 0.004) and γ globulin (p = 0.054) concentrations differed between populations, and prealbumin levels were positively associated with mass (p < 0.01).

Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community.

Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox).

Still not much is known on reciprocal toxicological impact of given chemicals when present in binary or more complex mixtures. In this work, an attempt was thus undertaken to study the impact of butylparaben, methylparaben and diclofenac on toxicological behavior and properties of triclosan (at varying concentration levels) with respect to Microtox, XenoScreen YES/YAS, Caco-2, HEPG2, and liposomal systems. Having performed analytical and biological studies modeling was done using two modeling approaches, viz., concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) at three concentration levels of each chemical studied. The effect of the highest concentration of triclosan studied was impacted by even small amounts of methylparaben and butylparaben in Microtox while diclofenac preferably affected triclosan activity at its lowest concentration level (with CA model). Estrogenic agonistic properties of triclosan were severely impacted by both parabens in an antagonistic way; diclofenac showed in all cases underestimation or synergy at the lowest triclosan concentration studied. Estrogenic antagonistic activity of triclosan was also slightly affected by parabens and by diclofenac in binary mixtures, showing overestimation and antagonist effects. HepG2 cells appeared to be the most resistant to the toxic effect of the mixtures at the concentrations tested and no significant proof of synergy or antagonism could be detected with the MTT assay. The liposome assays on the mixtures followed the same trends obtained with the MTT assay with Caco-2 cells, confirming the validity of the in vitro model used in this research. As studies on emerging contaminants mixtures toxicity are still scarce, research presented here constitute an important part in confirming utility and versatility of emerging contaminants modeling in environmental toxicology.

This study therefore investigates the distribution of silver and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the aquatic environment of Skudai River, Johor, Malaysia. Water, sediment, plant, and fish samples were collected seasonally along four sites along Skudai River between May 2018 and April 2019. All samples were subjected to Ag analysis using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The analysis demonstrated that the concentration of Ag detected in water samples ranging from 0.001 to 0.505 mg/L was the lowest, whereas in the plants, 0.235 to 4.713 mg/kg of Ag was quantified. The upper sediments contained 0.036 to 28.115 mg/kg of Ag, whilst fish samples presented the highest accumulation of Ag, averaging between 9.144 and 53.784 mg/kg of Ag. Subsequently, the formation of silver nanoparticles was further proven by TEM-EDX analysis, where the detected size of AgNPs ranged from 20 nm to 35 nm. The overriding conclusion implied by bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) calculations suggested that Skudai River was indeed polluted by Ag and AgNPs.

Due to its long residence time in the environment and semi-volatile nature, they are prone for long range atmospheric transport (LRAT), resulting in transboundary deposition. The Stockholm Convention on POPs, regulates these contaminants, by imposing restrictions on production and use or recommend to phase out these compounds. POPs could be classified into three groups, namely, organochlorine pesticides, industrial chemicals and unintentionally produced by-products during various industrial processes. The Stockholm Convention initially classified 12 compounds as POPs, which are generally referred to as “dirty dozen.” Subsequently, another 16 compounds, mostly industrial chemicals were added to this list. Due to advancement in instrumental analytical techniques driven by stringent regulations on chemicals, the scientific community has pointed out that several chemicals, mostly high production volume (HPV) industrial chemicals have POPs like properties, and hence they should be regulated as POPs in order to safeguard human health and environment. Some of these compounds have been introduced as substitutes to compounds already listed as POPs. Examples includes hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), organophosphorous flame retardants, per- and polyfluroalkyl substances (PFAS; C4-C6 fluoro compounds), short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA).

Despite the complexity of site-specific factors, some general trends and correlations in PFAA concentrations were observed. For instance, perfluoro-1-octanesulfonate (PFOS) dominated in all soil samples while seven other PFAA, including perfluoro-n-nonanoic acid, perfluoro-n-octanoic acid, perfluoro-n-hexanoic acid, perfluoro-n-heptanoic acid, perfluoro-n-decanoic acid, perfluoro-n-undecanoic acid, perfluoro-1-butanesulfonate, and perfluoro-1-hexanesulfonate (PFNA, PFOA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFDA, PFUnDA, and PFBS, respectively), were identified at more than 50 % of the locations.

This study includes a review of the current state of knowledge regarding mechanisms and models of intestinal absorption and biomagnification of organic chemicals in organisms of aquatic and terrestrial food chains and also includes a discussion of the implications of these models for assessing the bioaccumulation potential of organic chemicals. Four mechanistic models, including biomass conversion, digestion or gastrointestinal magnification, micelle-mediated diffusion, and fat-flush diffusion, are evaluated. The models contain many similarities and represent an evolution in understanding of chemical bioaccumulation processes. An important difference between the biomagnification models is whether intestinal absorption of an ingested contaminant occurs solely via passive molecular diffusion through serial resistances or via facilitated diffusion that incorporates an additional advective transport mechanism in parallel (i.e., molecular ferrying within gastrointestinal micelles). This difference has an effect on the selection of physicochemical properties that best anticipate the bioaccumulative potential of commercial chemicals in aquatic and terrestrial food chains. Current regulatory initiatives utilizing K-OW threshold criteria to assess chemical bioaccumulation potential are shown to be unable to identify certain bioaccumulative substances in air-breathing animals.

The objective of this study is to present an initial evaluation of the ubiquitous, ambient environmental distribution of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) within the context of environmental decision-making at contaminated sites. PFAS are anthropogenic contaminants of emerging concern with a wide variety of consumer and industrial sources and uses that result in multiple exposure routes for humans. The combination of widespread prevalence and low screening levels introduces considerable uncertainty and potential costs in the environmental management of PFAS. PFAS are not naturally-occurring, but are frequently detected in environmental media independent of site-specific (i.e., point source) contamination. Information was collected on background and ambient levels of two predominant PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate, in North America in both abiotic media (soil, sediment, surface water, and public drinking water supplies) and selected biotic media (human tissues, fish, and shellfish). The background or ambient information was compiled from multiple published sources, organized by medium and concentration ranges, and evaluated for geographical trends and, when available, also compared to health-based screening levels. Data coverage and quality varied from wide-ranging and well-documented for soil, surface water, and serum data to more localized and less well-documented for sediment and fish and shellfish tissues and some uncertainties in the data were noted. Widespread ambient soil and sediment concentrations were noted but were well below human health-protective thresholds for direct contact exposures. Surface water, drinking water supply waters (representing a combination of groundwater and surface water), fish and shellfish tissue, and human serum levels ranged from less than to greater than available health-based threshold values.

Furthermore, bioaccumulation specificities and prediction of these chemicals in different vegetables were explored, followed by a comprehensive risk assessment from agricultural fields to dinner plates which considered precursor degradation. A positive matrix factorization model revealed that approximately 70 % of PFASs in agricultural soils were derived from fluorochemical manufacturing and metal processing. Alarming levels of ∑PFASs ranged 8.28–84.3 ng/g in soils and 163–7176 ng/g in vegetables. PFAS with short carbon chain or carboxylic acid group as well as branched isomers exhibited higher environmental transport potentials and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) across a range of vegetables. The BAFs of different isomers of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) decreased as the perfluoromethyl group moved further from the acid functional group. Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) showed relatively low BAFs, probably related to its ether bond with a high affinity to soil. Vegetables with fewer Casparian strips (e.g., carrot and radish), or more protein, possessed larger BAFs of PFASs. A bioaccumulation equation integrating critical parameters of PFASs, vegetables and soils, was built and corroborated with a good contamination prediction. After a total oxidizable precursors (TOP) assay, incremental perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were massively found (325–5940 ng/g) in edible vegetable parts.

Finally, extraction of selected samples with synthetic sweat showed that ionic PFAS, particularly those with fluorinated carbons ≤8, can migrate from fabric to sweat, suggesting a potential dermal route of exposure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115477,PFAS;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Chromatography;United States;Polymers;Child;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;chemical compound;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;perfluoroalkyl substance;liquid chromatography;mass spectrometry;gas chromatography;human;child;organofluorine derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;mass fragmentography;child health;Consumer products;polymer;Gas chromatography;fluorine;Children;spectroscopy;ultraviolet radiation;Emission spectroscopy;Fluorine;Water Pollutants;Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry;ultraviolet irradiation;Chemical;indoor air;Liquid;Fluorotelomers;Organofluorine;Fluorine content;fluorotelomer acrylate;X ray photoemission spectroscopy;Gamma rays;Foams;(meth)acrylate;child restraint system;Child Restraint Systems;Fabric samples;Gamma-ray emission;Laminated composites;LC/MS/MS;particle included gamma ray emission spectroscopy;side chain fluorotelomer based polymer;Ultraviolet irradiations;Uranium metallography;Vanadium metallography;X ray photoelectron spectroscopy;Only Child;Polymerization,NA,NA

This work was undertaken to evaluate the possible effects of PFOS exposure on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis (HPT) in adult male rats, and to evaluate the possible morphological alterations induced by PFOS in the endocrine tissues of this axis. Adult male rats were orally treated with 0.5; 1.0; 3.0 and 6.0. mg of PFOS/kg/day for 28 days. After PFOS exposure, hypothalamic noradrenaline concentration increased in the anterior hypothalamus and in the median eminence, not changing in the mediobasal hypothalamus. PFOS treated rats presented a decrease of the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) gene expression, increasing the mRNA levels of the luteinizing hormone (LH) in rats treated with all doses administered except with the dose of 6. mg/kg/day. PFOS also induced a raise of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) gene expression in the animals exposed to 0.5 and 1.0. mg of PFOS/kg/day. After PFOS exposure, hypothalamic GnRH concentration was modified, LH and testosterone release was inhibited and FSH secretion was stimulated. Moreover, PFOS induced several histopathological alterations in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and testis. The results obtained in the present study suggest in general terms that PFOS can inhibit the physiological activity of the reproductive axis in adult male rats, which could be explained, at least in part, by the structural alterations showed in the animals exposed to this chemical: very dense chromatin, condensed ribosomes and a loss of the morphology in the hypothalamus; a degeneration of the gonadotrophic cells, as well as a loss and degeneration of the spermatozoids and a very marked edema in the testis. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2014.07.006,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Animals;Article;Rats;animal;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);adult;alkanesulfonic acid;gene expression;sulfonate;article;reproductive biology;priority journal;endocrine disruptor;hormone;rat;physiology;nucleotide sequence;histopathology;messenger RNA;Activity;drug effects;Rattus;rodent;cell organelle;testosterone;testosterone blood level;Testis;hypophysis;luteinizing hormone;follitropin;spermatozoon;testis;inhibition;hypothalamus;fluid intake;beta actin;gonadorelin;Leydig cell;hypothalamus hypophysis system;luteinizing hormone release;noradrenalin;condensation;anterior hypothalamus;follitropin release;gonadotropin secreting cell;Histopathology;Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System;hypothalamus hypophysis gonad system;median eminence;mediobasal hypothalamus;Reproductive axis;seminiferous tubule;testosterone release;Sulfones,NA,NA

These compounds generally explain <50 % of the total PFAS in human blood. The percentage of known PFAS in human blood has been decreasing as replacement PFAS and more complex PFAS chemistries are introduced to the market. Most of these novel PFAS have not been previously identified. Non-targeted methods are required to characterize this “dark matter” PFAS. Our objective was to apply non-targeted PFAS analysis to human blood to gain an understanding about the sources, concentrations, and toxicity of these compounds. A high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS) and software workflow for PFAS characterization in dried blood spots is reported. Dried blood spots are a less invasive collection technique compared to venous blood draws, allowing collection from vulnerable populations. Biorepositories of archived dried blood spots are available internationally from newborns and present opportunities to study prenatal exposure to PFAS. In this study, dried blood spot cards were analyzed using iterative MS/MS by liquid chromatography HRMS. Data processing was conducted using FluoroMatch Suite including a visualizer tool that presents homologous series, retention time vs m/z plots, MS/MS spectra, feature tables, annotations, and fragments for fragment screening. The researcher performing data-processing and annotation was blinded to the fact that standards were spiked in, and was able to annotate 95 % of standards spiked on dried blood spot samples, signifying a low false negative rate using FluoroMatch Suite. A total of 28 PFAS (20 standards and 4 exogenous compounds) were detected across five homologous series with Schymanski Level 2 confidence. Of these 4, 3 were perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECA), a chemical class of PFAS which is increasingly being detected in environmental and biological matrices but is not currently screened in most targeted analysese. A further 86 potential PFAS were detected using fragment screening. PFAS are extremely persistent and widespread yet remain largely unregulated. Our findings will contribute to an improved an understanding of exposures. Application of these methods in environmental epidemiology studies have the potential to inform policy with regards to PFAS monitoring, regulation, and individual-level mitigation strategies. © 2023",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163579,PFAS;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Carboxylic Acids;Ethers;Chromatography;Pregnancy;Infant;Newborn;Blood;female;fluorocarbon;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;liquid chromatography;procedures;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;mass spectrometry;human;article;epidemiology;newborn;carboxylic acid;Environmental regulations;blood;prenatal exposure;ether derivative;pregnancy;Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometries;Human bloods;Non-targeted;software;vulnerable population;Liquid;workflow;Data handling;Iterative methods;Non-targeted analyse;biobank;Dried blood spot;dried blood spot testing;Dried blood spots;Homologous series;Liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry;mitigation;Non-targeted analysis;venous blood;Whole blood,NA,NA

The constant of proportionality required by the models successfully predicted the correlation between the biotic and abiotic distributions of both sets of chemicals, thus demonstrating the applicability of the assumptions inherent in the models, that is, hydrophobically driven partitioning of the neutral species, and thus the applicability of the models themselves. Colloquially speaking, the models are thus validated as applicable to these chemicals. Subsequent application of the standard equilibrium models showed order of magnitude agreement for 83% of measured BCF values and 88% of measured D SW for the perfluorinated carboxylic acids, confirming the physical chemical properties used. The applicability of the models to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOSA) was shown by the successful prediction of D SW from BCF. Therefore, the measured D SW and BCF could be used to calculate the octanol-water distribution, D OW, and hence the corresponding pK a:K OW solution set, thus providing independent experimentally based estimates of these properties.

We also measured circulating levels of thyroid hormones (THs) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the whales. The results confirm that OHC levels in these white whales are among the highest levels recorded in wildlife from Svalbard, and at the high end of the range when compared to white whales from the North American Arctic. A projection to latent structure (PLS) model (subadults and adult males grouped together) revealed that known or suspected thyroid disruptive contaminants (polybrominated diphenylether [PBDE]-28. -47, -99, -100, and -154, hexachlorobenzene [HCB], and PCB-105) were negatively correlated with circulating levels of total thyroxin (TT4), free T4 (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). Most of these negative relationships were also confirmed using partial correlations controlling for length (and thus age) of the whales. The positive correlations of 114, FT4 and FT3 with hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), chlorinated bornanes CHB-40 and CHB-62 revealed by the PLS model were not confirmed by partial correlations. TH levels in the present study appeared to be somewhat lower than levels measured in beluga whales from the Canadian Arctic. However, we were not able to determine if this was caused by different levels of OHCs, or differences in biological factors (e.g. age, sex, moulting status, and season) and analytical methods between the studies. Although the sample sizes were low and statistical models cannot depict the biological cause-effect relationships, this study suggests negative influences of specific OHCs, particularly PBDEs, on thyroid hormone levels in white whales. The impact this might have on individual and population health is unknown. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

PFAS-contaminated soil acts as a long-term source of pollution to the adjacent surface water bodies, groundwater, soil microorganisms, and soil invertebrates. While several remediation strategies exist to eliminate PFASs from the soil, strong ionic interactions between charged groups on PFAS with soil constituents rendered these PFAS remediation technologies ineffective. Pilot and field-scale data from recent studies have shown a great potential of PFAS to bio-accumulate and distribute within plant compartments suggesting that phytoremediation could be a potential remediation technology to clean up PFAS contaminated soils. Even though several studies have been performed on the uptake and translocation of PFAS by different plant species, most of these studies are limited to agricultural crops and fruit species. In this review, the role of both aquatic and terrestrial plants in the phytoremediation of PFAS was discussed highlighting different mechanisms underlying the uptake of PFASs in the soil–plant and water-plant systems. This review further summarized a wide range of factors that influence the bioaccumulation and translocation of PFASs within plant compartments including both structural properties of PFASs and physiological properties of plant species. Even though phytoremediation appears to be a promising remediation technique, some limitations that reduced the feasibility of phytoremediation in the practical application have been emphasized in previous studies.

The aim of the present study was to examine meromictic lakes and their catchments on the far northern coast of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada, and to evaluate the results in the context of climate change. Our analyses revealed the presence of several PFCs in catchment snowpack, inflowing streams, lake water, and the aquatic food web of Lake A (83 degrees 00'N, 75 degrees 30'W), showing that dispersal of these contaminants reaches the northern limit of the terrestrial High Arctic. However, the concentrations were low (total PFCs: 27-754 pg L-1 for water, 134-848 pg L-1 for melted snow, 5-2149 pg g(-1) wet weight for fish; PFOS: 66 pg g(-1) dry weight in surficial sediments) and at or below values reported to date in the literature for other remote lakes. PFHpA, PFOA, and PFNA were the main compounds detected in water and melted snow, while PFNA, PFDA, and PFUnA were the predominant compounds in the aquatic biota, indicating their bioaccumulative potential. Salinity-temperature-depth profiles suggested that most of the present contaminant load enters the lake via streams and flows directly under the lake ice to the ocean.

Because juvenile fish are sensitive to environmental pollutants, in the present study, histological assessment and tran-scriptome sequencing were performed to determine the short-term impact of PFOA on juvenile half-smooth tongue soles. Histological analysis showed that PFOA exposure caused hepatocyte rupture, intestinal villi breakage, increased goblet cell count, and brain abnormal. Transcriptome results showed that some interesting signaling pathways, such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, PPAR signaling pathway and GABAergic synapse signaling pathway, were enriched after PFOA exposure. In addition, some metabolic, immune and neural genes were differentially expressed, which including ependymin, hbb1-like and gad 1, and they were up-regulated after 14 days of exposure.

Diet is usually the dominating exposure pathway, and in particular the intake of PFOS has been shown to be strongly related to the consumption of fish and seafood. Those who eat freshwater fish may be especially at risk since freshwater and its biota typically display higher PFOS concentrations than marine systems. In this study, we estimated the range in PFOS intake among average Swedish “normal” and “high” consumers of freshwater fish. By average we mean persons of average weight who eat average-sized portions. The “normal consumers” were assumed to eat freshwater fish 3 times per year, and the “high consumers” once a week. Under these assumptions, the yearly tolerable intake for “normal” and “high” consumers is reached when the PFOS concentrations in fish equals 59 and 3.4 μg per kg fish meat. For this study, PFOS concentrations in the muscle tissue of edible-sized perch, pike and pikeperch were retrieved from three different Swedish datasets, covering both rural and urban regions and a total of 78 different inland waters. Mean PFOS concentrations in fish from these sites varied from 0.3 to 750 μg/kg. From the available data, the annual min-max dietary PFOS intake for male “normal consumers” was found to be in the range 0.0021–5.4 μg/kg/yr for the evaluated scenarios, with median values of 0.02–0.16 μg/kg/yr. For male “high consumers”, the total intake range was estimated to be 0.04–93 μg/kg/yr, with median values being 0.27–1.6 μg/kg/yr. For women, the exposure estimates were slightly lower, about 79% of the exposure in men. Despite highly variable PFOS concentrations in fish from different sites, we conclude that the three most commonly consumed freshwater species in Sweden constitute an important source for the total annual intake even for people who eat this kind of fish only a few times per year. The analyses of PFOA, PFNA and PFHxS showed values which were all below detection limit, and their contribution to the total PFAS intake via freshwater fish consumption is negligible in comparison to PFOS. © 2020 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110284,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Animals;Article;Sweden;Food Contamination;Risk Factors;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;animal experiment;comparative study;controlled study;dietary intake;food contamination;environmental monitoring;animal tissue;chemical compound;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;urban area;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;biota;muscle;Perfluorinated compounds;human;dietary exposure;Dietary intake;rural area;body weight;priority journal;fish meat;food safety;mercury;perfluorononanoic acid;food intake;feeding behavior;risk factor;salmonine;Fishes;Human exposure;fresh water;freshwater species;tuna;Fresh Water;urban region;consumer;Food contamination;freshwater fish;fish consumption;perch;fishing;anchovy;sardine;Freshwater fish;Esox lucius;Esocidae;fish meal;migrant;Perca fluviatilis;portion size,NA,NA

This need is particularly important in the Southern Ocean, where Fe limitation is wide spread and access is difficult especially in winter. To address this need, we have developed an autonomous system capable of observing iron concentrations over a full seasonal cycle, at the subnanomolar concentrations that are important in the open ocean.

The concept of biochar was originally triggered from the ancient practice in which humans deliberately mixed carbonized biomass into soils to enrich the soil quality and fertility. According to the International Biochar Initiative (IBI), biochar can be defined as “a solid material obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment.” Biomass-derived biochar production has been demonstrated as a potentially viable strategy for developing negative carbon emission technologies for climate change mitigation and as a material for effective amendment of relatively poor agricultural soils. Most interestingly, ongoing biochar research work has expanded broadly, stretching from its traditional core in the environmental and agricultural science to studies in the use of biochar for energy generation and as adsorbents for pollution treatment applications. The use of biochar for carbon sequestration and soil amendment has also attracted more interests by research scientists globally. Application of biochar as a material for soil amendment is closely linked with its potential for climate change mitigation by carbon sequestration. Specifically, the properties of biochar include resistance to microbial degradation and chemical transformations, high surface areas, high water retention capacity, cation-exchange capacity, porosity, and its effectiveness as support and substrate for soil microbes. These characteristics endow biochar with a greater potential to become a highly useful material for improving agricultural productivity through soil quality enhancement while simultaneously sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere to mitigate climate change. Although activated carbon is the most popular and widely used adsorbent for organic pollutants, several studies have proven that biochars derived from biomaterials are effective in the removal of a variety of pollutants, including a group of emerging environmental pollutants called perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). These harmful synthetic contaminants are widely distributed in the environment and are known as “forever chemicals” due to their persistent nature. Moreover, biochar ability to absorb electromagnetic radiation and emit far-infrared wavelength radiation has promoted research, development, and commercialization of biochar’s applications in medical and health therapies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

Species dominating the upper trophic level are vulnerable to these effects due to bioaccumulation. In Bass Strait, the Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) is an important top order predator and sentinel species for ecosystem health. An alopecia syndrome is seen at high prevalence in juvenile, female Australian fur seals at Lady Julia Percy Island, Victoria, Australia. Previous investigations suggest causality could be due to an endocrine-like toxicant. The alopecia syndrome has significance for thermoregulation and is a likely risk factor for mortality. Fur collected from case (alopecic) and control (unaffected) seals sampled at Lady Julia Percy Island were analysed for POPs. To investigate the utility of fur for monitoring POPs concentrations in pinnipeds, a comparison of POPs concentrations in the fur and blubber of Australian fur seals stranded along the Victorian coast was undertaken. The concentration of selected POPs including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate/perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOS/PFOA) were determined in fur using either High Resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Results indicate detectable, and in some individuals, elevated levels of dl-PCBs, PCDD/Fs and PBDEs in juvenile fur seals sampled on Lady Julia Percy Island, with significantly higher levels of dl-PCBs in case compared to control seals. Elevated levels of dl-PCBs and PCDD/Fs were found in blubber samples collected from stranded fur seals with significant correlations between blubber and fur concentrations seen, particularly for dl-PCBs. This study discusses the significance of POPs concentrations in relation to the causality of an alopecia syndrome in the Australian fur seal, and assesses the utility of fur as a non-invasive biomarker to monitor POPs exposure in this sentinel species.

Twelve PFCs, consisting of perfluorinated carboxylic (PFCA) and sulfonic (PFSA) acids as well as the perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) precursor perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), were measured in livers of 68 beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) collected from two subpopulations, Cook Inlet and eastern Chukchi Sea, in Alaska between 1989 and 2006. PFOS and PFOSA were the dominant compounds measured in both beluga stock populations, with overall median concentrations of 10.8 ng/g and 22.8 ng/g, respectively. Long-chain perfluorocarboxylates, PFCAs (9 to 14 carbons), were detected in more than 80% of the samples. Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA) and perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTriA) made up a large percentage of the PFCAs measured with median concentrations of 8.49 ng/g and 4.38 ng/g, respectively. To compare differences in location, year, sex, and length, backward stepwise multiple regression models of the individual and total PFC concentrations were used. Spatially, the Cook Inlet belugas had higher concentrations of most PFCAs and PFOS (p < 0.05); however, these belugas had a lower median concentration of PFOSA when compared to belugas from the eastern Chukchi Sea (p < 0.05). Temporal trends indicated most PFCAs, PFHxS, PFOS, and PFOSA concentrations increased from 1989 to 2006 (p < 0.05). Males had significantly higher concentrations of PFTriA, ΣPFCA, and PFOS (p < 0.05). Perfluorononanic acid (PFNA) and PFOS showed a significant decrease in concentration with increasing animal length (p < 0.05). These observations suggest the accumulation of PFCs in belugas is influenced by year, location, sex, and length. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

These emerging substances are of concern given their resistance to degradation and metabolization. Some studies have reported endocrine disrupting effects for some PFASs. However, there is a gap of knowledge on the potential relationships between PFASs and hormones mediating the life-history trade-off between reproduction and survival, such as glucocorticoids. The aims of this study were to (1) describe the concentrations of plasma perfluoroalkyl sulfonates and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates in Svalbard black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) in relation to gender and body-condition, (2) explore the relationships between PFASs and corticosterone (the major glucocorticoid in birds), and (3) assess the consequences of PFAS exposure for reproductive success. Perfluorononanoate was positively related to body-condition in male kittiwakes; perfluorotridecanoate and perfluorotetradecanoate to decreased baseline corticosterone in both sexes; and perfluorododecanoate was related to lower hatching success.

Ivory gulls must cope with not only the reduction in sea ice cover triggered by climate change but also increasing contaminant loads due to changes in global contaminant pathways and the release of previously stored pollutants from melting snow and ice. This top predator may be affected by biomagnification processes of a variety of compounds with concentrations dramatically increasing from water to higher trophic levels. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the contaminant bioaccumulation of this species in four colonies located on Barentsøya, Svalbard, in link with its trophic behaviour. To that end, contaminants, including organochlorines (OCs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs), were determined in the blood (plasma and whole blood) of ivory gulls sampled over several years. Carbon- and nitrogen-stable isotopes were also determined in different tissues (feathers, plasma and red blood cells, or whole blood) to infer the trophic level (δ15N) and feeding habitat (δ13C) during both the breeding and moulting periods. The most quantitatively abundant contaminants found in the ivory gull were p,p′-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), ΣPCB (polychlorobiphenyl), and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulphonate). Several compounds including most of the PFASs, trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor, and BDE-28 were correlated with nitrogen values. This study highlighted variability in trophic behaviour among individuals during the breeding and the moulting periods. Overall, similar feeding habitats and strategies were used between breeding sites which was echoed by similar contaminant levels. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,10.1007/s00300-016-2018-7,Svalbard;Persistent organic pollutants;chemical pollutant;Arctic;seabird;trophic level;bioaccumulation;concentration (composition);Isotopes;Perfluorinated alkyl substances;pollution effect;organic pollutant;organic compound;breeding site;arctic environment;behavioral response;Pagophila eburnea;Ivory gull;Barentsoya;colony structure;isotopic analysis;Jan Mayen;trophic environment,NA,NA

This study assessed the impact of tetracycline (TC, 5-20 mg L-1) and titanium dioxide (TiO2, 500-2000 mg L-1) NPs co-exposure on rice (Oryza sativa L.) under a 10 d hydroponic exposure. Plant biomass, contaminant content (TC, Ti), oxidative stress enzymes, and macro-/micronutrient contents were measured in rice shoots and roots as a function of exposure. Under TC alone exposure, dose-dependent toxicity (biomass, oxidative stress enzymes) and TC accumulation were observed and the levels of several key elemental nutrients were decreased. For example, root biomass treated with 5 and 20 mg L-1 TC was reduced by 18.8% and 62.5%, respectively, relative to the control. The contents of K, P, and S in 10 and 20 mg L-1 TC treated rice shoots were approximately 80% of the unamended control. Under co-exposure, the presence of TiO2 NPs significantly enhanced the TC treated rice growth in terms of plant size and total biomass. In addition, TiO2 NPs significantly reduced the levels of TC in rice shoots and roots, as well as oxidative stress enzymes, back to the level of unamended controls and also enabled recovery of TC-induced nutrient deficiency. It is worth mentioning that both contaminants resulted in severe iron deficiency (44-76% decreases of Fe in all the treatments were evident) under both single and co-exposure treatments. Abiotic sorption data indicates that TC phytotoxicity was prevented due to sorption of the antibiotic onto NP TiO2 (a maximum amount was 2.62 mg g(-1)), resulting in significantly decreased availability to the rice seedlings. The presence of TC increased the Ti content in rice roots, which could be ascribed to the alteration of surface charges of TiO(2)NPs as affected by TC. Antagonistic and synergistic effects of TiO2 NPs and TC on rice were analyzed using three methods, including toxicity unit (TU), additional index (AI), and mixture toxicity index (MTI), all of which indicated under co-exposing condition, TiO2 NPs and TC interacted antagonistically, resulting in an overall alleviation of phytotoxicity and enhanced plant health.",NA,10.1039/c7en00280g,Tetracycline;Tetracyclines;Titanium;Oryza sativa,NA,NA

The distribution of PFASs between water, sediment, and periphytic biofilm was investigated at three sampling sites along a longitudinal gradient upstream and downstream from the Paris urban area. Seasonal variability was assessed through four sampling campaigns performed under contrasting hydrological conditions. In the dissolved phase, aPFASs fluctuated between 2 and 9 ng L-1 upstream and 6-105 ng L-1 downstream from Paris. Negative correlations between dissolved PFAS levels and river flow rate were generally observed, corroborating the predominance of point-source PFAS inputs at these sites. 18/19 target PFASs were detected, with a predominance of PFHxS and PFOS (20% of aPFASs each), except for the farthest downstream site where 6:2 FTSA was prevalent (35 +/- 8% of aPFASs), likely reflecting industrial and urban inputs. In biofilms, aPFASs fell in the 4-32 ng g(-1) dw range, and substantial bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were reported for PFNA, PFDA, and PFOS (log BCF 2.1-4.3), higher than those of PFHxS or PFOA. BCFs varied inversely with dissolved PFAS levels, potentially pointing to concentration-dependent bioaccumulation.

Brood patch provides efficient heat transfer between the incubating parent and the developing embryo in the egg. Importantly, several environmental contaminants are already known to have adverse effects on avian reproduction. However, relatively little is known about the effect of contaminants on incubation temperature (T inc ) in wild birds. By using temperature thermistors placed into artificial eggs, we investigated whether the most contaminated parent birds are less able to provide appropriate egg warming and thus less committed to incubating their clutch. Specifically, we investigated the relationships among 3 groups of contaminants (organochlorines, perfluoroalkyl substances [PFASs], and mercury [Hg]) with T inc and also with prolactin concentrations and brood patch size in incubating Arctic black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Our results reveal that among the organochlorines considered, only blood levels of oxychlordane, the main metabolite of chlordane, a banned pesticide, were negatively related to the minimum incubation temperature in male kittiwakes. Levels of PFASs and Hg were unrelated to T inc in kittiwakes. Moreover, our study suggests a possible underlying mechanism: since we reported a significant and negative association between blood oxychlordane concentrations and the size of the brood patch in males. Finally, this reduced T inc in the most oxychlordane-contaminated kittiwakes was associated with a lower egg hatching probability.

This work assessed the concentrations of selected contaminants of emerging concern in water and sediment of European aquaculture areas, to evaluate their co-variation with legacy contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and faecal biomarkers, and estimate the risks associated with their occurrence. The 9 study sites were selected in 7 European countries to be representative of the aquaculture activities of their region: 4 sites in the Atlantic Ocean and 5 in the Mediterranean Sea. Musks, UV filters, preservatives, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in at least one of the sites with regional differences. While personal care products appear to be the main component of the water contamination, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were mostly found in sediments. As expected, generally higher levels of personal care products were found in sewage impacted sites, urbanised coasts and estuaries. The risk assessment for water and sediment revealed a potential risk for the local aquatic environment from contaminants of both legacy and emerging concern, with a significant contribution of the UV filter octocrylene.

The multiscalar study of plastics and PFASs at a large spatial scale is rare; the results produced in recent years on the Seine River catchment have provided an original contribution to the investigation of the dynamics of these contaminants in urban environments. The results also highlighted that pathogenic protozoa are ubiquitous in the Seine River basin and that the contamination of bivalves such as Dreissena polymorpha could reflect the ambient biological contamination of watercourses. The widespread occurrence of antibiotics in the Seine River was demonstrated, and it was shown that the resistome of biofilms in highly urbanised rivers constitutes a microenvironment where genetic support for antibiotic resistance (clinical integrons) and resistance genes for trace metals are concentrated. © 2020, The Author(s).",NA,10.1007/698_2019_381,Bioaccumulation;Antibiotics;Contaminants of emerging concern;Antibiotic resistance;Water;Sediment;perfluoroalkyl substances;Poly-;microplastics;Macro-;Pathogenic protozoa;PIREN-Seine;Zone Atelier Seine,NA,NA

Recently, F-53B has been frequently identified in the aquatic environment and wild-caught fish. However, studies on the uptake and elimination kinetics, and the toxicological effects of F-53B were very scarce. In this study, zebrafish larvae (72 h post fertilization, hpf) were exposed to F-53B (10, 100 μg/L) for 48 h, followed by a 24 h of depuration to examine both the dynamics of accumulation and elimination of F-53B and responses of antoxidant defense system in fish. The results showed that F-53B rapidly accumulated in zebrafish larvae in a concentration and time-dependent manner with BCF values of 3612–3615, but was eliminated slowly (half-life ranged from 241.5 to 258.6 h). F-53B exposure induced oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae, as reflected by the reduction in the GSH and MDA contents, CAT, SOD, CuZn-SOD, and GSH-ST activities, and the increase in GSH-Px activity as well as CAT and SOD protein levels. However, these oxidative stress markers were restored to control levels except for a decrease in protein level of SOD after depuration. Collectively, the results of this work indicate that F-53B behaves like PFOS and is bioaccumulative and persistent in zebrafish larvae, and further induced oxidative stress responses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.10.025,Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;Oxidative Stress;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;comparative study;bioaccumulation;biological marker;biomarker;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;protein;water pollutant;Biomarkers;chemical compound;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;oxidative stress;high performance liquid chromatography;quantitative analysis;sulfonic acid derivative;drug effect;embryo;toxicokinetics;F-53B;metabolism;Western blotting;zebra fish;glutathione;analysis;LC50;multiple reaction monitoring;chemical reaction;Zebrafish;elimination half-life;aquatic environment;ether;cyprinid;Danio rerio;Proteins;superoxide dismutase;Oxidative stress;reaction kinetics;surface property;antioxidant;Accumulation;steady state;Alkanesulfonates;Oxidative stress response;Water Pollutants;Elimination;antioxidant activity;growth hormone;Chemical;4;2;5;1;3;larva;Larva;6;Plating;2-((6-chloro-1;2-tetrafluoroethanesulfonic acid;6-dodecafluorohexyl)oxy)-1;Superoxide Dismutase;analogs;chlorinated polyafluorinated ether sulfonate;derivatives;metal industry;Oxidative stress biomarkers;Oxidative stress markers;poriferasterol monoglucoside;reduction (chemistry);stigmasterol;Stigmasterol;Biological Markers,NA,NA

However, the impact of chronic PFOS exposure on liver disease progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we for the first time revealed that micromolar range of PFOS exposure initiates the activation of NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome to drive hepatocyte pyroptosis. We showed that 5 mg/kg/day PFOS exposure may exacerbated liver inflammation and steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice with concurrently elevated expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1. PFOS exposure resulted in viability impairment and LDH release in BRL-3A rat liver cells. 25–100 μM concentrations of PFOS exposure activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to consequent GSDMD cleavage, IL-1β release and the initiation of pyroptosis in a dose-dependent manner, whereas treatment with 10 μM NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 abrogated this effect. Moreover, pretreatment of 5 mM ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) ameliorated PFOS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis.

Given their divergent properties, these pollutants have different pathways of transport in the biosphere and entry into food webs. The adverse effects of these pollutants on human health are well documented and have led to regulatory actions, including fish consumption advisories. The banning of production and use of several chemicals, and the emission abatement of others [e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT, and two priority per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs)], have resulted in measurable decreases in their concentrations in the oceans.

Thirty-six saturated, unsaturated, or branched-chain FAs with a chain length of C8-C28 were quantified using reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. FAs in plasma (10 mu L) were acid-hydrolyzed, extracted, and derivatized with DAABD-AE (4-[2-(N,N-Dimethylamino)ethylaminosulfonyl]-7-(2-aminoethylamino)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole) at 60 degrees C for 1 h. Derivatization resulted in a staggering nine orders of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to underivatized analytes. FAs were measured by multiple-reaction monitoring using stable isotope internal standards. With physiological and pathological analyte levels in mind, linearity was established using spiked plasma.

The two most studied compounds of PFAS are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). PFOS is toxic, highly persistent, carcinogenic and bioaccumulative in the environment. PFOS has been widely used as an active ingredient in the firefighting foams, stain repellent in leather apparel, for paper and packaging, which has imposed a concern for the environment and the human health. To reduce the human health risks from PFOS, it is important to investigate the fate and transfer of PFOS in the food chain. In this study, a glasshouse pot experiment was conducted for 119 days to evaluate the uptake and accumulation of PFOS in three selected home-grown vegetables. The results showed that there was considerable accumulation of PFOS in different parts of the vegetables. The calculated bioconcentration factors (BCF) suggested that the uptake of PFOS increased with an increase in the soil PFOS concentration in lettuce roots and hearts. Whereas the BCF increased for carrot shoots and roots at PFOS concentrations of 0.23 and 4 mg/kg soil but decreased at the highest concentration of PFOS (40 mg/kg soil) used in this study. The daily intake rates of PFOS via vegetable consumption were found higher than the tolerable daily intake for children of age 2-6 years as per Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). Besides, it can be suggested that if the vegetables were planted in the similar contaminated soils, the BCF would be high resulting an increase in the concentration of PFOS in the plant components. This study demonstrates the potential risk of PFOS to humans/animals via food chain. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Cooking fish can reduce exposure to many organic chemicals in fish. Similar results have been presented for low levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), a class of contaminants of emerging concern, in grocery store fish. We examined the effectiveness of three cooking methods (i.e., baking, broiling, and frying) on reducing PFAS levels in four sport fish species. Samples of Chinook salmon, common carp, lake trout and walleye were collected from four rivers in Ontario, Canada and skin-off fillets were analyzed for regular groups of PFASs such as perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), as well as perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acids (PFPAs), perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (PFPIAs) and polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diesters (diPAPs), which are PFASs of emerging concern. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFAS detected and the concentrations were more than an order of magnitude higher than those reported for fish from grocery stores in Canada, Spain, and China. Although concentrations of PFOS in fish fillets generally increase after cooking, amounts of PFOS largely remain unchanged. Relatively minor differences in changes in the fish PFAS amounts after cooking depended on fish species and cooking method used. We conclude that cooking sport fish is generally not an effective approach to reduce dietary exposure to PFASs, especially PFOS. © 2014.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2014.01.024,Fish;PFOS;Animals;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Canada;Meat;Food Contamination;China;Environmental Exposure;Spain;body mass;environmental exposure;nonhuman;unclassified drug;comparative study;dietary intake;alkyl group;animal tissue;Muscle;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;sulfonate;sulfonic acid derivative;Emerging contaminant;article;carboxylic acid;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;priority journal;chemical analysis;Organic chemicals;pollution effect;Ontario [Canada];Great Lakes;Great Lakes [North America];food consumption;cooking;Cooking;food processing;frying;health risk;carp;tissue level;public health;Fishes;concentration (parameters);perfluoroalkyl;Impurities;perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid;organophosphorus compound;Organic Chemicals;trout;Fish consumption;Water Pollutants;intermethod comparison;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha;Chemical;Skeletal;polyfluoroalkyl;perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acid;contaminated fish;Great lakes;perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acid;polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diester;baking;broiling;canola oil;comparative effectiveness;divergent strabismus;SportS;walleye fish,NA,NA

Uncontrolled inputs combined with poor environmental management often result in elevated levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in affected estuaries. Data on POPs research from 1960 to 2020 were analysed in terms of their sources, environmental investigations, and health implications. The outcome showed polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) to exceed the US EPA health advisory levels for drinking water. Concentration of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in water were below the WHO limits, while those in fish tissues from most estuaries were found to be below the US FDA limits. Although environmental compartments in some estuaries (e.g. Rooiels and uMngeni estuaries) seem to be less contaminated relative to other marine systems around the world, many others were polluted and critically modified (e.g. Durban Bay, Swartkops, Sundays, and Buffalo systems). Due to inconsistent monitoring methods coupled with limited data availability, temporal trends were unclear. Of the 290 estuaries in South Africa, 65 were prioritised and recommended for POPs evaluation based on their pollution sources, and a monitoring strategy was defined in terms of sampling. Government policies to curb marine pollution need to be enforced to prevent chronic contamination that leads to water quality deterioration and loss of ecosystem services. © 2021 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112316,Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Pesticides;Environmental Exposure;United States;Hydrocarbons;South Africa;animal;concentration (parameter);ecosystem;Ecosystem;environmental chemical;environmental exposure;unclassified drug;polychlorinated biphenyl;environmental monitoring;persistent organic pollutant;Persistent Organic Pollutants;water pollutant;chlorinated hydrocarbon;environmental management;Environmental management;marine environment;pollution exposure;water pollution;procedures;PCB;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;pesticide;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;reference value;drinking water;water contamination;trend study;organochlorine pesticide;plastic;Plastics;Estuaries;estuary;PBDE;PAH;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons;polychlorinated biphenyl derivative;environmental protection;environmental policy;Eastern Cape;Water Pollutants;water quality;Chemical;outcome assessment;Chlorinated;government regulation;estuarine pollution;Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs);agricultural runoff;Durban Harbour;Estuarine systems;KwaZulu-Natal;Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs);polybrominated biphenyl derivative;Polybrominated diphenyls (PBDEs);Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs);sewage outfall;Sundays Estuary;World Health Organization,NA,NA

To date, legacy PFAS have been well studied; however, the concentration of alternative PFAS may exceed the concentration of legacy pollutants, and more information is needed regarding the sublethal toxicity at the molecular level of aquatic model organisms, such as Daphnia magna. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) are four widely detected PFAS alternatives of varying chain length and polar functionality that are quantified in aquatic environments. The present study examines the metabolic perturbations of PFAS with varying chemistries to D. magna using targeted mass spectrometry–based metabolomics. Daphnia were acutely exposed to sublethal concentrations of PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, and PFNA before the polar metabolite profile was extracted from single organisms. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant separation between the sublethal concentrations of PFHxA, PFHxS, and PFNA relative to the controls; in sum, longer chain lengths demonstrated greater overall perturbations to the extracted metabolic profiles. Univariate statistics revealed significant perturbations in the concentrations of several amino acids, nucleotides/nucleosides, and neurotransmitters with exposure to PFAS. These metabolic perturbations are consistent with disruptions in energy metabolism (pantothenate and coenzyme A metabolism, histidine metabolism) and protein synthesis (aminoacyl-transfer RNA biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism), which were identified through biochemical pathway analysis. These results provide evidence that although PFAS chemistry (chain length and polar functional group) invokes unique metabolic responses, there is also an underlying toxic mode of action that is common with select PFAS exposure. Overall, the present study highlights the capabilities of environmental metabolomics to elucidate the molecular-level perturbations of pollutants within the same chemical class to model aquatic organisms, which can be used to prioritize risk assessment of substituted PFAS alternatives.

Biomarkers involved in xenobiotic-mediated responses were individually contrasted in fish of both species and 17 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) analysed in muscle to reveal bioaccumulation trends. The parameters were in muscle: cholinesterases, metabolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate synthase (CS); and in liver: cytochrome P450 dependent activities (EROD and BFCOD), carboxylesterase (CE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT). All markers are considered adaptive defence mechanism to face stress. Sensitivity to a model pesticide: dichlorvos was also contrasted in vitro in muscular acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and hepatic CE to reveal species sensitivity to neurotoxic chemicals. Enzymatic activities related to protective mechanisms such as butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), CE and CAT were higher in chub whereas the antioxidant defences GR and GPX were higher in barbel. Aerobic CS was also higher in barbel while anaerobic LDH was so in chub. EROD activity did not differ between the two species but BFCOD activity was higher in barbel. Levels of PFAS were higher in barbel likely due to its benthic habitat. The in vitro tests revealed higher sensitivity to dichlorvos of muscular AChE in chub (lower IC50) which was probably compensated by a higher catalytic efficiency of CE. All these former biochemical particularities are discussed in terms of fish ecological performance in front of anthropogenic stressors. © 2020",NA,10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.108940,Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;animal;ecosystem;Ecosystem;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;comparative study;controlled study;bioaccumulation;biological marker;animal tissue;in vitro study;perfluoroalkanoic acid;water pollutant;Biomarkers;Mediterranean Sea;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;toxicity;drug effect;muscle;muscle tissue;liver;pathology;pesticide;priority journal;Insecticides;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluorodecane sulfonate;perfluoroheptanoic acid;perfluoropentanoic acid;perfluorotetradecanoic acid;metabolism;neurotoxicity;perfluorobutane sulfonate;perfluorobutanoic acid;biochemical analysis;catalase;glutathione transferase;cytochrome P450;enzyme activity;ethoxyresorufin deethylase;insecticide;perfluorohexadecanoic acid;perfluorooctadecanoic acid;lactate dehydrogenase;Muscles;glutathione peroxidase;Glutathione Transferase;reactive oxygen metabolite;biometry;Water Pollutants;Southern Europe;Catalase;Chemical;Cyprinidae;acetylcholinesterase;cholinesterase;Barbus meridionalis;Baseline activities;carboxylesterase;Catalan chub;catalytic efficiency;citrate synthase;dichlorvos;Dichlorvos;Endemic fish;Glutathione Peroxidase;glutathione reductase;Glutathione Reductase;kinetic parameters;Mediterranean barbel;Mediterranean Region;Squalius laietanus,NA,NA

This study systematically investigated the translocation of 13 PFAAs under different iron and nitrogen fertilization conditions in a wheat-soil ecosystem. Short-chain PFAAs including PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, and PFBS mostly accumulated in soil solution (10.43-55.33%) and soluble extracellular polymeric substances (S-EPS) (11.39-14.77%) by the adsorption to amino- (−NH2) and hydroxyl (−OH) groups in dissolved organic matter (DOM). Other PFAAs with longer carbon chain lengths were mostly distributed on the soil particle surface by hydrophobic actions (74.63-94.24%). Iron-nitrogen amendments triggered (p < 0.05) soil iron-nitrogen cycling, rhizospheric reactive oxygen species fluctuations, and the concentration increases of −NH2 and −OH in the DOM structure. Thus, the accumulation capacity of PFAAs in soil solution and root EPS was increased. In sum, PFAAs’ translocation from soil particles to wheat root was synergistically reduced by iron and nitrogen fertilization through increased adsorption of soil particles (p < 0.05) and the retention of soil solution and root EPSs. This study highlights the potential of iron-nitrogen amendments in decreasing the crop ecological risks to PFAAs’ pollution. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.3c04788,Perfluoroalkyl acids;Fluorocarbons;Article;concentration (parameter);ecosystem;Ecosystem;Ecosystems;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;nitrogen;chemistry;hydrophobicity;Triticum;wheat;perfluorohexanoic acid;Risk assessment;adsorption;soil;organofluorine derivative;Soil;soil pollution;Soil pollution;chemical structure;polymerization;environmental impact;Organic compounds;perfluorobutyric acid;agricultural soil;reactive oxygen metabolite;reactive oxygen species;Biogeochemistry;dissolved organic matter;Dissolved organic matters;iron;Dissolution;Nitrogen;amine;pollution control;plant root;Crops;Iron;translocation;rhizosphere;hydroxyl group;Extracellular;perfluoroalkyl acids;nitrogen cycle;biofilm matrix;Dissolved Organic Matter;dissolved organic matters;Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix;geochemistry;Iron nitrogen;iron−nitrogen amendment;Iron−nitrogen amendment;nitrogen cycling;perfluorobutylsulfonate;perfluorovaleric acid;Polymeric substance;Root extracellular polymeric substance;root extracellular polymeric substances;soil amendment;Soil ecosystems;Soil moisture;Soil particles;soil solution;Soil solutions;Oxalic Acid;Polymers;Polymerization,NA,NA

We also found evidence of thyroid hormone (TH) pathway interference at multiple levels of biological organization (i.e., somatic growth, messenger RNA expression, and circulating free thyroxine levels). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PFHxS exposure interferes with TH-dependent neurodevelopmental pathways. This study investigates global transcriptional profiles in cerebral hemispheres of chicken embryos following exposure to a solvent control, 890 or 38,000ng PFHxS/g egg (n = 4-5 per group); doses that lead to the adverse effects indicated above. PFHxS significantly alters the expression (≥ 1.5-fold, p ≤ 0.001) of 11 transcripts at the low dose (890ng/g) and 101 transcripts at the high dose (38,000ng/g). Functional enrichment analysis shows that PFHxS affects genes involved in tissue development and morphology, cellular assembly and organization, and cell-to-cell signaling. Pathway and interactome analyses suggest that genes may be affected through several potential regulatory molecules, including integrin receptors, myelocytomatosis viral oncogene, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. This study identifies key functional and regulatory modes of PFHxS action involving TH-dependent and -independent neurodevelopmental pathways. Some of these TH-dependent mechanisms that occur during embryonic development include tight junction formation, signal transduction, and integrin signaling, whereas TH-independent mechanisms include gap junction intercellular communication. © The Author 2012.

The dissociated anionic conjugate bases of PFCAs have negligible air-water partition coefficients (KAWs) and do not volatilize from water. The neutral acids, however, have relatively high KAWs and volatilization from water has been demonstrated. The extent of volatilization of PFCAs in the environment will depend on the water pH and their pKa. Knowledge of the pKas of PFCAs is therefore vital for understanding their environmental transport and fate. We investigated the water-to-air transfer of PFCAs in a novel experimental setup. We used ∼1 μg L -1 of PFCAs in water (above environmental background concentrations but below the concentration at which self-association occurs) at different water pH (pH 0.3 to pH 6.9) and sampled the PFCAs volatilized from water during a 2-day experiment. Our results suggest that the pKas of C 4-11 PFCAs are <1.6. For PFOA, we derived a pKa of 0.5 from fitting the experimental measurements with a volatilization model.

In this study, the uptake, translocation and transformation of 6:2 and 8:2 diPAP in wheat using hydroponic experiments were investigated. 6:2 diPAP was more easily taken up by roots and translocated to shoots than 8:2 diPAP. Their phase I metabolites were fluorotelomer saturated carboxylates (FTCAs), fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylates (FTUCAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFCAs with even-numbered chain length were the primary phase I terminal metabolites suggesting that they were mainly generated through β-oxidation. Cysteine and sulfate conjugates were the primary phase II transformation metabolites. The higher levels and ratios of phase II metabolites in the 6:2 diPAP exposure group indicated that the phase I metabolites of 6:2 diPAP were more susceptible to phase II transformation than that of 8:2 diPAP, which was confirmed by density functional theory calculation. Enzyme activity analyses and in vitro experiments demonstrated that cytochrome P450 and alcohol dehydrogenase actively participated in the phase Ⅰ transformation of diPAPs.

They are prone to accumulate in organisms and have raised public attention in recent decades. Feather samples have been successfully applied as nondestructive indicators for several contaminants. However, a sophisticated analytical method for determining PFAAs in feathers is still lacking. In the present study, a series of conditions, such as the use of the solid-phase extraction cartridge type and extraction/digestion methods, were optimized for the analysis of 13 PFAAs in feathers. According to the spiked recoveries, a weak-anion exchange cartridge was chosen and the methanol was selected as the extraction solvent. In the present study, an optimized pretreatment procedure combined with high-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC–ESI–MS/MS) method was established for the determination of PFAAs in feathers. The recoveries and method detection limits of the PFAAs ranged from 71 to 120% and 0.16 to 0.54 ng/g, respectively. Finally, 13 PFAAs in four accipiter feather samples from Nam Co Basin, Tibetan Plateau, were analyzed, indicating that PFOS was the predominant PFAA in accipiter feathers, with an average of 4.67 ng/g, followed by the short-chain PFAAs, PFBS and PFBA, with averages of 1.91 and 1.39 ng/g, respectively.

Regulatory actions have curbed production of legacy compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), but impacts of regulations on PFAS releases to the marine environment are poorly understood. Here, we report new data for 21 targeted PFAS in seawater and plankton from the coast, shelf, and slope of the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean. We find strong inverse correlations between salinity and concentrations of most PFAS, indicating that ongoing continental discharges are the major source to the marine environment. For legacy PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, a comparison of inland and offshore measurements from the same year (2014) suggests that there are ongoing releases to the marine environment from sources such as submarine groundwater discharges. Vertical transport of most PFAS associated with settling particles from the surface (10 m) to deeper waters is small compared to advective transport except for perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA; 35% of vertical flux) and precursor compounds to PFOS (up to 86%). We find higher than expected bioaccumulation factors (BAFs = Cplankton/Cwater) for perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with five and six carbons (log BAF = 2.9-3.4) and linear PFOS (log BAF = 2.6-4.3) in marine plankton compared to PFCAs with 7-11 carbons. We postulate that this reflects additional contributions from precursor compounds. Known precursor compounds detected here have among the highest BAFs (log BAF > 3.0) for all PFAS in this study, suggesting that additional research on the bioaccumulation potential of unknown organofluorine compounds is urgently needed.

In the past decade, these emerging organohalides (EOHs) have been extensively produced as industrial and consumer products, resulting in their widespread environmental distribution. This review comprehensively summarizes the environmental occurrence and remediation methods for typical EOHs. Based on the data collected from 2015 to 2021, these EOHs are widespread in both abiotic (e.g., dust, air, soil, sediment, and water) and biotic (e.g., bird, fish, and human serum) matrices. A significant positive correlation was found between the estimated annual production amounts of EOHs and their environmental contamination levels, suggesting the prohibition of both production and usage of EOHs as a critical pollution-source control strategy. The strengths and weaknesses, as well as the future prospects of up-to-date remediation techniques, such as photodegradation, chemical oxidation, and biodegradation, are critically discussed. Of these remediation techniques, microbial reductive dehalogenation represents a promising in situ remediation method for removal of EOHs, such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118060,Humans;PFASs;POPs;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers;animal;concentration (parameter);nonhuman;unclassified drug;bird;halogen;hexabromocyclododecane;Organic pollutants;organohalogen derivative;polychlorinated biphenyl;tetrabromobisphenol A;contamination;environmental monitoring;persistent organic pollutant;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;fish;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;flame retardant;Flame retardants;Flame Retardants;paraffin;Paraffin;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;human;remediation;serum;soil;water;diphenyl ether derivative;POP;perfluorononanoic acid;decabromodiphenyl ethane;dechlorane plus;sediment;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;molecular weight;Consumer products;halide;LD50;biodegradation;dust;perfluorobutyric acid;physical chemistry;bioremediation;vapor pressure;Halogenated flame retardant;abiotic factor;hexabromobenzene;pentabromoethylbenzene;triclosan;Decabromodiphenyl ethane;air;Biodegradation;4;1;1 (1;2 bis (2;2 dibromoethyl) 3;2 ethylhexyl 2;3;3 dichloroisopropyl)phosphate;4 dibrom ocyclohexane;5 tetrabromobenzoic acid;6 tribromophenoxy)ethane;alkaline hydrothermal reaction;biotic factor;bis(2 ethylhexyl)tetrabromophthalate;bisphenol A hexafluoride;boiling point;chemical degradation;chemical oxidation;electrochemical degradation;Emerging organohalide;Environmental occurrence;Environmental remediation;medium chain chlorinated paraffin;melting point;microbial reductive dehalogenation;molecular formula;nanoscale zero valent iron reduction;Organohalides;ozonation;pentabromotoluene;photodegradation;pollution control;Polybrominated diphenylethers;Remediation;Remediation methods;short chain chlorinated paraffin;sonochemical degradation;tris(1;tris(1 chloro 2 propyl)phosphate;water solubility;Dehalogenation;Emerging organohalides;HFRs,NA,NA

Human and wildlife exposure to PFAS is widespread. Increasing evidence suggests adverse effects of PFAS to human health and the environment. Human health risks from exposure through drinking water and fish consumption are areas of concern. Therefore, understanding occurrence and exposure risk is important to protect water resources. PFAS was investigated in fish fillet from the Delaware River over a 15-y period (2004–2018). The sample period coincided with actions to reduce or eliminate the release of certain PFAS to the environment. Elevated levels of perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnA) were initially observed in tidal fish fillet. While significant decreases in PFNA and PFUnA concentrations were observed in fish fillet from the tidal river during the timeframe of the study, changes in concentrations of other PFAS in tidal and nontidal fish were less substantial. In 2018, fish fillet continued to be contaminated with perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) at levels exceeding recommended regional risk advisory limits on fish consumption.

Herein, we integrated metabolomics and proteomics analysis to investigate the altered profiles in metabolite and protein levels in primary human hepatocytes (PHH) exposed to 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS at human exposure relevant concentrations. Our results showed that 6:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited higher perturbation effects on cell viability, metabolome and proteome than PFOS. Integration of metabolomics and proteomics revealed that the alteration of glycerophospholipid metabolism was the critical pathway of 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS-induced lipid metabolism disorder in primary human hepatocytes. Interestingly, 6:2 Cl-PFESA-induced cellular metabolic process disorder was associated with the cellular membrane-bounded signaling pathway, while PFOS was associated with the intracellular transport process. Moreover, the disruption effects of 6:2 Cl-PFESA were also involved in inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling system.

Forty-five percent of the farm-associated (FA) fish (60% of the saithe and 30% of the cod) and none of the control fish had salmon feed (aquaculture food pellets) in their digestive tracts. Concentrations of OCs and BFRs were about 50% higher and dominated more by persistent compounds in Atlantic cod compared to saithe. After controlling for a set of confounding variables (location, sex, size, weight, gonads size, hepatosomatic index, and % lipids in the liver), the concentrations of -OC and -BDE were 50% higher in FA cod compared to control fish, whereas they were 20% higher in FA saithe than control fish. Hence, salmon farms are a source of lipid-soluble OHCs to wild marine fish, but variation in life-history and habitat use seems to affect the levels of OHCs in the different fish species. In contrast to the lipid-soluble OHCs, control fish had 67% higher PFOS levels than FA fish, which suggests that natural food contains higher loads of this compound than the commercial feed used in salmon farms. Some OHCs are known to act as endocrine disruptors, thus further work is required to determine if OHCs negatively affect reproductive processes of wild fish associated with salmon farms. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/es102195d,Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Organochlorines;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Norway;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Sulfur compounds;Liver;Pesticides;Ethers;Hydrocarbons;Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers;Male;nonhuman;controlled study;hexabromocyclododecane;polybrominated diphenyl ether;polychlorinated biphenyl;lipid;fish;organohalogen;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;flame retardant;Flame retardants;Flame Retardants;Polychlorinated biphenyls;pesticide;article;Persistent compounds;pollution effect;endocrine disruptor;organochlorine pesticide;Chemical contamination;Polybrominated diphenyl ethers;Seawater;contaminated animal;geography;Brominated flame retardants;wild population;Brominated;concentration (parameters);Endocrine disruptor;agricultural land;Farms;lipid solubility;aquaculture;life history;functional morphology;Salmon;salmonid;Water Pollutants;Hexabromocyclododecanes;sex ratio;weight;habitat use;gonad;Chemical;Halogenated;sex;Atlantic cod;Gadus morhua;body size;Aquaculture;Fish species;Gadiformes;Digestive system;Marine fish;Pollachius virens;Life history;commercial activity;Commercial feed;Control sites;Digestive tract;Habitat use;Hepatosomatic indices;Higher loads;Natural food;Salmon feed,NA,NA

Concentrations of PFAAs, especially perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in various environmental media including water, sediment, soil, rain, snow and organisms, as well as human tissues are summarized based on the available data. Concentrations of PFAAs in aquatic systems are higher in relatively more industrialized and urbanized areas than those from the less populated and remote regions in China, indicating that their emission and distribution are closely related to regional urbanization and industrialization. PFAAs and related products have been widely used over the past several decades, which have brought about high concentrations detected in environmental matrixes, biota and even local residents. Ecological risk assessment of PFAAs is still less developed in China. Most existing studies compared concentrations of PFAAs to guideline values derived for single species to evaluate the risk. In order to reveal the transport, partitioning and degradation of PFAAs in the environment, further studies on their behavior, fate, bioaccumulation and adverse effects in different trophic levels should be conducted.

The structural analog, 8-2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8-2 fTOH) is considered the probable precursor of these stable metabolites. Because simultaneous quantification is needed for volatile and non-volatile perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) in complex matrices, a GC/MS method was developed and tested based on selected ion monitoring of perfluorinated alkyl parent chain fragment ions. Although the method requires a derivatization step, combined GC/MS analysis of PFCA-me's and FTOHs increases analytical efficiency and decreases sample analysis time. The method instrument detection limits are between 7.1 and 24.5 ng/mL extract (MTBE), and the method quantification limits are below 50 ng/mL serum or ng/g liver for all PFCs investigated. Recoveries from mouse serum and liver homogenates, which were spiked with FTOHs and PFCAs at levels of 25 and 200 ng/mL or ng/g, ranged from 81 to 101%. Finally, the utility of the method was demonstrated by dosing male CD-1 mice with 30 mg/kg-BW of 8-2 fTOH and quantifying PFCs 6 h post-treatment. The advantages of this method are (1) the simultaneous detection of both volatile and non-volatile fluorotelomer-based chemicals in complex matrices, such as mammalian tissues, (2) as a confirmatory method to LC-MS/MS, and (3) as an alternative method of analysis for laboratories without access to LC-MS/MS. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The main tributary, the Vaal River on the eastern side of the basin drains a large industrial region before it confluences with the Orange-Senqu River. The Orange-Senqu River with its origin in Lesotho flows west providing irrigation water for agricultural activities. It confluences with the Vaal River near Douglas before continuing westwards, flowing past mining, rural, and agricultural activities, discharging into the Atlantic Ocean. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are omnipresent in the environment and concerns about the pollution in the OSRB prompted several surveys. Two matrices, an abiotic and a biotic matrix were selected to investigate the pollution in the basin. Due to their physical and chemical properties, POPs bioaccumulate in higher trophic level species. Bird eggs were selected as a biotic matrix since birds inhabit many niches and trophic levels. In Chapter 2, I review the Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) as a suitable near-global indicator of terrestrial pollution. It is the most wide-spread Ardeid with an extensive natural expansion, occurring in high numbers and breed in colonies with other Ardeids.

PFCAs at high doses are known to regulate xenobiotic transporters partly through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in rodentmodels. Less is known regarding how various PFCAs at a lower concentration modulate transporters for endogenous substrates, such as amino acids in human hepatocytes. Such studies are of particular importance because amino acids are involved in chemical detoxification, and their transport system may serve as a promising therapeutic target for structurally similar xenobiotics. The focus of this study was to further elucidate how PFCAs modulate transporters involved in intermediary metabolism and xenobiotic biotransformation. We tested the hepatic transcriptomic response of HepaRGcells exposed to 45 lMofperfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, or perfluorodecanoic acid in triplicates for 24 hours (vehicle: 0.1% DMSO), as well as the prototypical ligands for PPARa (WY-14643, 45 lM) and CAR (6-(4-chlorophenyl) imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime [CITCO], 2 lM). PFCAs with increasing carbon chain lengths (C8-C10) regulated more liver genes, with amino acid metabolism and transport ranked among the top enriched pathways and PFDA ranked as themost potent PFCA tested. Genes encoding amino acid transporters, which are essential for protein synthesis, were novel inducible targets by all three PFCAs, suggesting a potentially protective mechanism to reduce further toxic insults. None of the transporter regulations appeared to be through PPARa or CAR but potential involvement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 is noted for all 3 PFCAs. In conclusion, PFCAs with increasing carbon chain lengths up-regulate amino acid transporters andmodulate xenobiotic transporters to limit further toxic exposures in HepaRGcells. © 2022 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.",NA,10.1124/dmd.121.000477,Humans;exposure;Article;Carboxylic Acids;nonhuman;unclassified drug;carbon;Carbon;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;principal component analysis;genetics;toxicity;liver;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha;PPAR alpha;human;carboxylic acid;perfluorononanoic acid;metabolism;perfluorinated carboxylic acid;transcription factor Nrf2;upregulation;amino acid;biotransformation;human cell;gene expression regulation;transcriptomics;genetic association;liver cell;xenobiotic agent;Xenobiotics;concentration response;dimethyl sulfoxide;pirinixic acid;Amino Acids;protein synthesis;ligand binding;amino acid metabolism;RNA sequence;Dimethyl Sulfoxide;[6 (4 chlorophenyl)imidazo[2;1 b][1;3]thiazole 5 carbaldehyde o (3;4 dichlorobenzyl)oxime];Amino Acid Transport Systems;amino acid transporter;carbon chain length;gene activation;mitochondrial permeability;oxime;Oximes;thiazole derivative;Thiazoles;xenobiotic transporter,NA,NA

Here, we have evaluated the adsorption/desorption behaviour of marker polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), onto MPL surfaces of three widely used polymers-polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The range of MPL sizes ranged from 1 to 600 mu m. The adsorption/desorption was evaluated in sediment/water systems in marine microcosms emulating realistic environmental conditions for 21 days. The adsorption percentages ranged from 20 to 60%. PCBs with a lower degree of chlorination showed higher adsorption percentages because of conformational impediments of PCBs with high-degree chlorination, and also by their affinity to be adsorbed in sediments. Glassy plastic polymers as PET and PS showed a superior affinity for PCBs than rubbery polymers, such as PE. The polymers that can bond PCBs by pi-pi interactions, rather than van der Waals forces showed better adsorption percentages, as expected. Finally, the adsorption/desorption behaviour of selected PCBs onto MPLs was fitted to a Freundlich isotherm model, with correlations higher than 0.8 in most of the cases.",NA,10.3390/toxics8030059,Adsorption,NA,NA

To understand the associated risks, the occurrence of PFAS in human milk and the toxicokinetics of PFAS in infants need to be addressed. OBJECTIVES: We determined levels of emerging and legacy PFAS in human milk and urine samples from Chinese breastfed infants, estimated renal clearance, and predicted infant serum PFAS levels. METHODS: In total, human milk samples were collected from 1,151 lactating mothers in 21 cities in China. In addition, 80 paired infant cord blood and urine samples were obtained from two cities. Nine emerging PFAS and 13 legacy PFAS were analyzed in the samples using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Renal clearance rates (CLrenal s) of PFAS were estimated in the paired samples. PFAS serum concentrations in infants (<1 year of age) were predicted using a first-order pharmacokinetic model. RESULTS: All nine emerging PFAS were detected in human milk, with the detection rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA, PFMOAA, and PFO5DoDA all exceeding 70%. The level of 6:2 Cl-PFESA in human milk (median concentration = 13:6 ng/L) ranked third after PFOA (336 ng/L) and PFOS (49:7 ng/L). The estimated daily intake (EDI) values of PFOA and PFOS exceeded the reference dose (RfD) of 20 ng/kg BW per day recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 78% and 17% of breastfed infant samples, respectively. 6:2 Cl-PFESA had the lowest infant CLrenal (0:009 mL/kg BW per day), corresponding to the longest estimated half-life of 49 y. The average half-lives of PFMOAA, PFO2HxA, and PFO3OA were 0.221, 0.075, and 0.304 y, respectively. The CLrenal s of PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA were slower in infants than in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the widespread occurrence of emerging PFAS in human milk in China. The relatively high EDIs and half-lives of emerging PFAS suggest potential health risks of postnatal exposure in newborns. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Several studies have revealed the potential toxicity of PFBS in animals. PFBS can be taken up and accumulate in plants; however, whether and how PFBS affects plant growth remain largely unclear. A low concentration of PFBS did not affect plant growth, indicating that it had higher environmental safety than other perfluorinated compounds; however, a high concentration of PFBS (>1 mM) markedly inhibited primary root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. Subsequently, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth mediated by high concentrations of PFBS. First, a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis revealed that PFBS altered the expression of genes associated with phytohormone signaling pathways. Combining physio-biochemical and genetic analyses, we next demonstrated that PFBS reduced the contents of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA), and disrupted the two signaling pathways in plants, finally inhibiting root growth. Moreover, a high concentration of PFBS also inhibited photosynthesis by comprehensively repressing the expression of genes related to the Calvin cycle and the photosynthetic apparatus. Such an understanding is helpful for elucidating the phytotoxicity of PFBS and provides a new strategy for toxicology research on organic pollutants in plants. © 2022 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107646,Article;Genes;nonhuman;unclassified drug;Organic pollutants;perfluoro compound;gene expression;phytotoxicity;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;perfluorobutane sulfonate;polymerase chain reaction;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;biochemical analysis;genetic analysis;perflubutane;molecular analysis;environmental risk;spectrofluorometry;Plants (botany);photosynthesis;plant growth;Environmental risks;Arabidopsis thaliana;growth inhibition;Photosynthesis;Signaling;Sulphonates;chlorophyll;fluorescence microscopy;Perfluorobutane;Environmental risk;abscisic acid;auxin;carbon dioxide fixation;cell cycle progression;chlorophyll fluorescence;Genetic analysis;genome-wide association study;indoleacetic acid;Perfluorobutane sulfonate;Perfluorobutane sulphonate;phytohormone;Phytohormone signaling pathway;Phytohormone signaling pathways;Plant growth;Primary root growth;Primary root growths;root growth;signaling pathway analysis;Signalling pathways;Sulfones;Molecular Biology,NA,NA

Previous studies comparing their toxicity generally used similar exposure levels, without taking internal concentrations into account. The current study compared the reproductive toxicity of PFOS and PFBS, at similar internal concentrations, to Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). PFBS was much less bioaccumulative than PFOS. The 48-h median lethal concentrations (LC50) for PFOS and PFBS were 1.4 μM (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1–1.6) and 794 μM (95% CI: 624–1009), respectively. Egg production and brood number of C. elegans decreased markedly following exposure to 0.1 μM PFOS or 1000 or 1500 μM PFBS. Germ-cell apoptosis and production of reactive oxygen species increased significantly following exposure to 2 μM PFOS or 500 or 1000 μM PFBS. Expression of the antioxidant genes sod-3, ctl-2, and gst-4 and the pro-apoptotic genes egl-1 and ced-13 was altered significantly following PFOS and PFBS exposure. These findings indicate that both chemicals exert reproductive toxicity in C. elegans, probably owing to germ-cell apoptosis resulting from elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. The vastly different exposure concentrations of PFBS and PFOS used in this study produced similar internal concentrations, leading to the reproductive toxicities observed. © 2018",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.04.032,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;unclassified drug;controlled study;bioaccumulation;chemical compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;reproductive behavior;gene;gene expression;sulfonate;sulfonic acid derivative;drug effect;ecotoxicology;egg production;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;reproductive toxicity;pollution effect;metabolism;perfluorobutane sulfonate;LC50;LD50;perflubutane;toxic concentration;apoptosis;Apoptosis;reactive oxygen metabolite;Reactive Oxygen Species;Lethal Dose 50;biosynthesis;Caenorhabditis elegans;nematode;Perfluorobutane sulfonate;Reproductive toxicity;brood parasite;ced 13 gene;ctl 2 gene;egl 1 gene;extracellular superoxide dismutase;germ cell;gst 4 gene;sod 3 gene;Sulfones,NA,NA

In this study, the concentrations of 13 PFASs (8 perfluorocarboxylic acids, 3 perfluoroalkane sulfonates, and 2 intermediates) in wastewater and sludge from 81 WWTPs in South Korea were collected. The emission pathways of PFASs were redefined, and then the national emission of PFASs from WWTPs was rigorously updated. In addition to the direct calculations, Monte Carlo simulations were also used to calculate the likely range of PFAS emissions. The total (Σ13PFAS) emission (wastewater + sludge) calculated from the direct calculation with mean concentrations was 4.03 ton/y. The emissions of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, 1.19 ton/y) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, 1.01 ton/y) were dominant. The Monte Carlo simulations suggested that the realistic national emission of Σ13PFASs is between 2 ton/y and 20 ton/y. Combined WWTPs treating municipal wastewater from residential and commercial areas were identified as a major emission source, contributing 65% to the total PFAS emissions. The Han and Nakdong Rivers were the primary contaminated rivers, receiving 89% of the total PFAS discharge from WWTPs.

PFASs can compete with thyroxine (T4) for binding to the human thyroid hormone transport protein transthyretin (TTR) which may lead to reduce thyroid hormone levels leading to endocrine disrupting adverse effects. Environmental fate and endocrine-disrupting activity of PFASs has initiated several research projects, but the amount of experimental data available for these pollutants is limited. In this study, experimental data for T4-TTR competing potency of 24 PFASs obtained in a radioligand-binding assay were modeled using classification- and regression-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) tools with simple molecular descriptors obtained from chemical structure of these compounds in order to identify the responsible structural features and fragments of the studied PFASs for endocrine disruption activity. Additionally, docking studies were performed employing the crystal structure complex of TTR with bound 2′, 6′-difluorobiphenyl-4-carboxylic acid (PDB: 2F7I) in order to constitute the receptor model for human TTR. The results corroborate evidence for these binding interactions and indicate multiple high-affinity modes of binding. The developed in silico models therefore advance our understanding of important structural attributes of these chemicals and may provide important information for the design of future synthesis of PFASs as well as may serve as an efficient query tool for virtual screening of large PFAS databases to check their endocrine toxicity profile. © 2017",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.024,Pollution;Humans;PFASs;chemical pollutant;Article;Thyroid Hormones;Hydrocarbons;Hormones;thyroid hormone;Thyroid hormones;thyroxine;Thyroxine;unclassified drug;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;Binding energy;chemistry;computer simulation;hydrogen bond;hydrophobicity;in vitro study;molecular docking;perfluoro compound;protein;chemical compound;toxicity;Toxicity;environmental fate;human;polyfluoroalkyl substance;metabolism;endocrine disruptor;Endocrine Disruptors;hormone;chemical structure;Diagnosis;environmental impact;Endocrine disrupters;Proteins;bioinformatics;fluorinated hydrocarbon;Docking;Thyroid hormone;prealbumin;Endocrine disruption;discriminant analysis;assay;ligand;Ligands;binding site;quantitative structure activity relation;Computer Simulation;Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship;Fluorinated;crystal structure;atom;Computational chemistry;QSAR;Crystal structure;modeling;Prealbumin;receptor binding assay;Transport protein transthyretin;Transthyretin,NA,NA

Sorption experiments with perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) suggest that their sorption can be described reasonably well as a partitioning-like process with an average log K<sub>oc</sub> of approximately 2.8 for PFOA and 3.0 for PFOS. However, median concentrations in sediments (PFOA, 0.27ngg<sup>−1</sup>; PFOS, 0.54ngg<sup>−1</sup>) or sewage sludge (PFOA, 37ngg<sup>−1</sup>; PFOS, 69ngg<sup>−1</sup>) in relation to median concentrations in surface water (PFOA, 3ngl<sup>−1</sup>; PFOS, 3ngl<sup>−1</sup>) or wastewater treatment effluent (PFOA, 24ngl<sup>−1</sup>; PFOS, 11ngl<sup>−1</sup>), suggest that effective log K<sub>oc</sub> distribution coefficients for the field situation may be close to 3.7 for PFOA and 4.2 for PFOS. Applying lab-based log K<sub>oc</sub> distribution coefficients can therefore result in a serious overestimation of PFC concentrations in water and in turn to an underestimation of the residence time of PFOA and PFOS in contaminated soils. Irrespective of the dissipation kinetics, the majority of PFOA and PFOS from contaminated soils will be transported to groundwater and surface water bodies.",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.02.024,Perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;Wastewater treatment;Sediments;Sorption;Partition coefficient (Chemistry);Literature reviews;Soil chemistry,NA,NA

However, the environmental behaviors of emerging PFASs is largely unknown in Daling River, Northern China. In this study, the potential sources, sediment-water partitioning and substitution trends of PFASs were investigated in overlying water and sediments from Daling River and its estuary. Perfluorooctane sulfonate and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid were major compounds, and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate was first detected. Firefighting foam manufacturing and fluoropolymer production were the main sources of PFASs. Compared to legacy PFASs (C8), the emerging PFASs (C6 - C9) were more incline to distribute into overlying water.

In this study, the fate of EXLYM in aqueous solutions was investigated using experimental and theoretical approaches. Laboratory-scale experiments showed that EXLYM is hydrolytically stable. Microbial processes are primarily responsible for the oxidation of sulfur in aqueous solutions. Under simulated sunlight, the t(1/2) values of EXLYM in acidic, neutral, and alkaline buffer solutions were 5.02, 3.83, and 5.55 h, respectively.

The magnetic Fe3O4-TiO2 material was used as magnetic separation medium and purification adsorbent to remove proteins. This facilitated rapid phase separation and enabled the extraction and purification processes to be completed in a single step within 5 min. Key factors of the integrated QuEChERS method, including the extraction solution, salting-out and dehydrating reagents, and purification adsorbents, were optimized to ensure effective recovery of PFAS and the elimination of matrix interferences. Under these optimized conditions, systematic method validation exhibited good linearity (R2 > 0.9931). The method limit of detection ranged from 0.010 to 0.048 μg/kg, and the method limit of quantitation ranged from 0.025 to 0.050 μg/kg. The PFAS recoveries varied from 71.3 % to 116.3 % at spiked concentrations of 0.025, 0.05, 10 and 100 μg/kg, with intra-day RSDs and inter-day RSDs below 11.8 % and 9.0 %, respectively.

Here, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of exposure to chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs) and legacy PFASs and the relative contribution from different external pathways to human exposure. Three Cl-PFESAs and fourteen legacy PFASs were detected in human serum, fish, indoor dust and drinking water collected from Shijiazhuang, China. Results showed that 6:2 Cl-PFESA was the third most predominant compound, with an average concentration of 2.70 ng/mL in serum, which was lower than those of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctane acid (PFOA) (14.79 and 4.91 ng/mL). The estimated daily intake of 6:2 Cl-PFESA via dust ingestion (mean: 0.008 ng/kg bw/day) was found to be highest among all detected PFASs, while the highest value via fish and drinking water was found for PFOS and PFOA (0.438–9.799 and 0.034–0.155 ng/kg bw/day), respectively. The similar composition of PFASs between serum and fish suggests that fish consumption is a major contributor to human exposure to PFASs. However, the increasing ratios of EDIindoor dust/EDIfish for PFOS, PFOA and 6:2 Cl-PFESA indicated that the contribution of dust ingestion for PFASs, especially 6:2 Cl-PFESA, could not be ignored. The modeled serum concentrations of 6:2 Cl-PFESA higher than its observed levels hint at its gradually increasing exposure levels in the general population. Combined with the lower modeled levels of PFOS than the observed levels, the substituent with 6:2 Cl-PFESA for PFOS is obvious in China. Therefore, further studies on contributions from more detailed external sources and risk assessments of Cl-PFESAs are recommended, especially for some vulnerable subpopulations, considering their widespread exposure and similar environmental behaviors compared with those of their predecessors. © 2021 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106820,Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Sulfonic Acids;Ether;Ethers;China;Dust;animal;fluorocarbon;Human exposures;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Chlorine compounds;fish;organohalogen;pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;Risk assessment;sulfonic acid derivative;toxicity;human;serum;drinking water;Potable water;Drinking Water;ether derivative;ether;dust;Human exposure;Body fluids;Exposure pathways;Hebei;Sulphonic acids;Shijiazhuang;Human serum;Chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulphonic acid;Cl-PFESAs;Dust ingestion;Indoor dust;Legacy PFASs;Legacy polyfluoroalkyl substance;Humanities;Humanism;Sulfones;Drinking,NA,NA

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted 퓏-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (퓏-score = 6.20, 푝&lt; 0.001), PFOS (퓏-score = 3.55, 푝&lt; 0.001), and PFNA (퓏-score = 2.27, 푝= 0:023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis.

The present study assessed the toxicity of PFOS using the collembolan, Folsomia candida, and the oribatid mite, Oppia nitens, in two types of soil: a coarse-textured sandy loam (VSL) and fine-textured clay loam (NRS). As a standard O. nitens reproduction test is being formalized, the results of the study were also used to compare sensitivity across test species. Effects were soil dependent, with test species being 2–4 times more susceptible to PFOS in VSL, relative to NRS, likely due to differences in organic matter and clay content. Oppia nitens was significantly more sensitive to PFOS, regardless of soil type, in comparison to F. candida. The IC50s for reproduction for O. nitens were 23 mg kg−1 (95% confidence interval: 17–32 mg kg−1) in the VSL and 95 mg kg−1 (69–134 mg kg−1) in the NRS, and for F. candida were 94 mg kg−1 (72–122 mg kg−1) in the VSL and 233 mg kg−1 (177–306 mg kg−1) in the NRS. The present study demonstrates the application and inclusion of the oribatid mite, O. nitens, for the risk assessment of contaminants in soil. © 2018",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.020,Ecotoxicology;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;controlled study;Organic pollutants;pollutant;chemistry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;toxicity;Toxicity;drug effect;organic matter;soil;ecotoxicology;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;Soil;soil pollution;Soils;chemical analysis;surface soil;toxicity testing;analysis;organic pollutant;physiology;Risk perception;IC50;soil pollutant;Soil Pollutants;invertebrate;pharmacology;Ecotoxicological;soil acidity;soil property;Oligochaeta;soil quality;moisture;Surface soil;soil invertebrate;Acari;arthropod;Arthropods;Candida;clay loam;Fire fighting;Folsomia candida;mite;Mites;Oppia niten;Oppia nitens;Oribatida;sandy loam;Soil effects;Taxonomic groups;Textures;Training operations;Yeast;Sulfones,NA,NA

We investigated spatial profiles of PFASs in the Ugandan part of Lake Victoria, their influxes and human exposure via drinking water. We analyzed open lake water, riverine water (Rivers Kagera and Sio), urban drainage water (Nakivubo Channel), over-lake bulk atmospheric deposition and municipal tap water (Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe). The average concentrations (ng/L) for individual target PFASs were in the ranges of 0.08–23.8 (Nakivubo Channel), 0.01–10.8 (Murchison Bay), <MDL-5.38 (Kampala tap water), 0.01–3.64 (R.

Estimated contribution of input pathways to ∑PFAS fluxes into Lake Victoria was in the order atmospheric deposition > R. Kagera, >R. Sio > Nakivubo Channel. Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) had the highest influx and retention estimates, respectively. Perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) were mostly associated with urban drainage samples. PFASs were likely recycled from the Nakivubo Channel, through the Murchison Bay, into municipal drinking water.

Given their unique hydrophobicity, oil-repellence, and chemical stability, PFASs are widely used in various industrial and commercial products. PFASs can accumulate and be biomagnified through the food chain, and its toxic effects have posed a certain threat to human health. The response of the immune system to PFASs exposure is one of the most sensitive human health effects, and has attracted remarkable attention from related scientists and organizations. We summarized international and domestic epidemiological studies on the associations between exposure to PFASs and immune system, including immunosuppression and immunoenhancement. We also reviewed experimental evidence of PFASs on immune system from perspectives of immune organs, immune cells, and cytokines. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α)-dependent, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-activated, and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways were summarized. While the relationships between PFASs and immune-related diseases in human are not yet conclusive, accumulative epidemiological studies provide evidence for associations between PFASs and reduced immune response to vaccination in children. In addition, previous studies mainly focus on the immunotoxicity of traditional PFASs, and our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the effects of PFASs on immune system is still in its infancy. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the immunotoxicity of new PFASs and associated mechanism. © 2022 by the authors.

In a preliminary assessment prior to this study, very high concentrations (>1ppm wet weight) of the PFSA, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), were discovered in the plasma of snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) collected in 2008 from Lake Niapenco in southern Ontario, Canada. We presently report on a suite of C6 to C15 PFCAs, C4, C6, C8 and C10 PFSAs, several PFC precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, PFOSA), and a cyclic perfluorinated acid used in aircraft hydraulic fluid, perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS) in surface water from the Welland River and Lake Niapenco, downstream of the John C. Munro International Airport, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Amphipods, shrimp, and water were sampled from the Welland River and Lake Niapenco, as well as local references. The same suite of PFCs in turtle plasma from Lake Niapenco was compared to those from other southern Ontario sites. PFOS dominated the sum PFCs in all substrates (e.g., >99% in plasma of turtles downstream the Hamilton Airport, and 72.1 to 94.1% at all other sites).

Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were the dominant compounds, with respective mean concentrations of 11.0 ng/mL and 3.20 ng/mL for loggerhead turtles and 39.4 ng/mL and 3.57 ng/mL for Kemp's ridley turtles. Mean PFOS concentrations were 2- to 12-fold higher than typical mean ΣPCB concentrations (∼5 ng/g wet mass) measured previously in sea turtle blood. More than 79% of the samples had detectable levels of perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) with 8-12 carbons, whereas only 17% or less of samples had detectable levels of PFCAs with 6 or 7 carbons. No samples had detectable levels of PFCAs with 4 or 5 carbons. In loggerhead turtles, ΣPFC concentrations were not influenced by sex (p > 0.05), but were higher in turtles captured from inshore waters of NC than in turtles from offshore waters of SC-FL (p = 0.009). A backward stepwise multiple regression model showed that ZPFC concentrations were (1) significantly higher in Kemp's ridley turtles than loggerhead turtles (p < 0.0001), (2) higher in larger turtles (p = 0.018; carapace length used as a proxy for age), and (3) higher in turtles captured toward the north (p = 0.006).

A major PFAS producing facility is located in the Antwerp area and levels of PFASs in biota from that region have been found to be very high in previous studies. We aimed to investigate for the first time the main sources of PFASs in feathers of a terrestrial bird species. Throughout this study, we have used statistical methods for left-censored data to cope with levels below the limit of detection (LOD), instead of traditional, potentially biased, substitution methods.Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was detected in all tissues (range: 11. ng/g ww in muscle-1208. ng/g ww in preen oil) and in tail feathers (< 2.2-56.6. ng/g ww). Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was measured at high levels in feathers (< 14-670. ng/g ww), but not in tissues (more than 50% < LOD). Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) could only be quantified in liver and preen oil, while other PFASs were sporadically detected in liver. PFOS levels in feathers and liver were highly correlated (r=. 0.78, p< 0.01), in contrast to PFOA (r=. -0.11, p=. 0.78). Combined with high PFOA levels in feathers this suggests that PFOA may be present on the external surface of feathers, due to external contamination originating from the air in the vicinity of point sources. Therefore the possibility of using feathers as a passive air sampler for high PFOA levels should be investigated in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2012.11.002,Birds;PFASs;Feathers;Belgium;female;male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;biological monitoring;feather;raptor;bioaccumulation;survival;animal tissue;perfluoro compound;Histology;Muscle;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;quantitative analysis;biota;article;priority journal;tissue distribution;Antwerp [Belgium];tissue level;owl;perfluorohexane sulfonate;statistical analysis;Statistical methods;External contamination;Kaplan-Meier;Non-detects;Reverse Kaplan-Meier;soft tissue;Survival analysis;tail;tail feather;Tyto alba,NA,NA

Since no single targeted method can identify and quantify all OHCs, the size of the OHC “iceberg” may be underestimated. We sought to address this problem in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) sludge by quantifying the unidentified fraction of the OHC iceberg using targeted analyses of major OHCs together with measurements of total and extractable (organo)halogen (TX and EOX, respectively; where X = F, Cl, or Br). In addition to extensive method validation via spike/recovery and combustion efficiency experiments, TX and/or EOX were determined in reference materials (BCR-461 and NIST SRMs 2585 and 2781) for the first time. Application of the method to WWTP sludge revealed that chlorinated paraffins (CPs) accounted for most (∼92%) of the EOCl, while brominated flame retardants and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) accounted for only 54% of the EOBr and 2% of the EOF, respectively. Moreover, unidentified EOF in nonpolar CP extracts points to the existence of organofluorine(s) with physical-chemical properties unlike those of target PFAS. This study represents the first multihalogen mass balance in WWTP sludge and offers a novel approach to prioritization of sample extracts for follow-up investigation. © 2023 The Authors.

Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) have been detected globally in the hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere. Reducing treatment technologies such as reverses osmosis, nano-filtration and activated carbon can remove FCs from water. However, incineration of the concentrated waste is required for complete FC destruction. Recently, a number of alternative technologies for FC decomposition have been reported. The FC degradation technologies span a wide range of chemical processes including direct photolysis, photocatalytic oxidation, photochemical oxidation, photochemical reduction, thermally-induced reduction, and sonochemical pyrolysis. This paper reviews these FC degradation technologies in terms of kinetics, mechanism, energetic cost, and applicability.

They can incorporate into soil as nonextractable residues (NER) which are not detectable with conventional analytical protocols but are still possible to remobilize with changes of surrounding conditions, and thus will be bioavailable again. Therefore, there is a need to investigate thoroughly the long-term fate of NER-PFAS. In this study, a 240-day incubation of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and its alternative 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B) in a silty clay topsoil was carried out. Solvent extraction, alkaline hydrolysis and sequential chemical degradation were applied on periodically sampled soil to obtain extractable, moderately bound and deeply bound PFAS, respectively. The results confirmed the formation of NER of both compounds but with different preferences of incorporating mechanisms. NER-PFOS was formed predominantly by covalent binding (via head group) and strong adsorption (via tail group). The formation of NER-F-53B was mainly driven by physical entrapment. Both bound compounds within the incubation period showed three-stage behaviors including an initial period with slight release followed by a (re) incorporating stage and a subsequent remobilizing stage. This work provides some first insights on the long-term dynamic behaviors of nonextractable PFAS and will be conducive to their risk assessment and remediation (e.g. estimating potential NER-PFAS level based on their free extractable level, and selecting remediation methods according to their prevailing binding mechanisms). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143230,Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Ethers;incubation time;controlled study;persistent organic pollutant;bioavailability;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;chlorination;Solvent extraction;risk assessment;Risk assessment;adsorption;ecosystem restoration;environmental fate;remediation;priority journal;solvent extraction;Risk perception;Chemical degradation;degradation;ether;soil analysis;covalent bond;Remediation methods;soil organic matter;Per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances;ion chromatography;Clay;alkaline hydrolysis;Alkaline hydrolysis;Alkalinity;Analytical protocols;Dynamics;formation mechanism;Formation mechanisms;Long-term behaviors;Non-extractable residues;Nonextractable residues;Physical entrapment;remobilization;Remobilization;silty clay;Sulfones,NA,NA
rayyan-735663247,Selection and application of trophic magnification factors for priority substances to normalize freshwater fish monitoring data under the European Water Framework Directive: a case study,2020,10,17,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"[""2190-4707"", ""2190-4715""]",32,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Background The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the monitoring of biota-preferably fish-to check the compliance of tissue concentrations of priority substances (PS) against substance-specific environmental quality standards (EQSs). In monitoring programs, different fish species are covered, which often are secondary consumers with a trophic level (TL) of about 3. For harmonization, a normalization of monitoring data to a common trophic level is proposed, i.e., TL 4 (predatory fish) in freshwaters, so that data would be sufficiently protective. For normalization, the biomagnification properties of the chemicals can be considered by applying substance-specific trophic magnification factors (TMFs). Alternatively, TL-corrected biomagnification factors (BMF(TL)s) may be applied. Since it is impractical to derive site-specific TMFs or BMF(TL)s, often data from literature will be used for normalization. However, available literature values for TMFs and BMF(TL)s are quite varying. In the present study, the use of literature-derived TMFs and BMF(TL)s in data normalization is studied more closely. Results An extensive literature evaluation was conducted to identify appropriate TMFs for the WFD PS polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), hexachlorobenzene, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (PCDD/F + dl-PCB), hexabromocyclododecane, and mercury. The TMFs eventually derived were applied to PS monitoring data sets of fish from different trophic levels (chub, bream, roach, and perch) from two German rivers. For comparison, PFOS and PBDE data were also normalized using literature-retrieved BMF(TL)s. Conclusions The evaluation illustrates that published TMFs and BMF(TL)s for WFD PS are quite variable and the selection of appropriate values for TL 4 normalization can be challenging. The normalized concentrations partly included large uncertainties when considering the range of selected TMFs, but indicated whether an EQS exceedance at TL 4 can be expected. Normalization of the fish monitoring data revealed that levels of substances accumulating in the food web (TMF or BMF > 1) can be underestimated when relying on fish with TL < 4 for EQS compliance assessment. The evaluation also revealed that TMF specifically derived for freshwater ecosystems in Europe would be advantageous. Field-derived BMF(TL)s seemed to be no appropriate alternative to TMFs, because they can vary even stronger than TMFs.",NA,10.1186/s12302-020-00404-8,character(0),NA,NA

In this study, 130 whole blood samples from the Swedish general population were analyzed for extractable organofluorine (EOF) and selected per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Organofluorine mass balance analysis revealed that 60% (0-99%) of the EOF in female samples could not be explained by the 63 monitored PFAS; in males, 41% (0-93%) of the EOF was of unidentified origin. Significant differences between both age groups and gender were seen, with the highest fraction of UOF in young females (70% UOF, aged 18-44), which is contrary to what has been reported in the literature for commonly monitored compounds (e.g., perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, PFOS). Increasing the number of monitored PFAS did not lead to a large decrease of the UOF fraction; the seven highest PFAS (C8-C11 PFCAs, C6-C8 PFSAs) accounted for 98% of sum 63 PFAS. The high fraction of UOF in human samples is of concern, as the chemical species of these organofluorine compounds remain unknown and thus their potential health risks cannot be assessed. © 2021 The Authors.

Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) were the most frequently detected PFASs in the samples of tap waters. The maximum concentrations in tap waters were measured as 2.90, 2.37, 2.18, 2.04, and 1.93 ng/L, for PFHxA, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), respectively. The most abundant perfluorinated chemical in tap water samples was PFBA with 17%, followed by PFOS (13%), PFBS (12%), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) (11%), PFHxA (11%), and PFOA (11%). The total PFASs concentration in tap water ranged from 0.08 to 11.27 ng/L. As regards bottled waters, the concentrations of PFASs were generally lower than those in tap water samples. These results revealed that tap water samples in Turkey might be considered generally safe based on the established guidelines around the world.

Chemical substances considered as emerging contaminants (ECs) are one of the most important indicators of the anthropic influence on the environment, and they have recently shown to interact with microplastics (MPs). Mussels are suitable for in-lab bioacumulation studies providing insight about the occurrence and fate of contaminants in the organisms. In this study, bioacummulation of 20 chemical substances catalogued as ECs, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in Mytilus galloprovincialis was assessed, with or without the influence of the presence of MPs. Mussels were distributed in three groups: control (B), exposed to ECs (C) and exposed to ECs and polyethylene MPs (C+M). The study was carried out for 58 days separated in two stages (i) exposure during days 0–28, and (ii) depuration during days 29–58. Visceral mass and haemolymph of the mussels were extracted separately, using QuEChERS and solid phase extraction (SPE), respectively. Then, extracts were analysed via UHPLC-MS/MS. Results showed that 3 PPCPs, 4 pesticides and 3 PFASs accumulated in visceral mass with bioconcentration factors (BCFs) ranging 6.7–15000 L/kg/d. In addition, 2 PPCPs, 2 pesticides and PFPeA were detected in haemolymph showing BCFs ranging 0.9–3.3 L/kg/d. When comparing C and C+M, MPs worked as a vector for the accumulation of the PFASs: PFOA, PFOS, PFDA and PFPeA; showing higher BCFs in the presence of MPs. Furthermore, the elimination of PFDA and PFOS was slower in the mussels exposed to MPs. On the other hand, the pesticides terbuthylazine and chlorpyrifos showed lower BCFs and more rapid elimination in the mussels exposed to MPs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149006,Biochemistry;Humans;PFASs;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Bioaccumulation;Pesticides;animal;environmental exposure;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;pollutant;animal tissue;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;Phase separation;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;quality control;water pollution;solid phase extraction;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Emerging contaminant;human;pesticide;Exposed to;elimination reaction;limit of quantitation;organofluorine;plastic;Plastics;chlorpyrifos;cosmetic;PPCP;Microplastic;Microplastics;coastal waters;microplastic;environmental impact;Drug products;Molluscs;numerical model;triclosan;Water Pollutants;Chemical;plastic waste;paracetamol;polyethylene;Bioconcentration factor;Indicators (chemical);Mytilus;caffeine;Pharmaceuticals;Half lives;Half-life;human activities;diclofenac;mathematical analysis;atenolol;bentazon;Chemical substance;clofenvinfos;enilconazole;etoricoxib;hemolymph;Kinetic model;Kinetic models;mollusc;Mytilus galloprovincialis;naproxen;personal care products;Pharmaceutical;reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography;salicylic acid;terbutylazine;vildagliptin,NA,NA

The extent to which PFAS are absorbed by plants may differ among species and may depend on environmental factors, including temperature. The effect of an increased temperature on root uptake and translocation of PFAS in plants has been poorly studied. In addition, very few studies have examined toxicity of environmentally realistic PFAS concentrations to plants. Here, we investigated the bioaccumulation and tissue-distribution of fifteen PFAS in Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown in vitro at two different temperatures. Additionally, we examined the combined effects of temperature and PFAS accumulation on plant growth. Short-chained PFAS mainly accumulated in the leaves. The perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCA) concentrations in roots and leaves, and the relative contribution of PFCAs to the ΣPFAS concentrations increased with carbon chain length regardless of temperature, with the exception of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). An increased uptake of PFAS in leaves and roots at higher temperatures was observed for PFAS containing either eight or nine carbon atoms and could hence potentially result in higher risks for human intake. Leaf:root ratios of PFCAs followed a U-shaped pattern with carbon chain length, which is attributed to both hydrophobicity and anion exchange. Overall, no combined effects of realistic PFAS concentrations and temperature on the growth of A. thaliana were observed. PFAS exposure positively affected early root growth rates and root hair lengths, indicating a potential effect on factors involved in root hair morphogenesis. However, this effect on root growth rate became negligible later on in the exposure, and solely a temperature effect was observed after 6 days. Temperature also affected the leaf surface area. The underlying mechanisms on how PFAS stimulates root hair growth require further examination. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA,10.1007/s11356-023-27237-1,PFAS;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Bioaccumulation;Temperature;fluorocarbon;carbon;Carbon;bioaccumulation;hydrophobicity;water pollutant;alkanesulfonic acid;toxicity;human;growth rate;leaf morphology;temperature effect;temperature;plant;Water Pollutants;Plants;anion;Chemical;Phytotoxicity;Plant;Arabidopsis;translocation;leaf;Root growth;Root hair,NA,NA

They reported high fractions of unidentified organic fluorine (UOF) compounds, as the target analysis covers only a limited number of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). For this reason, in this study, a comprehensive approach was used combining target analysis with an extended PFAS spectrum, the EOF and a modified total oxidisable precursor (TOP) assay, which includes trifluoroacetic acid, to determine the PFAS contamination in sediments (n=41) and suspended solids (n=1) from water bodies in Northern Germany (Lower Saxony). PFAS are ubiquitous in the sediments (detected in 83% of the samples). Perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were found in 64% of the samples; perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were detected less frequently (21%), with the highest concentration observed for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Levels of precursors and substitutes were lower. Applying the TOP assay resulted in an increase in PFCAs in 43% of the samples analysed. In most cases, target analysis and the TOP assay could not account for the EOF concentrations measured. However, as the fraction of UOF decreased significantly, the application of the TOP assay in fluorine mass balance analysis proved to be an important tool in characterising the PFAS contamination of riverine sediments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA,10.1007/s11356-022-21588-x,PFAS;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Environmental Monitoring;Carboxylic Acids;Sulfonic Acids;fluorocarbon;environmental monitoring;chemical substance;water pollutant;chemical compound;concentration (composition);alkanesulfonic acid;procedures;sulfonic acid derivative;carboxylic acid;bioassay;Germany;Precursors;Target analysis;sediment pollution;fluorine;Fluorine;Water Pollutants;Sediment;Chemical;TOP assay;Extractable organofluorine (EOF);Fluorine mass balance analysis;Lower Saxony,NA,NA

However, the epidemiological evidence is limited and inconsistent. We examined the associations of single and multiple PFAS exposures in utero with adipocytokine concentrations in umbilical cord serum. Methods: This study included 1111 mother-infant pairs from Sheyang Mini Birth Cohort Study (SMBCS), and quantified 12 PFAS and two adipokine in umbilical cord serum. Generalized linear models (GLMs) and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) models were applied to estimate the associations of single- and mixed- PFAS exposure with adipokines, respectively. Furthermore, sex-stratification was done in each model to assess the sexually dimorphic effects of PFAS. Results: 10 PFAS were detected with median concentrations (μg/L) ranging from 0.04 to 3.97, (except 2.7% for PFOSA and 1.7% for PFDS, which were excluded). In GLMs, for each doubling increase in PFBS, PFHpA, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFUnDA and PFDoDA, leptin decreased between 14.04% for PFBS and 22.69% for PFHpS (P < 0.05). PFAS, except for PFNA, were positively associated with adiponectin, and for each doubling of PFAS, adiponectin increased between 3.27% for PFBS and 12.28% for PFHxS (P < 0.05). In addition, infant gender modified the associations of PFAS with adipokines, especially the associations of PFBS, PFOA and PFHxS with adiponectin. Similarly, significant associations of PFAS mixtures with leptin and adiponectin were observed in the BKMR models. PFDA, PFOS, PFNA and PFHpS were identified as important contributors. In the sex-stratified analysis of BKMR models, the associations between PFAS mixtures and adipokines were more pronounced in males. Conclusions: PFAS levels were significantly associated with adipokines in cord serum, suggesting that intrauterine mixture of PFAS exposure may be related to decreased fetal leptin level but increased fetal adiponectin level and the associations may be sex-specific. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114654,PFAS;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;China;Cohort Studies;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;unclassified drug;Mixtures;sex difference;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;chemical substance;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;human;serum;infant;cohort analysis;perfluoroheptanoic acid;endocrine disruptor;prenatal exposure;perfluorobutane sulfonate;perflubutane;perfluoroheptane sulfonate;umbilical cord blood;prospective study;numerical model;adiponectin;prenatal development;secretion;Bayes theorem;Bayes Theorem;leptin;adipocytokine;Adipokines;umbilical cord;Jiangsu;Umbilical Cord;gender;Adipokine;Adiponectin;BKMR models;Cord serum;Leptin;Sheyang,NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to determine the toxic effects of sublethal PFOS on the aquatic invertebrate organism, narrow-clawed crayfish [Astacus leptodactylus Eschscholtz, 1823]. The 96 h LC50 value was determined as 48.81 mg/L (34.19-63.68 mg/L) with probit analysis. The sublethal experimental design was formed into four groups solvent control (DMSO, dimethyl sulphoxide), non-treated control group, and 1/10 (5 mg/L) and 1/100 (0.5 mg/L) of 96 h LC50 of PFOS, and crayfish were exposed for 48 h, 7 d, and 21 d under laboratory conditions. Total haemocyte counts (THCs) decreased, while the haemolymph total antioxidant status (TAS) values increased (p < 0.05) after exposure to 0.5 and 5 mg/L PFOS for 48 h, 7 d, and 21 d. Haemolymph total oxidative stress (TOS) levels significantly increased at 5 mg/L PFOS concentration (p < 0.05). Catalase (CAT) activities increased at both concentrations after 48 h and 7 d and then returned to control levels after 21 d; whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities did not change in muscle tissue (p > 0.05). GPX and CAT activities decreased, but SOD activity increased in hepatopancreas tissue (p < 0.05). SOD activity at both concentrations and CAT activity at 5 mg/L PFOS exposure decreased in gill tissue, while GPX activity increased at both concentrations of 48 h and 7 d and returned to control values on day 21 of exposure. Histopathological alterations were detected in hepatopancreas and gill tissues. Lamellar deformations, epithelial hyperplasia, and haemocytic infiltrations were observed in the gill tissues, whereas tubular degeneration, tubule loss, necrosis, and lesions in the hepatopancreas tissues were the major recorded alterations. As a result, the sublethal concentrations of PFOS have toxic effects on crayfish and histologically cause tissue damage.

Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two PFAS that are commonly found at high concentrations in aquatic environments. Both chemicals have previously been shown to be toxic to fish, as well as having complex and largely uncharacterized mixture effects. However, limited information is available on marine and estuarine species. In this study, embryonic and larval sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) were exposed to several PFAS mixtures to assess lethal and sublethal effects. PFOS alone was acutely toxic to larvae, with a 96 h LC50 of 1.97 mg/L (1.64–2.16). PFOS + PFOA resulted in a larval LC50 of 3.10 (2.62–3.79) mg/L, suggesting an antagonistic effect. These observations were supported by significant reductions in malondialdehyde (105% ± 3.25) and increases in reduced glutathione concentrations (43.8% ± 1.78) in PFOS + PFOA exposures compared to PFOS-only treatments, indicating reduced oxidative stress. While PFOA reduced PFOS-induced mortality (97.0% ± 3.03), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) did not. PFOS alone did not affect expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (pparα) but significantly upregulated apolipoprotein A4 (apoa4) (112.4% ± 17.8), a downstream product of pparα, while none of the other individually tested PFAS affected apoa4 expression. These findings suggest that there are antagonistic interactions between PFOA and PFOS that may reduce mixture toxicity in larval sheepshead minnows through reduced oxidative stress.

Investigation of contamination profiles, distribution, possible sources and risks of PFCs in Liaohe River, an industry-influenced river in northeast China was conducted in the present study. Results: The total PFCs concentrations (∑PFCs) were in the range 0.38–127.88 ng/L (average value of 36.41 ng/L) in water and 1.72–10.44 ng/g dry weight (average of 4.99 ng/g) in sediment. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant individual in water and sediment phases, in the range 0.38–73.94 ng/L in water and below detection limit (BDL) to 7.88 ng/g dw in the sediments. The organic carbon normalized partition coefficients (Koc) ranged from 2.46 L/kg (PFHxA) to 4.29 L/kg (PFUnDA). The average Koc values for perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) increased by 0.13–0.62 log unit with each increasing CF2 moiety, and the Koc values were lower than perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFASs). The sources of PFCs identified from diagnostic ratios suggested that the contaminants were mainly from the emission of manufacturing processes and precursors degradation. Result from risk assessment indicated that the immediate health impact through intaking water was negligible, but the levels of PFOA in surface water might cause effects on aquatic ecosystem. The mass inventories of ∑PFCs and PFOA were estimated to be 328.74 t and 103.43 t in the study area, respectively, suggesting that the sediment in Liaohe River may act as a potential PFCs source to the surrounding areas. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that PFCs were widely presented in the water and sediments of Liaohe River. In general, PFCAs had higher concentrations and detection frequency than PFSAs, and PFCAs with short carbon chains had much higher detection frequencies than long-carbon chain compounds in water. Among all PFC homologues, the average Koc increased with the increased carbon chain. Koc values were higher for PFSAs than PFCAs. The risk assessment suggested that PFOA in water may exert adverse effect on the aquatic ecosystem.

Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) arriving via long-range transport have been detected in Arctic wildlife, including seabirds which are considered sentinels of marine ecosystem health. There is evidence that PFAA exposure leads to the disruption of thyroid hormones (THs), such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which play important roles in metabolism, incubation, and thermoregulation in seabirds. Here, we investigated relationships between PFAAs and THs [total T4 (TT4), free T4 (FT4), total T3 (TT3) and free T3 (FT3)] in blood plasma collected from 63 thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) at a colony located in northern Hudson Bay (2016–2018). We then tested if PFAAs and TH levels were related to fitness-associated reproductive traits, such as body mass and hatch dates. PFUdA, PFOS, and PFTrDA were the dominant PFAAs in murre blood, accounting for approximately 77% of ∑PFAA. Females had higher PFAAs than males, possibly due to higher trophic feeding. While FT3 increased with PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFDoA, PFTeDA, ∑PFCA7, and ∑PFAA in murres, TT3 decreased with PFOS, PFDoA, and PFTeDA in males, but not females, suggesting thyroid disruption. TT3 increased with body mass, whereas several long-chain PFAAs were negatively correlated with body mass. Negative relationships between PFNA, PFDoA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, and ∑PFAA with hatch dates may be the result of a disruption in incubation behaviour, resulting in earlier hatch dates. Consequently, TT3 concentrations were highest in males and females in 2018, a year in which PFAAs were lowest and hatch dates were delayed relative to 2017. As an Arctic seabird experiencing several indirect effects of climate change, the interaction of PFAAs on thyroid activity may cause additional stress to murres. © 2022",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119181,Seabirds;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Thyroid Hormones;Canada;animal;Arctic;Arctic marine;Arctic Regions;Arctic seabirds;Blood;body mass;Body mass;Cell proliferation;Charadriiformes;climate change;Climate change;concentration (parameter);ecosystem;Ecosystem;Ecosystems;Endocrinology;environmental chemical;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;Hormones;incubation time;liothyronine;male;Male;Marine biology;Marine pollution;nonhuman;perfluoroalkyl acid;Perfluoroalkyl acid;reproduction;Reproduction;Reproductive success;seabird;Seabird;thyroid hormone;Thyroid hormones;thyroxine;Thyroxine;Triiodothyronine;trophic level;unclassified drug;persistent organic pollutant;long range transport;hormone;reproductive success;Hudson Bay;Thyroid Gland,NA,NA

In addition to traditional PFASs, over 330 other fluorinated analytes belonging to 10 classes of PFASs were detected among the pooled fish livers, including 6 sulfonate classes, 2 amine classes, 1 carboxylate class, and 1 N-heterocycle class. One class was detected in samples from both locations, 8 classes were detected exclusively in Tangxun Lake fish, and 1 class was detected exclusively in Yangtze River fish, 10 km downstream of a fluorochemical manufacturing site where we first reported these substances in wastewater 3 years ago. Overall, 4 of the PFAS classes (>165 analytes) are reported for the first time here. Wider monitoring and toxicological testing should be a priority for understanding the health risks posed to people and wildlife exposed to these substances.

This study reports the concentrations of a suite of PFCs: perfluorooctyl sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctyl sulfonamide (PFOSA) and perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in guillemot (Uria aalge) eggs, collected in North-Western Europe, from Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Sweden and two locations in Norway. The highest concentrations of PFOS were found in samples from Sweden (mean 400 ng g-1 wet weight (w.w.)), which were almost five times higher than concentrations found in Norwegian samples (mean 85 ng g-1 w.w. from both sample sites). The concentrations found in Icelandic and Faroe samples were lowest (mean 16 and 15 ng g-1 w.w., respectively). Only Swedish samples differed significantly from the other locations. In general, PFCAs show a different spatial trend than PFOS. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was not detected in any sample and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was only detected in samples from Sweden. The most abundant PFCA was perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA) with highest concentrations in samples from Sweden (mean 82 ng g-1 w.w.), samples from the Faroe Islands had the second highest concentration (mean 57 ng g-1 w.w.) and samples from Iceland and Norway had concentrations ranging between 18 and 30 ng g-1 w.w. The original hypothesis was based on the idea that PFC concentrations are the highest close to more densely populated and industrialized areas and lower levels in remote areas. However, the geographic pattern is more complicated than predicted and varies among different PFCs. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the penetration of PFASs across the brain barrier and its determining factors are yet to be clarified in humans. We studied PFAS levels in 223 matched-pair serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from hospital in-patients using UPLC/MS/MS. Among the 21 target analytes, PFOA, PFOS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA were dominant in serum, with mean concentrations of 7.4, 6.8, and 6.2 ng/mL, respectively, contributing 79% to the total PFAS burden in serum. In CSF, PFOA, PFOS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA were again the dominant PFASs, with mean concentrations of 0.078, 0.028, and 0.051 ng/mL contributing 36%, 13%, and 24%, respectively, to the total PFAS burden in CSF. Furthermore, PFAS penetration (RPFAS, PFASCSF/PFASserum) was positively correlated with the barrier permeability index RAlb (AlbuminCSF/Albuminserum), indicating that barrier integrity was the main determinant of PFAS penetration across the blood-CSF barrier. Positive associations between the RPFAS values of the main PFASs and serum C-reactive protein were observed, implying that inflammation facilitates the penetration of PFASs across the brain barrier. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.8b04550,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Brain;Blood;female;fluorocarbon;male;unclassified drug;analytic method;bioaccumulation;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;brain;human;serum;ultra performance liquid chromatography;major clinical study;blood sampling;polyfluoroalkyl substance;blood;pollution effect;neurotoxicity;Target analytes;Animalia;organic compound;liquid liquid extraction;Mean concentrations;perfluoroalkyl;inflammation;laboratory method;fluoride;C reactive protein;Inflammation;medical parameters;blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier;Blood-cerebrospinal fluid-barrier;C-reactive proteins;Cerebro spinal fluids;Cerebrospinal fluid;hospital patient;Laboratory studies;permeability;Permeability;Permeability index;Humanities;Humanism;Cerebrospinal Fluid,NA,NA

They are exceptionally stable and highly mobile in the environment, and were detected in high concentrations in Arctic wildlife and Nunavik Inuit. The study's objective was to study the association between dietary profiles in Nunavik and plasma PFAAs concentrations. Methods: The study used data from the Qanuilirpitaa? 2017 Nunavik Inuit Health Survey (Q2017) (N = 1172) on Inuit adults aged 16–80 years. Nine PFAAs congeners were measured in plasma samples (six were detected). Dietary profiles were identified using latent profile analysis. Two sets of dietary profiles were included; the first included market (store-bought) and country foods (harvested/hunted from the land), and the second included only country foods. Multiple linear regression models regressed log-transformed PFAAs concentrations against the dietary profiles, adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Results: We identified statistically significant 24.54–57.55 % increases in all PFAAs congeners (PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS) in the dietary profile defined by frequent country food consumption compared to the dietary profile defined by frequent market food consumption. Individuals defined by low consumption of foods (related to food insecurity) had higher concentrations of six PFAAs compared to individuals with frequent market food consumption. The associations were stronger with profiles defined by more frequent country food consumption, and particularly those with increased marine mammal consumption. PFDA, PFUnDA, and PFOS were particularly associated with high country food consumption frequency, such that their concentrations increased by approximately 67–83 % compared to those reporting no or very little consumption of any country foods. Conclusions: Increased country food consumption was strongly associated with higher PFAAs concentrations, particularly PFOS, PFDA, and PFUnDA. The results provide further evidence that the quality of country foods is being threatened by PFAAs contamination. Additional national and international regulations are required to protect the Arctic and its inhabitants from these pollutants. © 2022 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159557,PFAS;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Adolescent;animal;Arctic;concentration (parameter);female;fluorocarbon;male;perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;controlled study;dietary intake;food contamination;plasma;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;food;Mammals;diet;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;human;Adult;aged;very elderly;adolescent;Dietary exposure;organofluorine derivative;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;perfluorononanoic acid;food intake;limit of detection;food consumption;Diet;Chemical contamination;fluorotelomer alcohol;Industrial chemicals;Surveys;dietary pattern;Consumer applications;young population;socioeconomics;Synthetic chemicals;demography;acid;statistical significance;mammal;indigenous population;health survey;food frequency questionnaire;Food consumption;Food supply;Acid concentrations;Exposure determinants;Indigenous;Inuit;Linear regression;multiple linear regression analysis;animal hunting;Commerce;country food;Dietary exposures;dietary profile;food insecurity;harvest;Inuits;marine mammal consumption;market food,NA,NA

Freshwater fish species, namely carp, snakehead, and catfish, were collected in Japan, Vietnam, India, Malaysia, and Thailand, and 10 PFSs, including perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate, were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. PFSs in carp in Tokyo were more concentrated in kidneys (Sigma 10 PFSs = 257 +/- 95 ng/g wet weight [ww]) and livers (119 +/- 36 ng/g ww) than in ovaries (43 +/- 2 ng/g ww) and muscles (24 +/- 17 ng/g ww). Concentrations of PFOS and its precursor, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, in livers of carp and in waters in Tokyo showed a dramatic decrease during the last decade, probably because of 3 M's phasing-out of the manufacture of perfluorooctanesulfonyl-fluoride-based products in 2000. In contrast, continuing contamination by long-chain perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) with >= 9 fluorinated carbons was seen in multiple media, suggesting that these compounds continue to be emitted. PFS concentrations in freshwater fish species in tropical Asian countries were generally lower than those in developed countries, such as Japan, e. g., for PFOS in muscle, Vietnam < 0.05-0.3 ng/g ww; India < 0.05-0.2 ng/g ww; Malaysia < 0.05-0.2 ng/g ww; Thailand < 0.05 ng/g ww; and Japan (Tokyo) = 5.1-22 ng/g ww.

Hepatic concentrations of nine PFAAs were analysed in 49 stranded stingrays from eastern Australia using liquid chromatograph coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and relationships with biological parameters (i.e. body size, age and sex) were investigated. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) were the predominant compounds quantified, with hepatic concentrations varying from 2 to 117 and from 0.2 to 19 ng.g(-1) w.w., respectively. A negative correlation between the concentration of PFASs in the livers of 32 blue-spotted stingrays and the body size/age was found. This relationship was independent of the animal's sex. We postulate that the dependence on body size is related to differing uptake kinetics of the chemicals, after the sting rays were exposed to an increased level of the contaminants in their environment Such a pollution event could be related to a severe flood event that occurred at this location a few months before the samples' collection. Our results indicate that the influence of the body size/age should be taken into account when estimating bioaccumulation parameters from environmental measurements or exposure levels of biota to PFASs.

PFOS exposure is positively correlated with the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Given that dopamine (DA) is a crucial target for PFOS and that its dysfunction is a key role in ADHD development, it is speculated that PFOS exposure contributes to the occurrence of ADHD to some extent by disrupting DA homeostasis. To establish the relationship between PFOS exposure, DA dysfunction, and ADHD-like behavior, adult zebrafish were exposed to PFOS for 21 days using PFOS concentrations in the serum of patients with ADHD as the reference exposure dose. Results showed that PFOS caused ADHD-like behaviors, with the presence of the slightly elevated percentage of time spent in movement and prolonged time spent in reaching the target zone in the T-maze. Hyperactivity and cognitive ability impairment were more severe with increasing PFOS concentrations. Further investigation showed that PFOS exposure resulted in a decrease in the DA content, accompanied by a decrease in the number of dopaminergic neurons and a disturbance in the transcription profiles of genes associated with the dopaminergic system. Treatment with Ritalin effectively alleviated PFOS-induced ADHD-like behavior and restored DA levels, number of dopaminergic neurons, and expression of DA metabolism-related genes, suggesting that PFOS exposure induced ADHD-like behavior by triggering DA secretion disorder. This study enriches our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ADHD development and emphasizes the importance of focusing on the health risks pertaining to environmental exposure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.neuro.2023.11.004,Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Animals;Article;Environmental Exposure;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;animal;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;animal tissue;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;adult;drug effect;human;Adult;disease association;metabolism;animal model;zebra fish;genetic transcription;Zebrafish;drug mechanism;treatment outcome;cognition;drug efficacy;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;ADHD;clinical effectiveness;dopamine;Dopamine;dopamine metabolism;dopamine release;dopaminergic nerve cell;drug response;hyperactivity;learning disorder;memory disorder;methylphenidate;Ritalin;T-maze test;Sulfones;Sulfonic Acids,NA,NA

Among the matrices used for OHCs biomonitoring, feathers are particularly useful as they can be collected in a minimally or non-invasive manner. In this study, concentrations of various legacy OHCs -polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polybmminated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)-, as well as emerging OHCs -per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPEs)- were determined in feathers of 72 Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo) from Norway, with the goal of studying spatiotemporal variation using a non-invasive approach. Molted feathers were collected at nest sites from northern, central and southern Norway across four summers (2013-2016). Additionally, two museum-archived feathers from 1979 to 1989 were included. Stable carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen isotopes (delta 15N) were used as dietary proxies. In total, 11 PFAS (sum range 8.25-215.90 ng g(-1)), 15 PCBs (4.19-430.01 ng g(-1)), 6 OCPs (1.48-220.94 ng g(-1)), 5 PBDEs (0.21-5.32 ng g(-1)) and 3 OPEs (4.49-222.21 ng g(-1)) were quantified.

However, the study about their bioaccumulation mechanism remains scarce. In this research, the bioaccumulation of six kinds of PFAs in water flea Daphnia magna was studied. The uptake rates of PFAs in D. magna ranged from 178 to 1338Lkg-1d-1, and they increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl chain length; the elimination rates ranged from 0.98 to 2.82d-1. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of PFAs ranged from 91 to 380Lkg-1 in wet weight after 25d exposure; they increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl chain length and had a significant positive correlation with the n-octanol/water partition coefficients (logKow) of PFAs (p<0.05). This indicated that the hydrophobicity of PFAs plays an important role in their bioaccumulation. The BAFs almost kept constant when the PFA concentrations in aqueous phase increased from 1 to 10μgL-1. Scenedesmus subspicatus, as the food of D. magna, did not significantly affect the bioaccumulation of PFAs by D. magna. Furthermore, the body burden of PFAs in the dead D. magna was 1.08-2.52 times higher than that in the living ones, inferring that the body surface sorption is a main uptake route of PFAs in D. magna. This study suggested that the bioaccumulation of PFAs in D. magna is mainly controlled by their partition between organisms and water; further research should be conducted to study the intrinsic mechanisms, especially the roles of protein and lipid in organisms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.08.026,Biochemistry;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Bioaccumulation;nonhuman;perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;bioaccumulation;alkyl group;hydrophobicity;lipid;quality control;concentration (composition);article;Positive correlations;aqueous solution;chemical structure;correlation analysis;Alcohols;Daphnia magna;partition coefficient;chemical reaction kinetics;Chain length;sorption;Perfluorinated compound (PFCs);Perfluoroalkyl chains;Bioaccumulation factor;nutrient uptake;Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs);academic research;Cladocera;Desmodesmus subspicatus;flea;PFAs;Scenedesmus;scenedesmus subspicatus;Uptake route,NA,NA

Although most studies of neurotoxicity consider the effects of BMAA as an isolated molecule, it is now known that environmental exposures can be to a combination of BMAA-related molecules, including enantiomers, isomers, other co-occurring cyanotoxins, and BMAA carbamates. Within the body, BMAA may exist in equilibrium with α- and β-carbamates formed in the presence of bicarbonate. BMAA and its isomers 2,4-DAB and AEG, accumulate over decades in biocrusts and persist at depths in soil profiles of the Gulf deserts. In Florida, releases of cyanobacterially ladened water from Lake Okeechobee can extend into coastal environments where diatoms and possibly dinoflagellates also produce BMAA and isomers in addition to brevetoxins. Along the African Lake Chad, neurotoxic risks from consumption of dried cyanobacterial cakes may, however, be outweighed by their amino acid addition to otherwise protein-deficient diets. Discrepancies in the detection and quantification of BMAA from different laboratories likely originate in the use of different analytical methods. C-18 columns, used to study derivatized BMAA, can efficiently separate BMAA from its isomers in validated methods, while validation is not possible for HILIC columns in the study of underivatized BMAA, since they do not adequately separate BMAA from its isomer BAMA. The presence of BMAA dimers, metal adducts, and carbamates may result in underestimation of BMAA by mass spectrometry. BMAA research led to the identification of the dietary amino acid L-serine as a neuroprotective molecule. In animal and clinical trials, L-serine appears to slow neurodegeneration, although the modes of action are still under study. Based on zebra fish sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents, investigators have found that L-serine reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) but does not protect auditory hybridoma cells from cisplatin. Another possible mode of action of L-serine, induction of autophagic-lysosomal enzymes, is also being explored. The hypothesis that cyanobacterial exposures in general, and chronic exposures to BMAA in particular, may prove to be risk factors for neurodegenerative illnesses has not been without critics. Emerging from the symposium, a multi-authored response to one such critical paper appears in this collection of articles.

Lakes are one of the main sinks of POPs. POPs can be accumulated in multiple matrices in lake ecosystems and biomagnified through the food web, and thus pose a potential threat not only to lake ecosystems, but also to human health. Given their potential persistent risks, they have received much attention over the past decades. This review comprehensively summarizes the data on the levels and distributions of POPs in selected typical lake ecosystems in China and worldwide, involving water, sediments, organisms, and surrounding soils and atmosphere. It was found that current publications on POPs in Chinese lakes are mainly related to lakes in the developed eastern plain area, with only a few studies concerning the less-developed Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area. Similarly, around the world, there are more research on POPs in developed countries and less in relatively less-developed areas. Moreover, there are significant differences in the levels of POPs in different matrices in different lake ecosystems. Legacy POPs, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were commonly detected and reported in different lakes, while emerging POPs like perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and hexabromocyclododecane (HCBD) were relatively less detected or reported. A comprehensive summarization on the levels and distributions of traditional and emerging POPs in lake ecosystems could be significant for further understanding the behaviors and risks of POPs in lake ecosystems.",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.05.060,character(0),NA,NA

This study aimed to fill knowledge gaps concerning the tissue-specific distribution patterns and bioaccumulation behavior of PFAAs and their isomers, alternatives, and precursors (collectively as per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFASs) within citrus trees growing in contaminated fields. It also assessed the potential contribution of precursor degradation to human exposure risk of PFASs. High concentrations of total target PFASs (∑PFASstarget, 92.45–7496.16 ng/g dw) and precursors measured through the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay (130.80–13979.21 ng/g dw) were found in citrus tree tissues, and short-chain PFASs constituted the primary components. The total PFASs concentrations followed the order of leaves > fruits > branches, bark > wood, and peel > pulp > seeds. The average contamination burden of peel (∑PFASstarget: 57.75%; precursors: 71.15%) was highest among fruit tissues. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) and translocation potentials of short-chain, branched, or carboxylate-based PFASs exceeded those of their relatively hydrophobic counterparts, while ether-based PFASs showed lower BAFs than similar PFAAs in above-ground tissues of citrus trees. In the risk assessment of residents consuming contaminated citruses, precursor degradation contributed approximately 36.07% to total PFASs exposure, and therefore should not be ignored. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133184,Biochemistry;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Carboxylation;Environmental Monitoring;Bioaccumulation;Trees;Risk Assessment;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;controlled study;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;chemistry;Health risks;perfluoroalkanoic acid;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Histology;alkanesulfonic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;Risks assessments;Tissue;fruit;human;soil;Contamination;bioassay;Tissue-specific distributions;health hazard;chemical composition;chemical structure;pollution;plant leaf;Isomers;isomer;bark;biodegradation;public health;tissue specificity;precursor;Shorter chains;Plants (botany);Water Pollutants;plant seed;Chemical;Human health risks;estimated daily intake;Total oxidizable precursor assay;Bioaccumulation behavior;Citrus;citrus fruit;Citrus tree;dicotyledon;fruit peel;fruit pulp;Health hazards;Human health risk;orchard;Per-/polyfluoroalkyl substance;Per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances;tree;wood;Organ Specificity,NA,NA

To accelerate PFAS hazard evaluation, new approach methodologies (NAMs) comprised of in vitro high-throughput toxicity screening, toxicokinetic data, and computational modeling are being employed in read across strategies to evaluate the larger PFAS landscape. A critical consideration to ensure robust evaluations is a parallel assessment of the quality of the screening stock solutions, where dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is often the diluent of choice. Challenged by the lack of commercially available reference standards for many of the selected PFAS and reliance on mass spectrometry approaches for such an evaluation, we developed a high-throughput framework to evaluate the quality of screening stocks for 205 PFAS selected for these NAM efforts. Using mass spectrometry coupled with either liquid or gas chromatography, a quality scoring system was developed that incorporated observations during mass spectral examination to provide a simple pass or fail notation. Informational flags were used to further describe findings regarding parent analyte presence through accurate mass identification, evidence of contaminants and/or degradation, or further describe characteristics such as isomer presence. Across the PFAS-DMSO stocks tested, 148 unique PFAS received passing quality scores to allow for further in vitro testing whereas 57 received a failing score primarily due to detection issues or confounding effects of DMSO. Principle component analysis indicated vapor pressure and Henry's Law Constant as top indicators for a failed quality score for those analyzed by gas chromatography. Three PFAS in the hexafluoropropylene oxide family failed due to degradation in DMSO. As the PFAS evaluated spanned over 20 different structural categories, additional commentary describes analytical observations across specific groups related to PFAS stock composition, detection, stability, and methodologic considerations that will be useful for informing future analytical assessment and downstream HTS efforts. The high-throughput stock quality scoring workflow presented holds value as a tool to evaluate chemical presence and quality efficiently and for informing data inclusion in PFAS or other NAM screening efforts. © 2022",NA,10.1016/j.taap.2022.116355,PFAS;Fluorocarbons;Article;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;analytic method;controlled study;alkyl group;computer simulation;in vitro study;Mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;principal component analysis;liquid chromatography;sulfonic acid derivative;mass spectrometry;gas chromatography;water;carboxylic acid derivative;perfluoropentanoic acid;perfluorobutane sulfonate;perfluorobutanoic acid;toxicity testing;perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid;molecular weight;alcohol;fluorotelomer alcohol;ether derivative;evaluation study;perfluorooctanesulfonamide;vapor pressure;perfluoroalkyl derivative;ester derivative;methacrylic acid derivative;trifluoroacetic acid;partition coefficient;octanol;dimethyl sulfoxide;high throughput screening;scoring system;alkane derivative;volatilization;amine;trifluoromethanesulfonic acid;boiling point;melting point;water solubility;polyfluoroalkyl derivative;Computer Simulation;fluorotelomer sulfonic acid;High-throughput screening;perfluoro 3;6 dioxaoctane 18 dioic acid;6 dioxaoctaneperfluoro 3;acrylic acid derivative;alkene;amide;Chemical quality;Dimethyl Sulfoxide;excipient;Excipients;hexafluoroglutaric acid;hexafluoroglutaryl chloride;High-Throughput Screening Assays;hydroxylation;In vitro toxicity testing;New approach methods;octafluoroadipic acid;perfluoropentanamide;polyether derivative;silane derivative;tetrafluorosuccinic acid,NA,NA

However, no systematic elucidation of local PFASs sources has been conducted yet. Therefore, a survey was performed aiming at identifying local PFAS pollution sources on the island of Spitsbergen (Svalbard, Norway). Soil, freshwater (lake, draining rivers), seawater, meltwater run-off, surface snow and coastal sediment samples were collected from Longyearbyen (Norwegian mining town), Ny-Ålesund (research facility) and the Lake Linnévatnet area (background site) during several campaigns (2014–2016) and analysed for 14 individual target PFASs. For background site (Linnévatnet area, sampling during April to June 2015), ΣPFAS levels ranged from 0.4 to 4 ng/L in surface lake water (n = 20). PFAS in meltwater from the contributing glaciers showed similar concentrations ( 4 ng/L, n = 2). The short-chain perfluorobutanoate (PFBA) was predominant in lake water (60–80% of the ΣPFASs), meltwater (20–30%) and run-off water (40%). Long-range transport is assumed to be the major PFAS source. In Longyearbyen, five water samples (i.e. 2 seawater, 3 run-off) were collected near the local firefighting training site (FFTS) in November 2014 and June 2015, respectively. The highest PFAS levels were found in FFTS meltwater run-off (118 ng/L). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was the most abundant compound in the FFTS meltwater run-off (53–58% PFASs). At the research station Ny-Ålesund, seawater (n = 6), soil (n = 9) and freshwater (n = 10) were collected in June 2016. Low ΣPFAS concentrations were determined for seawater (5–6 ng/L), whereas high ΣPFAS concentrations were found in run-off water (113–119 ng/L) and soil (211–800 ng/g dry weight (dw)) collected close to the local FFTS. In addition, high ΣPFAS levels (127 ng/L) were also found in freshwater from lake Solvatnet close to former sewage treatment facility. Overall, at both FFTS-affected sites (soil, water), PFOS was the most abundant compound (60–69% of ΣPFASs).

The total PFCs concentration was 164 to 299ngL-1 in water and 5.8 to 35ngg-1 (dw) in sediment. The highest concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) in water were 29.2ngL-1 and 136ngL-1. PFOS was largely associated with sediment, whereas short chain PFCs predominated in water. The partition coefficient (Kd) was positively correlated with the organic carbon fraction (fhookoc) for PFOS but not for the other PFCs. The organic carbon normalized partition coefficient (Koc) increased by 0.51 log units for each additional CF2 moiety from perfluoro-butanesulfonate (PFBS) to PFOS. For the same chain length but different functional groups, the log Koc of PFOS was 1.35 units higher than PFOA. PFOS exhibited the highest affinity for sediment through the partition mechanism, and fhookoc affected the sediment as a sink of PFOS. Although there was no immediate health impact by the intake of the water alone, the consumption of aquatic products may cause potential health risks for animals/humans on the time scale of months to years.

The present study investigated the neuro-dopamine (DA) and cellular steroid hormone homeostasis of wild Bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from a skiing area in Norway (Trondheim), in relation to tissue concentrations of PFAS. We found a positive association between brain DA concentrations and the concentration of several PFAS, while there was a negative association between PFAS and dopamine receptor 1 (dr1) mRNA. The ratio between DA and its metabolites (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid: DOPAC and homovanillic acid: HVA) showed a negative association between DOPAC/DA and several PFAS, suggesting that PFAS altered the metabolism of DA via monoamine oxidase (Mao). This assumption is supported by an observed negative association between mao mRNA and PFAS. Previous studies have shown that DA homeostasis can indirectly regulate cellular estrogen (E2) and testosterone (T) biosynthesis.

In the surface water, the total concentration of PFASs ranged in 1193–3462 ng L−1 (mean 1734 ng L−1) in the rainy season and 469–1724 ng L−1 (mean 876 ng L−1) in the dry season. The total concentration of PFASs in the sediment ranged in 1.97–13.3 ng g−1 (mean 6.53 ng g−1). It was found that PFCAs and PFSAs with longer chains were more easily adsorbed in the sediment. Among the collected fish samples, the enrichment of PFASs in the tissues fell in the order of liver > cheek > muscle. For the muscle, stomach, and liver tissues of the fish samples, significant correlations existed between the δ15N values and the concentration of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).

To find the cause of the conflicting data, this study examined the influence of chemical speciation on the toxicity of representative PFAAs, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorobutane carboxylic acid (PFBA), and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). Zebrafish embryos were acutely exposed to PFAA, PFAA salt, and a pH-negative control, after which the developmental impairment and mechanisms were explored. The results showed that PFAAs were generally more toxic than the corresponding pH control, indicating that the embryonic toxicity of PFAAs was mainly caused by the pollutants themselves. In contrast to the high toxicity of PFAAs, PFAA salts only exhibited mild hazards to zebrafish embryos. Fingerprinting the changes along the thyroidal axis demonstrated distinct modes of endocrine disruption for PFAAs and PFAA salts. Furthermore, biolayer interferometry monitoring found that PFOA and PFBS acids bound more strongly with albumin proteins than did their salts. Accordingly, the acid of PFAAs accumulated significantly higher concentrations than their salt counterparts. The present findings highlight the importance of chemical forms to the outcome of developmental toxicity, calling for the discriminative risk assessment and management of PFAAs and salts. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.3c06178,Biochemistry;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Article;concentration (parameter);liothyronine;nonhuman;thyroxine;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;perfluoro compound;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;adult;risk assessment;Risk assessment;toxicity;Toxicity;developmental toxicity;embryo;carboxylic acid;endocrine disruptor;animal cell;animal model;zebra fish;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;pH;embryotoxicity;albumin;perflubutane;Endocrine disrupters;Developmental toxicity;phenanthrene;Endocrine disruption;interferometry;'current;Zebrafish embryos;Acid salts;albumin binding;Albumin bindings;chemical speciation;Chemical speciation;dual polarization interferometry;larval development;perflubutane carboxylic acid;perfluoroalkyl acids;Perfluorobutane;Philadelphia chromosome negative cell;Salts;short term exposure;speciation (chemistry);thyroidal endocrine disruption;Thyroidal endocrine disruption,NA,NA

Aqueous film forming foam used in firefighting, wastewater effluent, landfill leachate, and biosolids are major sources of PFAS input to soil and groundwater. Remediation of PFAS contaminated solid and aqueous media is challenging, which is attributed to the chemical and thermal stability of PFAS and the complexity of PFAS mixtures. In this review, remediation of PFAS contaminated soils through manipulation of their bioavailability and destruction is presented. While the mobilizing amendments (e.g., surfactants) enhance the mobility and bioavailability of PFAS, the immobilizing amendments (e.g., activated carbon) decrease their bioavailability and mobility. Mobilizing amendments can be applied to facilitate the removal of PFAS though soil washing, phytoremediation, and complete destruction through thermal and chemical redox reactions. Immobilizing amendments are likely to reduce the transfer of PFAS to food chain through plant and biota (e.g., earthworm) uptake, and leaching to potable water sources. Future studies should focus on quantifying the potential leaching of the mobilized PFAS in the absence of removal by plant and biota uptake or soil washing, and regular monitoring of the long-term stability of the immobilized PFAS.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123892,"Messenger;Poly A-U;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Polyglactin 910;Polymethyl Methacrylate;RNA;RNA, Messenger",NA,NA

It is a spatial carrier of important transportation and trade infrastructure, which is of great ecological, economic and social significance. With the rapid industrialization and urbanization, the dense population in coastal areas and the frequent exchange of matter and energy make coastal ecosystems extremely sensitive and vulnerable to climate change and pollution. Due to the combined effects of human activities and climate change, emerging ecological problems have caused the decline of coastal water quality, the decrease of coastal biodiversity, and the change of biological community structure. At the same time, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been widely found in coastal zones around the world. As a series of man⁃ made persistent organic compounds, PFASs were proved to have potential developmental toxicity, immune toxicity, and reproductive toxicity. They are difficult to degrade in the natural environment, and can accumulate and amplify in marine organisms along the food chain, posing a health risk to humans. With the rapid development of fluorinated chemical industry in China, the continuous replacement of new type of PFASs together with the aggravation of climate change, the impact of PFASs on coastal ecosystem is facing great uncertainty. It is of vital importance to maintain the sustainable management of the coastal marine ecosystem by improving legislation, carrying out nationwide monitoring of PFASs, controlling over pollutants discharge, and establishing an integrated coastal zone management mechanism. © 2022 Science Press.

We estimated that the mega fluorochemical industrial park (FIP) in Shandong, China, had emitted a maximum of 5040 kg and 1026 kg of hexafluoropropylene oxides (HFPOs), and 7560 kg and 1890 kg of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to water and air during 2021. In the surface water, groundwater, outdoor dust, soil, tree leaf and bark collected in the vicinity of the FIP, PFOA was predominant, followed by HFPOs. The much higher percentage of HFPO dimer acid (HFPO-DA) in groundwater than in surface water verified that this compound was more mobile in porous media. The strong correlations between the main PFASs in outdoor dust and surface soil suggested that the soil PFASs were mainly derived from air deposition, particularly for HFPO trimer acid (HFPO-TA), which has a stronger binding affinity with particles than PFOA. High percentage of the hydroxylated product of 6:2 polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid was observed in groundwater, implying reductive dechlorination might occur in groundwater. Strong correlations between PFASs in outdoor dust and those in tree leaf and bark magnified that tree could serve as a sampler to effectively monitor airborne PFASs.

The levels of up to twelve EPA priority PFASs were measured in surface waters and biota from March–November 2019. PFASs levels in surface waters showed mean total levels in March and April 2019 to be from 4× to 300× higher than those measured in the following months. PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) was the most abundant homolog measured at ≥66% of total PFASs. Maximal PFOS levels exceeded the State of Texas' water regulatory limit of 0.6 μg L−1 in 3% of the samples analyzed in March and April 2019. PFOS was also the most prominent homolog (≥66% of total PFASs) measured in eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus). A statistically significant elevation of PFOS body-burdens was measured in oysters and spotted seatrout in April and May 2019, respectively. A Hazard Ratio calculation for seafood safety suggests an advisory of 1–2 meals per week for gafftopsail catfish and red drum, and 2 meals per week for spotted seatrout to be protective for human exposure to PFOS.

In bream fillet, concentrations were lower (<0.5-10.6 mu g kg(-1) Sigma PFAS). Contamination of suspended particulate matter (SPM) was highest in the upper Elbe downstream the Czech border (5.5 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (dw) in 2018). Herring gull eggs from the North and Baltic Seas showed Sigma PFAS levels around 53.0-69.6 mu g kg(-1) ww in 2019. In soil, concentrations ranged between <0.5 and 4.6 mu g kg(-1) dw with highest levels in the Dueben Heath near Leipzig and the low mountain range Solling. PFOS dominated in most samples. Of the targeted precursors, only FOSA, EtFOSAA, MeFOSAA, 6:2-FtS and 6:2 diPAP were found. Replacement chemicals (ADONA, HFPO-DA, F-53B) were not detected. The dTOP assay revealed that considerable amounts of precursors were present at most riverine sampling sites. Particularly high precursor concentrations were observed in samples from the Upper Elbe at the Czech border and the Upper and Middle Rhine. In herring gull eggs and most soil samples, though, concentrations of precursors were low. Time trend analysis showed decreasing trends for most detected PFAS since 2005. In SPM, however, C4-C6 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids seem to increase indicating growing use of precursors based on shorter fluorinated chains. The results demonstrate that target analysis detects only a minor fraction of the PFAS burdens in environmental samples.

While its health risks remain unknown, there is preliminary evidence of developmental toxicity. In the present study, human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) were used to evaluate the effects of Cl-PFESA at non-cytotoxic concentrations on molecular regulation and cellular function of stem cells compared to PFOS, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Gene profiles of hBMSCs exposed to 100 nM of Cl-PFESA and the other 3 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) correlated significantly with each other. A total of 261 genes were found to be affected by all 4 compounds. Functional annotation analysis revealed that osteoblast differentiation, ERK1/2, TGFβ and calcium signalling were interfered. Moreover, DUSP mRNA and P-SMAD protein, key factors in ERK and TGFβ/SMAD signaling, were decreased by Cl-PFESA. Furthermore, intracellular calcium image suggested that calcium transients were enhanced by Cl-PFESA with lower effective concentrations and more prolonged induction than PFOS and PFHxS. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that the stemness marker CD44 was dose-dependently repressed by Cl-PFESA.

In this study, water, sediment, and biological samples (fish and plant) were collected from Tangxun Lake, which is located near a production base of the fluorochemical industry in Wuhan, China. Perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were the predominant PFAAs in surface water, with average concentrations of 3660 ng/L and 4770 ng/L, respectively. However, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most abundant PFAA in sediments, with an average concentration of 74.4 ng/g dw. The organic carbon normalized distribution coefficients (KOC) indicated that short-chain PFAAs (CF2 < 7) tended to have lower adsorption potentials than PFOS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and longer perfluoroalkyl chain compounds. PFBS and PFBA could transport to a farther distance in the horizontal direction along the water flow and infiltrate into deeper depths in the vertical direction. However, levels of PFOS and PFOA in water dropped exponentially along the current, and their proportions were decreased gradually with the increasing depth in sediment cores. Furthermore, values of log bioconcentration factor (BCF) of the short-chain PFAAs were all relatively low (<1), indicating no bioaccumulation potentials for short-chain PFAAs in aquatic species. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/es402120y,Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;Adsorption;nonhuman;controlled study;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;alkyl group;perfluoro compound;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);adsorption;article;lake;Lakes;Carps;organic compound;lake water;Average concentration;Geologic Sediments;organic carbon;Chains;sediment core;surface water;biogeochemistry;Perfluoroalkyl chains;Bioconcentration factor;lacustrine deposit;lake sediment;Distribution coefficient;Hubei;Tangxun Lake;Bioaccumulation potential;Adsorption potential;Eichhornia;Lotus;Wuhan,NA,NA

Earlier studies of the geographical distribution of PFCs focused primarily on the Northern Hemisphere, while little attention was paid to the Southern Hemisphere. In this study, livers from eight species of albatrosses, blood from elephant seal, and blood and eggs from penguins and polar skua collected from the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic during 1995-2005 were analyzed for 10 PFCs. In addition, for comparison with the Southern Ocean samples, we analyzed liver, sera, and eggs from two species of albatrosses from Midway Atoll in the North Pacific Ocean. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were found in livers of albatrosses from the Southern Ocean. PFOS was the major contaminant, although the concentrations were <5 ng/g, wet wt, in 92% of the albatross livers analyzed. PFOA was detected in 30% of the albatross livers, with a concentration range of <0.6-2.45 ng/g, wet wt. Other PFCs, including long-chain perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs), were below the limits of quantitation in livers of albatrosses from the Southern Ocean. In liver, sera, and eggs of albatrosses from the North Pacific Ocean, long-chain PFCAs (perfluorononanoate, perfluorodecanoate, perfluoroundecanoate, and perfluorododecanoate) were found at concentrations similar to those of PFOS and PFOA. The mean concentration of PFOS in livers of Laysan albatrosses from the North Pacific Ocean (5.1 ng/g, wet wt) was higher than that in several species of albatrosses from the Southern Ocean (2.2 ng/g, wet wt). Species-specific differences in the concentrations of PFOS were noted among Southern Ocean albatrosses, whereas geographical differences in PFOS concentrations among the Indian Ocean, South Pacific Ocean, and South Atlantic Ocean were insignificant. Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were, respectively, 2- and 17-fold higher in liver than in sera of Laysan albatrosses. PFOS was found in the blood of elephant seals from Antarctica at concentrations ranging from <0.08 to 3.52 ng/mL PFOS was found in eggs (2.1-3.1 ng/g) and blood (<0.24-1.4 ng/ mL) of polar skuas but was not detected in penguins from Antarctica.

These properties also make PFAS highly persistent and mobile across various environmental compartments, leading to bioaccumulation, and causing acute ecotoxicity at all trophic levels particularly to human populations, thus increasing the need for monitoring at their repositories or usage sites. In this review, current nano-enabled methods towards PFAS sensing and its monitoring in wastewater are critically discussed and benchmarked against conventional detection methods. The discussion correlates the materials' properties to the sensitivity, responsiveness, and reproducibility of the sensing performance for nano-enabled sensors in currently explored electrochemical, spectrophotometric, colorimetric, optical, fluorometric, and biochemical with limits of detection of 1.02 × 10<sup>−6</sup> μg/L, 2.8 μg/L, 1 μg/L, 0.13 μg/L, 6.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup> μg/L, and 4.141 × 10<sup>−7</sup> μg/L respectively. The cost-effectiveness of sensing platforms plays an important role in the on-site analysis success and upscalability of nano-enabled sensors. Environmental monitoring of PFAS is a step closer to PFAS remediation. Electrochemical and biosensing methods have proven to be the most reliable tools for future PFAS sensing endeavors with very promising detection limits in an aqueous matrix, short detection times, and ease of fabrication.

Therefore, accurate methods for determining and quantifying ECs in surface water are essential for estimating their environmental impact. This work describes the development, validation and application of a sensitive multiclass method for simultaneous determination of 22 per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs), 3 pharmaceuticals, 15 pesticides, and 2 bisphenols in surface water using on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). The method allows simultaneous sample clean-up from interfering matrices and lower limits of detection (LODs) by injecting a large sample volume into the LC system without compromising chromatographic efficiency and resolution. Linearity of response over several orders of magnitude was demonstrated for all tested compounds (R2 > 0.99), with the LODs ranging from 0.8 and 33.7 pg mL−1, allowing detection of ECs at trace levels in surface water. The method showed acceptable accuracy and precision (CV, % and RE below 20%) for all tested ECs. It also provided recoveries between 60% and 130% for all tested ECs. The validated method was successfully applied for analysis of surface water samples from three rivers (Cam, Ouse and Thames) in England.

This study examines the American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis, as an important indicator of ecosystem contamination and a potential pathway for PFAA exposure in humans. Alligator meat harvested in the 2015 South Carolina (SC) public hunt season and prepared for human consumption was collected and analyzed for PFAAs to determine meat concentrations and relationships with animal body size (total length), sex, and location of harvest. Of the 15 PFAAs analyzed, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was found in all alligator meat samples and at the highest concentrations (median 6.73 ng/g). No relationship was found between PFAA concentrations and total length or sex. Concentrations of one or all compounds varied significantly across sampling locations, with alligators harvested in the Middle Coastal hunt unit having the highest PFOS concentrations (median 16.0 ng/g; p = 0.0001). Alligators harvested specifically from Berkley County, SC (located in the Middle Coastal hunt unit) had the highest PFOS concentrations and the greatest number of PFAAs detected (p < 0.0001).

The specific Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System (HS)) codes of imported and exported goods that possibly contain PFOS and 165 of Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) numbers of PFOS-related substances were assessed for acquiring information from customs and other authorities. However, with the current approaches available, no useful information could be compiled since HS codes are not specific enough and CAS numbers are not used by customs. Furthermore, the cut-off volume in chemical databases in Turkey and the reporting limit in the HS system (0.1 %) are too high for controlling PFOS. The attempt of modeling imported volumes by a Monte Carlo simulation did not also result in a satisfactory estimate, giving an upper-bound estimate above the global production volumes. The replies to questionnaires were not satisfactory, highlighting that an elaborated approach is needed in the communication with potentially PFOS-using stakeholders.

However, the intrinsic characteristic of pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) limited their application for removing PFOA from aqueous medium. Therefore, three nano-metals (nano-crystalline iron, copper and zinc) grafted MWCNTs were synthesized and characterized by BET-N2, TEM, FTIR, XPS and XRD as well as MWCNTs (as the control treatment) in this study. The results showed that nano metals were well grafted on the surface of MWCNTs. Adsorption were investigated by using radioactive labeled PFOA (14C-PFOA) to quantify the trace PFOA. Adsorption kinetics showed the adsorption of PFOA on the metal doped MWCNTs (MDCNTs) was controlled by intra-particle diffusion. Adsorption isotherms showed the sorption amounts on the MDCNTs were higher than the control. This attributed much to the hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction and the formation of the inner sphere complexes. Ionic strength (0-100 mM) and ionic species (Ca2+) had little effects on the sorption of MDCNTs. PFOA adsorption on MDCNTs strongly depended on pH value in the medium.

Mean ∑PFAS concentrations varied from 12.7 to 33.0 ng/g wet weight (ww) in whole fish and 6.2–12.7 ng/g ww in fillets. For individual whole fish, ∑PFASs ranged from 12.7 ng/g ww in striped mullet to 85.4 ng/g ww in spotted seatrout, and in fillets individual values ranged from 6.2 ng/g ww in striped mullet to 27.9 ng/g ww in spot. The most abundant compound in each species was perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), comprising 25.5–69.6% of the ∑PFASs. Striped mullet had significantly lower relative amounts of PFOS compared to all other species and higher relative amounts of PFUnDA compared to Atlantic croaker, spotted seatrout, and spot. Unlike whole fish, PFAS levels in fillets varied significantly by location with higher ∑PFOS from the Ashley River than the Cooper River and Charleston Harbor, which reflects the levels of PFASs contamination in these systems. In whole fish, differences in relative concentrations of PFOS, PFNA, and PFDA occurred by capture location, suggestive of different sources. PFOS concentrations for southern flounder and spotted seatrout fillets were within the advisory range to limit fish consumption to 4 meals a month.

PFAS exposure resulting from aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) ingestion is poorly understood due to the complexity of AFFF mixtures and the presence of polyfluorinated substances that may undergo metabolic transformation. C57BL/6 mice were dosed with an AFFF primarily containing electrochemically fluorinated PFASs for 10 days, followed by a 6 day depuration. Urine was collected throughout the study and serum was collected post-depuration. Samples were analyzed via high-resolution mass spectrometry. Relative to the dosing solution, C6 and C7 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) were enriched in dosed mouse serum, suggesting in vivo transformation of sulfonamide precursors. Some substituted C8 PFSAs [keto-perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), hydrogen-PFOS, and unsaturated PFOS] appeared to be more bioaccumulative than linear PFOS, or were formed in vivo from unidentified precursors. A series of seven peaks in dosed mouse serum was tentatively identified as sulfonimide dimers that were either a minor component of the AFFF or were formed via metabolism of other AFFF components. This work highlights the importance of sulfonamide precursors in contributing to bioaccumulation of AFFF-associated PFSAs and identifies several classes of potentially bioaccumulative novel PFASs that warrant further investigation.

Due to the strong persistency and water and lipid repellency, PFAS have been used in a wide range of industrial processes and consumer products. The widespread use of PFAS leads to a continuous diffuse environmental and human exposure. PFAS have been used in fluorocarbon-based ski waxes since the 1980s and the chemical composition is continuously evolving. When the skis are being used, the wax will abrade from the ski sole, and be distributed in the environment. This can potentially lead to PFAS hot spots near ski resorts and ski tracks. The aim of the current thesis was to investigate the environmental and biota occurrence, distribution, and toxicological effects of PFAS from ski products, studying a local environment and rodents near a ski arena. Soil-, earthworm- (Eisenia fetida) and bank vole (Myodes glareolus) samples were collected from a Norwegian skiing area (Granåsen, Trondheim, Norway) and from a reference area with no skiing activities (Jonsvatnet, Trondheim, Norway). PFAS concentrations and composition (referred to as PFAS profile) were analyzed and compared with previous studies on commercial fluorinated ski waxes. Possible PFAS-related effects on the dopaminergic and steroid hormone systems and relative liver weight (hepatosomatic index; HSI) in the wild bank voles were also investigated. These results were further reproduced in a controlled laboratory exposure study using A/J mice (Mus musculus). The summarized PFAS concentrations (∑PFAS) were significantly higher in bank voles from the skiing area compared to the reference area, and 35% higher in earthworms from the skiing area, compared to the reference area. The PFAS profile in samples from the skiing area resembled that of the previously analyzed commercial ski waxes, dominated by long-chained PFAS, while the samples from the reference area were dominated by short-chained PFAS.

However, PFAS concentrations in water treatment residuals (WTRs)—a solid by-product of water treatment—have yet to be explored. In a first of its kind assessment, we examine PFAS occurrence in seven calcium (Ca)-, iron-, and aluminum-based drinking water treatment residuals (DWTRs) and one wastewater effluent treatment residual (WWETR) produced using aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH). Only perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were detected, with total PFAA concentrations in the seven DWTRs produced from naturally recharged water sources ranging from 0 to ∼3.3 μg kg−1; no PFAS were detected in either of the Ca-DWTRs. The ACH-WWETR contained the highest number and concentration of PFAAs (34 μg kg−1). Desorption of resident PFAAs from the WTRs was negligible for the carboxylates (PFCAs). Some desorption of the sulfonates (PFSAs) was detected, particularly for PFOS which had the highest concentration among all resident PFAAs. The ACH-WWETR was further evaluated for its potential to attenuate additional PFAAs (3500 μg mL−1 total PFAAs) in a biosolid-derived porewater matrix. Sorption was highest for long-chain PFAAs and subsequent desorption of the adsorbed PFAAs ranged from 0% to no more than 26%, with the WWETR mass added strongly affecting both PFSA and PFCA sorption/desorption. These findings suggest that WTRs, if introduced into the environment, are unlikely to be a major source of PFAS. Also, the use of particular WTRs as amendments may provide a beneficial reduction in PFAS mobility. © 2023 The Authors.

However, after use, most of the chemicals and their derivatives end up in soil and water, interacting with living organisms. Plants, which are primary producers, are intentionally or unintentionally exposed to several chemicals, serving as a vehicle for the transfer of products into the food chain. Although the exposure of pesticides towards plants has been witnessed over a long time in agricultural production, other chemicals have attracted attention very recently. In this review, we carried out a comprehensive overview of the plant uptake capacity of various contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) in soil, such as pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated compounds, pharmaceutical and personal care products, and engineered nanomaterials. The uptake pathways and overall impacts of these chemicals are highlighted. According to the literature, bioaccumulation of CEC in the root part is higher than in aerial parts. Furthermore, various factors such as plant species, pollutant type, and microbial interactions influence the overall uptake.

Many seabird species are long-lived top predators thus exhibit high contaminant levels, and PFAS-disrupting effects on their physiology have been documented especially in relation to the endocrine system in adults. On the contrary, studies on the developmental period (i.e., chicks), during which exposure to environmental contaminants may have a greater impact on physiological traits, remain scarce to this date. We carried out a multi-species study with the aim to assess whether and to which extent chicks of four gull species (herring gull, great and lesser black-backed gull, yellow-legged gull) in South Western France are contaminated by PFAS, and to bring further evidence about their potential physiological consequences. Linear PFOS showed concentrations of concern as it was generally >10 times higher than the other PFAS, and exceeded a threshold toxicity level (calculated from previous studies in birds) in almost all sampled chicks. Nonetheless, in herring gull male chicks, total T3 levels were significantly and negatively associated with perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and perfluorododecanoate (PFDoDA) and positively associated with perfluorotetradecanoate (PFTeDA) in female chicks. Total T3 levels were also positively associated with PFDoDA in great black backed gull male chicks and with perfluorotridecanoate (PFTrDA) in lesser black backed gull chicks. In lesser and great black-backed gulls, both females and males showed significant negative associations between several PFAS and their body condition, and a positive association between telomere length and L-PFOS in the yellow-legged gull was also found.

While planetary ball mill have been shown successful degradation of PFAS, there are issues surrounding scale up (maximum size is typically 0.5 L cylinders). While having lower energy outputs, horizontal ball mills, for which scale up is not a limiting factor, already exist at commercial/industrial sizes from the mining, metallurgic and agricultural industries, which could be re-purposed. This study evaluated the effectiveness of horizontal ball mills in degrading perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTSA), and aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) spiked on nepheline syenite sand. Horizontal ball milling was also applied to two different soil types (sand dominant and clay dominant) collected from a firefighting training area (FFTA). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to track 21 target PFAS throughout the milling process. High-resolution accurate mass spectrometry was also used to identify the presence and degradation of 19 non-target fluorotelomer substances, including 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamido betaine (FtSaB), 7:3 fluorotelomer betaine (FtB), and 6:2 fluorotelomer thioether amido sulfonate (FtTAoS). In the presence of potassium hydroxide (KOH), used as a co-milling reagent, PFOS, 6:2 FTSA, and the non-target fluorotelomer substances in the AFFF were found to undergo upwards of 81%, 97%, and 100% degradation, respectively. Despite the inherent added complexity associated with field soils, better PFAS degradation was observed on the FFTA soils over the spiked NSS, and more specifically, on the FFTA clay over the FFTA sand.

Short-chain and emerging PFAS were predominant in surface water and sediments, rather than legacy perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer/trimer acid (HFPO-DA/TA), 6:2 and 8:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acids (6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFESAs), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS), and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS) were detected in all samples, indicating that these emerging PFAS have been widely produced and used in this region. The high concentrations of HFPO-DA/TA, 6:2 FTS, 6:2, 8:2 Cl-PFESAs, and OBS in sediments and their higher water–sediment distribution coefficients than those of predecessors (PFOA or PFOS) suggest that lake sediments could be an important long-term sink for these emerging alternatives.

In the aftermath of the derailment accident, the emergency response entailed the deployment of 33 000 L of aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) concentrate that contained proprietary fluorosurfactants. The present study examines the environmental occurrence of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and newly identified per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the benthic fish white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) and sediments from Lake Mégantic and Chaudière River. In sediments, PFAAs displayed relatively low concentrations (ΣPFAAs = 0.06-0.5 ng g-1 dw) while the sum of fluorotelomer-based PFASs was in the range < LOD-6.2 ng g-1 dw. Notably, fluorotelomer sulfonamide betaines (8:2-FTAB and 10:2-FTAB), fluorotelomer betaines (9:3-FTB, 11:3-FTB and 9:1:2 FTB) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2-FTSA) were ubiquitously identified in the sediment samples surveyed. Levels of PFAAs remained moderate in fish muscle (e.g., PFOS: 0.28-2.1 ng g-1 wet-weight), with little or no differences when comparing 2013 or 2014 fish samples with 2011 archived samples. In contrast, n:2-FTSAs emerged in the immediate weeks or months that followed the accident, as did several betaine-based PFASs (8:2-FTAB, 10:2-FTAB, 9:3-FTB, 11:3-FTB, 7:1:2 FTB and 9:1:2 FTB), observed for the first time in situ. Fluorotelomer thioether amido sulfonate (10:2-FTSAS) and fluorotelomer sulfoxide amido sulfonate (10:2-FTSAS-sulfoxide) were also occasionally reported after the AFFF spill. With time, levels of betaine-based PFASs gradually decreased in fish, possibly indicating attenuation by biodegradation of the fluorine-free moiety, supported by the observation of likely metabolites such as n:3-fluorotelomer carboxylates and n:2-fluorotelomer sulfonamides.

Lower concentrations of C8-C12 perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) were detected in comparison with concentrations measured previously in an ice core from the Canadian Arctic, indicating that contamination levels in the European Arctic are lower. Average PFAS concentrations were found to be lower in surface snow and melted glacier water samples, while increased concentrations were observed in river water downstream near the coastal area.

In the present study, a non-targeted workflow (suspect screening) was developed to investigate plastic-related chemicals and other environmental contaminants in a top predator freshwater fish species, the northern pike, from the St. Lawrence River, Canada. Samples were extracted using sonication-assisted liquid extraction and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS). Ten bisphenol compounds were used to test the analytical performances of the method, and satisfactory results were obtained in terms of instrumental linearity (r2 > 0.97), recoveries, (86.53–119.32%), inter-day precision and method detection limits. The non-targeted workflow data processing parameters were studied, and the peak height filters (peak filtering step) were found to influence significantly the capacity to detect and identify trace chemicals in pike muscle extracts. None of the ten bisphenol analogues were detected in pike extracts suggesting the absence of accumulation for these chemicals in pike muscle. However, the non-targeted workflow enabled the identification of diethyl phthalate (DEP) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in pike extracts.

Acetonitrile was used as the extraction solvent with solid phase extraction weak anion-exchange (SPE-WAX) clean up, with LC-MS/MS analysis using both surrogate and performance standards to correct for losses during sample preparation and matrix effects. The method has been evaluated in four different matrices (fish, pizza, chicken nuggets and spinach). Originally, the focus was to develop a method for foods commonly thought to be a source of PFASs (e.g. fish). It was expanded to include foods where PFAS exposure would be possible through their presence in grease-proof food packaging (e.g. pizza, chicken nuggets). Vegetables (lettuce) and fruit (tomato) have recently been considered as part of proficiency testing programmes, so the inclusion of some testing in a vegetable matrix (i.e. spinach) was also added to the testing. Limits of quantification ranged from 0.018 ng g−1 (L-PFDS) to 5.28 ng g−1 (FHEA), although method quantification limits for PFBA (12.4 ng g−1), 6:2 PAP (8.96 ng g−1) and 8:2 PAP (3.49 ng g−1) were elevated above instrumental limits owing to their consistent detection in reagent blank samples. PFAS analyses were strongly impacted by matrix, therefore the use of isotopically labelled internal standards was critical to the development of accurate results. The accuracy of the method using numerous proficiency testing schemes or interlaboratory comparison studies has shown the developed method to be successful with z-scores for all concerned analytes in all test matrices remaining within ±2.0, with the exception of PFBA in wheat flour which was −2.4. © 2022 The Author(s).

Thus, there is growing concern about whether fish consumption can cause PFAS-associated health impacts on humans since fish is a vital protein source for global populations. Here, we assess the potential driving factors of fish consumption by analysing the aquaculture, demographic and socio-economic data across 31 provinces/municipalities in China, followed by estimating the health risk of PFAS via fish consumption. We found that per capita fish consumption was primarily driven by fish production and total area for freshwater aquaculture, while urbanization rate and median age of consumers were also important. The health risk of PFAS was low (hazard quotient <1) in most provinces, while urban consumers were more prone to PFAS than rural consumers across all provinces. Since PFAS have been phased out worldwide, their health risk to humans through fish consumption would be lower than previously thought. To reduce PFAS intake for the high-risk populations, we recommend that fish should be well cooked before consumption, preferably using water-based cooking methods, and that alternative protein sources should be consumed more as the substitute for fish. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170960,Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;China;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;food contamination;bioaccumulation;Health risks;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;fish;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;urbanization;Risk assessment;human;water;polyfluoroalkyl substance;food safety;health hazard;food consumption;cooking;Cooking;health risk;Risk perception;Fishes;Health risk;Proteins;polymer;fresh water;high risk population;Water;Fresh Water;aquaculture;Fish consumption;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances;Aquaculture;fish consumption;rural population;Comprehensive analysis;Driving factors;Global population;Health impact;health risk assessment;Human consumption;Protein sources;urban population,NA,NA

Mussels were exposed to concentrations of 1 μgL-1 and 10 μgL-1 of each PFC for 56 days, and the bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were found to range from 15 to 859 L/kg and from 12 to 473 L/kg at 1 μgL-1 and 10 μgL-1, respectively. For all compounds, the BAF was larger at the lower dosage. Results suggest that the bioaccumulation of PFCs is concentration dependent. This concentration dependency can be explained by a nonlinear adsorption mechanism, which was further supported by the experimental results. The sensitivity of BAF to exposure concentration was found to be positively related to perfluorinated chain length and the binding affinity of the compounds. Bioaccumulation of long chain carboxylates and sulfonates are more easily affected by concentration changes. The validity of the conventional kinetic method was examined by comparing the results with the fundamental steady-state method: in addition to the above-mentioned batch test, mussels were also subject to 24-day exposure (1 μgL-1 and 10 μgL-1) followed by 24-day depuration.

In addition, the discovery of new PFAS alternatives in the environment has led to growing concern about the presence of numerous other PFAS that are used unrestricted. Feathers have been successfully applied as non-destructive indicators for various contaminants, mostly metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), whereas their suitability as an indicator for PFAS is still discussed. Previous studies on PFAS in feathers have focused primarily on perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs); analytical methods for other groups of PFAS or PFAS alternatives in feathers are still lacking. Hence, this study aimed to develop a rapid, sensitive and reliable analytical method for determining a broad range of PFAS (N = 32) in feathers, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). An extraction duration of 24 h was found to be sufficient to extract the majority of PFAS from the feathers. The extraction recovery of the internal standards ranged on average from 68% (PFBA) to 97% (PFOS). The spike recovery was within an acceptable range of at least 70% for most of the target analytes and the precision was often > 80%. A further extract clean-up using weak anion exchange (WAX) solid phase extraction (SPE), was proven unnecessary, as it resulted in a similar or lower spike recovery, and, as a consequence, a lower precision and higher quantification limit. The analytical method allows detection of low PFAS concentrations in a low quantity of matrix (i.e. small feathers).

Currently several methods are used for the quantification of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in biological matrices including different ways to correct for recovery losses, each with its specific pros and contras. With this paper we aim to re-evaluate current methodologies and to create an updated new analytical guideline that is applicable for both abiotic and biotic matrices. The developed LC/MS/MS method was validated and shown to be specific, selective, linear, robust and sensitive. Reliable results could still be obtained 6 days after extraction. The recoveries varied, depending on the matrix, between 1% and 100%, but nevertheless, a high accuracy was obtained even at the lowest recoveries. A reduction of sample mass could significantly increase method recoveries and therefore it is highly recommended to take less matrix. We confirmed that using the ISTD closest in terms of functional group and carbon chain length is a suitable method for the quantification of PFASs that lack a corresponding ISTD. The newly described method was, depending on the matrix, similar in terms of sensitivity and reliability compared to a frequently used method and could be used simultaneously in future monitoring studies. Therefore, we recommend to select the purification method based on the target analytes as well as the sample matrix.

The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation,""B"", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains (>7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than ""legacy"" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative.

PFAS are ubiquitously dispersed throughout the planet’s aquatic environments, soils and wildlife. Their environmental persistence, tendency to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in food webs coupled with negative health effects at elevated levels has resulted in them being commonly described as persistent organic pollutants. Although PFOS and other PFAS compounds have been subject to increasing scientific interest in the decades following their discovery, much remains unknown and uncertain in regards to their global and local transport mechanisms as well as their potential as environmental toxins. The objective of this study was to develop and validate an analytical method for the separation and determination of the individual PFOS isomers commonly found in environmental and technical samples, and attempt to quantitate them in biota samples from Svalbard, Norway. Collected samples from neighbouring levels of the food web at two different locations in the vicinity of Longyearbyen were analysed for the purpose of gaining insight into the levels of the individual PFOS-isomers, and changes happening to the isomer profile from one trophic level to the next. A new high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analytical method was designed by combining elements from other published studies. The method was used to separate four groups of PFOS isomers from a mixture and was applied to quantitate PFOS isomers in the biota samples. It was found that the total PFOS concentrations and the relative concentrations of L-PFOS in the biota samples increased with increasing trophic levels, in agreement with previous reports on the isomer’s greater bioaccumulation tendency. Fish liver samples from a reference station without any known nearby local PFOS pollution sources were discovered to have higher total PFOS levels than fish ...",NA,NA,character(0),NA,NA

However, limited information exists regarding current and historical emissions for the majority of PFASs under currently implemented regulations. This study employed suspect and nontarget screening to examine the temporal trends of legacy and unregulated PFASs in liver of the endangered beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) population from the St. Lawrence Estuary in Canada collected from 2000 to 2017. A suite of 54 PFASs were tentatively identified, and were grouped into nine structurally distinct classes. Single-hydrogenated perfluoro carboxylic acids (H-PFCAs), single-hydrogenated sulfonamides (H-Sulfonamides), as well as other select sulfonamides were detected for the first time in wildlife. Greater concentrations of the majority of PFASs were determined in newborns and juveniles than in adults, suggesting effective placental and lactational transfer of PFASs. Legacy per- A nd polyfluoroalkyl acids and perfluorooctane sulfonamide in beluga whale liver were found to significantly decrease in concentration between 2000 and 2017, while unregulated short-chain PFAS alternatives, H-PFCAs, and odd-chain FTCAs were found to increase over time. The implementation of suspect and nontarget screening revealed class-specific temporal trends of PFASs in SLE beluga whales, and supported continuous emissions of unregulated PFASs into the environment. ©",NA,10.1021/acs.est.0c05957,"Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;emerging contaminants;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctane sulfonamide;Sulfur compounds;Canada;Pregnancy;Amides;Hydrogenation;Infant;Newborn;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;controlled study;alkyl group;animal tissue;chemical substance;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;adult;liver tissue;human;newborn;carboxylic acid;placental transfer;pollution effect;Ontario [Canada];detection method;Estuaries;estuary;temporal analysis;sulfonamide;pregnancy;juvenile animal;beluga whale;endangered species;polymer;Water Pollutants;Cetacea;Delphinapterus leucas;whale;regulatory mechanism;screening;Chemical;Beluga Whale;Non-target screenings;suspect screening;high-resolution mass spectrometry;nontarget analysis;breastfeeding transmission;Continuous emission;Historical emissions;hydrogenation;Limited information;per- A nd polyfluoroalkyl substances;Saint Lawrence Islands National Park;RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins",NA,NA

However, within monitoring, contaminants are sometimes measured in a different tissue than the tissue for which the environmental (whole fish) or human (fillet (equivalent to muscle tissue)) quality standard is set. Tissue conversion factors (k), describing the relationship between concentrations in different tissues, can be used to obtain a quality standard for the appropriate tissue. Several different approaches have been suggested for the calculation of k. For monitoring purposes, we propose the use of a simple, easy reproducible approach that assumes proportionality between two tissue, or tissue and whole fish, concentrations. This allows for an easy comparison of studies and adoption of ks into independent monitoring programs. Here, we determined ks for three metals (mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd)) and nine per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) across six marine and freshwater fish species from Northern European lakes and the Baltic Sea. We found significant species differences for Hg for kmuscle/whole fish, for Cd and Pb for kliver/whole fish and for Cd for kliver/muscle. For perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA), we found a chain length dependence with lowest kliver/muscle at low and high chain lengths (C8, C13) and highest for median chain lengths (C9-C12). Further, there were differences between fish species with kliver/muscle for PFOS almost doubling from eelpout (10.3) to herring (19.2) and increasing up to a factor 4 between eelpout and herring for other PFASs. FOSA had two distinctive groups, herring with a kliver/muscle of 48.7 and a second group with ks of 2.3 to 5.9 for all other fish species. Our results suggest that differences in the tissue somatic index, and contaminant uptake, tissue transfer and metabolism result in the need for species-specific ks within monitoring. © 2022 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159740,PFAS;Fish;Humans;Baltic Sea;Animals;Article;Bioaccumulation;Mercury;animal;nonhuman;unclassified drug;biological monitoring;bioaccumulation;animal tissue;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;pollution monitoring;concentration (composition);perfluoroalkyl substance;Tissue;cadmium;human;lead;Environmental regulations;organofluorine derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;tissue distribution;mercury;mercury (element);Mercury (metal);Tissue engineering;metabolism;species difference;lake;Lakes;chemical structure;tissue metabolism;herring;Cadmium;Fishes;freshwater environment;Lead;environmental quality;Chain length;Monitoring;Quality control;freshwater fish;eel;Fish species;Fish tissue;Chains length;Contaminant distributions;Conversion factor;Conversion factors;Fish tissue contaminant distribution;Northern European;perfluoroalkylcarboxylic acid;Quality standard;thromboplastin;Thromboplastin;tissue conversion factor;Water conservation,NA,NA

The liver is the main target organ of PFOS exposure. Animal experiments have shown that PFOS exposure can increase the risk of liver tumorigenesis. However, whether PFOS can accelerate liver tumor progression is still unclear. In this study, transgenic zebrafish Tg (fabp10:rtTA2s-M2; TRE2:EGFP-KRAS(G12v)), a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model that can cause liver tumorigenesis by doxycycline (DOX) induction, was used to investigate the effect of PFOS exposure in HCC progression. The male kras(v12) transgenic zebrafish were exposed to 20 mg/L DOX, 500 mu g/L PFOS or combined 20 mg/L DOX and 500 mu g/L PFOS for 10 d. The results showed that co-treated with PFOS and DOX caused oncogenic Kras-induced liver enlargement, increased the percentages of zebrafish with HCC, and aggravated metabolic reprogramming of liver. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first proved that PFOS could promote liver tumor progression. Decreased vitamin D level and increased fatty acid intake caused by PFOS might be responsible for the tumor-promoting effects. The results suggest that attention should be paid to the tumor-promoting effects of PFOS when assessing its environmental health risks, and these findings provide new insights into the toxicity of PFOS.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2021.110962,Liver;Sulfones,NA,NA

However, how to remediate their contamination remains unclear. In this study, a heavily polluted lake, Baiyangdian Lake in China, was selected to investigate current PFASs levels in multimedia, stimulate their transport fate based upon an optimized fugacity model, and finally identify appropriate remediation pathways. From 2008–2019, the average concentrations of PFASs in the lake increased approximately 7–40 times in the environment and biota. Spatially, with continuous import of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), barring fish, a noticeable north-south difference was distinguished in the PFASs composition in multimedia from the lake. Based on the optimized fugacity model simulation, the water phase was the primary transport path ( 76.5%) for PFASs, with a total flux of 333 kg y-1. Compared with bioaccumulation fluxes in submerged plants (6.2 kg y-1), emerged plants (2.6 kg y-1), and fish (1.1 kg y-1), the exchange flux of PFASs between water and sediment remained high ( 94 kg y-1). Considering remediation cost, sediment cleaning is currently the most cost-effective pathway, while harvesting submerged plant could be a promising pathway in the future.

Microarray techniques of gene expression have become a powerful approach for exploring the biological effects of chemicals. Here, the Affymetrix, Inc. rat genome 230 2.0 GeneChip was used to identify alterations in gene regulation in Sprague-Dawley rats treated with five different concentrations of PFOA. Male rats were exposed by daily gavage to 1, 3, 5, 10, or 15 mg PFOA/kg, body weight (bw)/day for 21 days and at the end of the exposure, liver was isolated and total liver RNA were used for the gene chip analysis. Over 500 genes, whose expression was significantly (p < 0.0025) altered by PFOA at two-fold changes compared to control, were examined. The effects were dose-dependent with exposure to 10 mg PFOA/kg, bw/day, causing alteration in expression of the greatest number of genes (over 800). Approximately 106 genes and 38 genes were consistently up- or down-regulated, respectively, in all treatment groups. The largest categories of induced genes were those involved in transport and metabolism of lipids, particularly fatty acids. Other induced genes were involved in cell communication, adhesion, growth, apoptosis, hormone regulatory pathways, proteolysis and peptidolysis and signal transduction. The genes expression of which was suppressed were related to transport of lipids, inflammation and immunity, and especially cell adhesion.

Such a wide range is consistent with those reported in previous studies. The highest concentrations were reported in dams and crabs, followed by cod, tuna, pollock, tilapia, salmon, and shrimp. Technical perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) dominated the profile of the dam samples, which has been consistently found in other clam samples, especially in Asia. Long-chain PFCAs, specifically perfluoroundecanoic (PFUdA) and perfluorododecanoic (PFDoA), were the most frequently detected analytes across all seafood samples. The trends observed are comparable with those in the literature where benthic organisms tend to have the highest PFAS concentrations, followed by lean fish, fatty fish, and aquaculture.

Dietary exposures of aquatic-dependent birds were modeled for seven PFASs (PFHxA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFHxS, PFOS, and PFDS) using five different scenarios based on measurements of PFASs obtained from five investigations of sites historically-impacted by AFFF. Exposure modeling was conducted for four avian receptors representing various avian feeding guilds: lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularia), great blue heron (Ardea herodias), and osprey (Pandion haliaetus). For the receptor predicted to receive the highest PFAS exposure (spotted sandpiper), model-predicted exposure to PFOS exceeded a laboratory-based, No Observed Adverse Effect Level exposure benchmark in three of the five model scenarios, confirming that risks to aquatic-dependent avian wildlife should be considered for investigations of historic AFFF releases. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFHxS, PFOS, and PFDS) represented 94% (on average) of total PFAS exposures due to their prevalence in historical AFFF formulations, and increased bioaccumulation in aquatic prey items and partitioning to aquatic sediment relative to perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids. Sediment-associated PFASs (rather than water-associated PFASs) were the source of the highest predicted PFAS exposures, and are likely to be very important for understanding and managing AFFF site-specific ecological risks.

The PFAS mixture was chosen based on measured PFAS concentrations in earthworms at a Norwegian skiing area (Trondheim) and consisted of eight different PFAS. Dietary exposure to PFAS led to lower total brain dopamine (DA) concentrations in male mice, as compared to control. On the transcript level, brain tyrosine hydroxylase (th) of PFAS exposed males was reduced, compared to the control group. No significant differences were observed on the transcript levels of enzymes responsible for DA metabolism, namely – monoamine oxidase (maoa and maob) and catechol-O methyltransferase (comt). We detected increased transcript level for DA receptor 2 (dr2) in PFAS exposed females, while expression of DA receptor 1 (dr1), DA transporter (dat) and vesicular monoamine transporter (vmat) were not affected by PFAS exposure. Regarding the steroid hormones, plasma and muscle testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and 17β-estradiol (E2) levels, as well as transcripts for estrogen receptors (esr1 and esr2), gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh) and aromatase (cyp19) were unaltered by the PFAS treatment.

We report a comprehensive study on occurrence of PFASs, including legacy, substitute and emerging ones, from Pakistan. Surface water samples were collected from five ecologically important freshwater reservoirs in Pakistan, namely, Head Panjnad (HP), Head Trimmu (HT), Chashma Barrage (CB), Head Blloki (HB), and Head Qadirabad (HQ). The detection frequencies of PFASs ranged between 37 %–100 %. The highest concentration of ∑15PFASs was detected at HP (114.1 ng L−1), whereas the lowest at HQ (19.9 ng L−1). Among the analyzed PFASs, 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) showed maximum mean concentrations of 9.1 ng L−1 and 7 ng L−1 at HP, followed by Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) with level of 0.99 ng L−1 at HT. The ecological risk assessment for selected species i.e., daphnid, mysid, fish and green algae showed that PFOS, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) exhibited moderate risk i.e., Hazard Quotients (HQs) < 1 to the modeled organisms, whereas perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) showed the high risk to green algae (HQs = 8.6) and PFOA presented a high risk to all the organisms (HQs ranged between 1.04 and 7.38).

Aquatic environments such as seawater are important PFAS sinks due to the strong stability and water solubility of PFAS. In this study, the occurrence, temporal variation, and source appointment of 17 legacy and 16 emerging PFAS in seven different mollusks from nine cities around the Bohai Sea, China, were investigated from 2010 to 2018. Significantly higher concentrations of legacy PFAS compared to those of emerging PFAS indicate that legacy PFAS products, including perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid, are still widely used in China. However, the decreasing trend of the legacy PFAS concentrations in mollusks after 2015 indicate that these products are gradually being withdrawn from the market due to China's implementation of the Stockholm Convention. A positive matrix factorization was used to identify six primary pollution sources including electrochemical fluorination processes, domestic sewage discharge, metal plating, food packaging, the fluorochemical industry, and the fluoropolymer industry.

Of those, PFHxS was the only PFAS found in all terrapin plasma samples. Four additional PFAS were routinely detected (greater than 90% of the samples) and were included in statistical analyses: PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUnA. Sex-differences were observed for two creeks with male plasma containing higher PFAS than female plasma (PFHxS at Townsend Creek, PFOS at Oyster Creek). Sex-specific site differences in PFAS concentrations were observed primarily for males, suggesting male terrapins may be more sensitive indicators of localized contaminant profiles than females. Three PFAS were observed to have negative correlations with body mass: PFOS in males (p = 0.045, tau = -0.220), PFNA in males (p = 0.016, tau = -0.269), and PFHxS in both males (p = 0.007, tau = -0.302) and females (p = 0.001, tau = -0.379).

Swordtip squid (Uroteuthis edulis) is one of the most popular and highly consumed seafood worldwide, with wide distribution and abundant biomass. Therefore, it is of great importance to the health of the public by reducing the health risks of squid consumption while preserving the benefits of squid to humans. In this study, the PFAS and fatty acids in squids were tested from the southeast coastal regions of China, a major habitat for squids. Relative higher concentrations of PFAS in squid were found in the subtropical zone of southern China (mean: 15.90 ng/g·dw) compared to those of the temperate zone of northern China (mean: 11.77 ng/g·dw). The digestive system had high tissue/muscle ratio (TMR) values, and the pattern of TMR among the same carbon-chain PFAS was similar. Cooking methods have a significant contribution to eliminating PFAS (in squids). PFAS were transferred from squids to other mediums after cooking, so juice and oil should be poured out to minimize PFAS exposure into body. The result showed that squids can be regarded as a healthy food by health benefits associated with fatty acids. Estimated daily intake (EDI) had the highest level in Korea via consuming squids through cooking processes compared with other countries. Based on the assessment of the hazard ratios (HRs), there was a high exposure risk of perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) via taking squids for human health.

It is unknown whether the production of acylcarnitines in primary human myotubes obtained from lean, metabolically healthy subjects reflects the fat oxidation in vivo. Objective: Our objective was to quantify the acylcarnitine production in myotubes obtained from subjects with low and high fasting respiratory quotient (RQ). Methods: Fasting RQ was determined by indirect calorimetry. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were taken from 6 subjects with low fasting RQ (mean 0.79 +/- 0.03) and 6 with high fasting RQ (0.90 +/- 0.03), and satellite cells were isolated, cultured, and differentiated to myotubes. Myotubes were cultivated with 125 mu(MC)-C-13-labeled palmitate for 30 minutes and 4 and 24 hours. Quantitative profiling of 42 intracellular and 31 extracellular acylcarnitines was performed by stable isotope dilution-based metabolomics analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Results: Myotubes from donors with high fasting RQ produced and released significant higher amounts of medium-chain acylcarnitines. High (13)C8 and (13)C10 acylcarnitine levels in the extracellular compartment correlated with high fasting RQ. The decreased expression of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) in these myotubes can explain the higher rate of incomplete fatty acid oxidation. A lower intracellular [C-13] acetylcarnitine to carnitine and lower intracellular (13)C16/(13)C18 acylcarnitine to carnitine ratio indicate reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity in these myotubes. Mitochondrial DNA content was not different. Conclusion: Acylcarnitine production and release from primary human myotubes of donors with high fasting RQ indicate a reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity and a higher rate of incomplete fatty acid oxidation. Thus, quantitative profiling of acylcarnitine production in human myotubes can be a suitable tool to identify muscular determinants of fat oxidation in vivo.",NA,2019041113513160200,"Muscle Fibers;Skeletal;Muscle Fibers, Skeletal",NA,NA

The results showed that a significant improvement in PFOS removal rate was observed in the presence of BSA. The higher the concentration of BSA, the higher PFOS removal rate was. When BSA and inorganic ions coexisted in the feed solution, PFOS removal rate increased with the increase of ionic strength. This may be because BSA would not only absorb some PFOS, but also cause membrane fouling. The higher the BSA concentration, the more serious membrane fouling was. Consequently, the screening ability of fouled membrane and the electrostatic repulsion force between the membrane surface and PFOS were enhanced. Thus, the removal rate of PFOS increased. The existence of ions reduced the electrostatic repulsion force between BSA and the membrane surface, which resulted in thicker BSA fouling layers and enhanced membrane sieving capacity.
