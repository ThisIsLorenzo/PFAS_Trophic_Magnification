This population is expanding its range, presumably because of the use of human waste disposal sites as food resource. We hypothesized that habitat urbanization, presumably associated with feeding from human wastes, could influence the accumulation of persistent organic pollutants and metals. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between accumulated pollutants and biochemical parameters in nestling blood. We used the proportion of urban surface within an 8 km radius of each nest as a proxy to study the relationship between anthropic influence and pollutant accumulation. Observed blood levels of metals, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were relatively low, as expected for nestling individuals due to short-term exposures. CB-180 and PBDEs were associated with variations in blood biochemistry parameters; hexa-BDEs appeared positively associated with activities of the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, whereas CB-180 accumulation was associated with an increased activity of creatine phosphokinase and elevated glutathione levels. Increased CB-180 levels were also related to decreased blood concentrations of calcium, cholesterol, α-tocopherol and lutein. A proportion of urban surfaces as low as 6.56% within a radius of 8 km around the nest appears related to the accumulation of CB-180, the majority of analysed PFAS and of PBDE congeners 99 and 209, and increased urbanization was also associated with decreased plasma levels of α-tocopherol and carotenoids. These associations suggest that changes in blood profiles of vitamins, carotenoids or other analytes, despite related to increased plasma levels of CB-180, would be consequence of exploitation of artificial food sources rather than of a direct effect of the pollutants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd; Accumulation of POPs in nestlings of the endangered Egyptian vulture associates with territory urbanization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.06.101,PFAS;Humans;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Spain;Metals;animal;Blood;ecosystem;Ecosystem;environmental exposure;nonhuman;unclassified drug;blood analysis;nestling;Organic pollutants;polybrominated diphenyl ether;polychlorinated biphenyl;raptor;bioaccumulation;biological marker;biomarker;environmental monitoring;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;Chlorine compounds;Biomarkers;Catalonia;urban area;urbanization;procedures;Polychlorinated biphenyls;blood level;human;Urbanization;growth;blood;Falconiformes;calcium;glutathione;organochlorine pesticide;PBDE;Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs);Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs);animal food;biochemical analysis;physiology;physiological response;Aves;enzyme activity;organochlorine;scavenger;vulture (bird);Organochlorine compounds;air pollutant;waste disposal facility;alpha tocopherol;aspartate aminotransferase;Aspartate aminotransferase;blood biochemistry;calcium blood level;creatine kinase;endangered species;Endangered Species;lactate dehydrogenase;Neophron percnopterus;organic pollution;PBDEs;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);Pigments;polyfluoroalkylated substance;territory;vitamin blood level;Vulture;Waste disposal;xanthophyll;aging;development;environmental;domestic chemicals;industrial;Biological Markers,NA,NA

However, field studies on SSA's role as vector of transport of PFAS are lacking. Following a multiphase approach, seawater (SW), the sea-surface microlayer (SML) and SSA were sampled simultaneously at South Bay (Livingston Island, Antarctica). Average PFAS concentrations were 313 pg L−1, 447 pg L−1, and 0.67 pg m−3 in SW, the SML and SSA, respectively. The enrichment factors of PFAS in the SML and SSA ranged between 1.2 and 5, and between 522 and 4690, respectively. This amplification of concentrations in the SML is consistent with the surfactant properties of PFAS, while the large enrichment of PFAS in atmospheric SSA may be facilitated by the large surface area of SSA and the sorption of PFAS to aerosol organic matter. This is the first field work assessing the simultaneous occurrence of PFAS in SW, the SML and SSA. The large measured amplification of concentrations in marine aerosols supports the role of SSA as a relevant vector for long-range atmospheric transport of PFAS. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115512,Fluorocarbons;Surface waters;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Canada;fluorocarbon;Organic pollutants;persistent organic pollutant;pollutant;concentration (composition);Antarctic Regions;Antarctica;long range transport;Southern ocean;sea water;article;Atmospheric movements;island (geological);Islands;Ontario [Canada];Seawater;sea;atmospheric deposition;Atmospheric transport;Manitoulin Island;South Bay;Long-range atmospheric transports;Aerosols;aerosol;Southern Ocean;enrichment;Surfactant properties;Enrichment factors;spray;Oceans;Seas;aerosol formation;Maritime Antarctica;microlayer;Multiphase approach;sea surface;Sea surface microlayer;Sea-spray aerosol;Sea-surface microlayer,NA,NA

Different variables affecting the chromatographic separation (column type and pH of the mobile phase), the electrospray ionization (capillary voltage, nebulizer pressure and drying gas flow) and mass spectrometric detection (fragmentor voltage and collision energy) were optimized in order to improve the sensitivity of the separation and detection steps. In the case of FUSLE variables such as the solvent type, the solvent volume, the extraction temperature, the sonication and extraction time and the percentage of applied irradiation power were studied. Under optimized conditions, sonication of 2.5. min with pulse times on of 0.8. s and pulse times off of 0.2. s in 7. mL of (9:1) acetonitrile (ACN): water mixture in duplicate guaranteed exhaustive extraction of the matrices analyzed. Due to the non-selective extraction using FUSLE, different SPE cartridges (200-mg Waters Oasis-HLB, 150-mg Waters Oasis-WAX and 150-mg Waters Oasis-MAX) were tested in terms of extraction efficiency and matrix effect both in the extraction and detection steps. Mix mode SPE using Waters Oasis-WAX provided the best extraction efficiencies with the lowest matrix effect. The final method was validated in terms of recovery at two fortification levels (in the 80-120% for most of the analytes and matrices), precision (relative standard deviation in the 2-15% range) and method detection limits (MDLs, 0.3-12.4. ng/g for vegetables, 0.2-12.5. ng/g for fish and 1-22. ng/g for amended soil).

However, there is a lack of temporally variable and catchment-scale mass loading data, meaning identification and prioritization of sources of PFAS to rivers for management interventions can be difficult. Here, we analyze PFAS concentrations and loads in the River Mersey to provide the first temporally robust estimates of PFAS export for a European river system and the first estimates of the contribution of wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) to total river PFAS export. We estimate an annual PFAS export of 68.1 kg for the River Mersey and report that the yield of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the catchment is among the highest recorded globally. Analysis of river and WwTW loads indicates approximately one-third of PFOA emitted from WwTWs is potentially stored in the catchment and approximately half of PFOS transported by the River Mersey may not originate from WwTWs. As governments move toward regulation of PFAS in WwTW effluents, our findings highlight the complexity of PFAS source apportionment and the need for catchment-scale mass loading data. This study indicates that strategies for reducing PFAS loading that focus solely on WwTW effluents may not achieve river water quality targets. © 2024 The Authors.

To date, remediation of PFAS-contaminated wastewaters have been mainly undertaken with poorly cost-effective strategies, involving multi-step processes. Advanced separation systems enabling the selective capture and concentration of PFAS must be developed. In this work, the potential of nanofiltration (NF) membranes to reject short chain length PFAS, potassium nonafluoro-1-butanesulfonate (C4F9SO3K), is demonstrated with both bare polymeric and amine functionalized-boron nitride BN(NH2) nanosheet-decorated membranes. The BN(NH2)-decorated membranes exhibited almost 1.04 times higher permeation upon C4F9SO3K filtration compared to the bare poly(piperazine amide) (PPA) membranes (53 versus 26 L m(-2) h(-1)), while maintaining very high C4F9SO3K rejection levels above 93%. A commercial membrane exhibited similar permeation to BN(NH2)-decorated membrane, but only retained similar to 65% of the C4F9SO3K. The improved filtration performance of the BN(NH2)-decorated membrane was rationalized based on advanced characterization results to its enhanced wettability and negative charge density, resulting in weak interactions between the C4F9SO3K and BN(NH2) nanosheets.

Total concentrations of PBDEs and NBFRs in indoor dust samples ranged from 43 to 480 ng g-1 (median 170 ng g-1) and from 56 to 2200 ng g-1 (median 180 ng g-1), respectively. The most abundant PBDE congener in these dust samples was BDE-209 with concentrations ranging from 29 to 360 ng g-1, accounting for 62.6-86.5% of total PBDE levels. Among the NBFRs analyzed, decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) was the predominant compound with a mean contribution of 98.6% total NBFR amounts. Significant concentrations of DBDPE were detected in all dust samples (median 180 ng g-1, range 54-2200 ng g-1), due to DBDPE as a substitute for deca-BDE. Other NBFRs such as 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153) were found at very low levels. Based on the measured BFR concentrations, daily intake doses (IDs) of PBDEs and NBFRs via dust ingestion at exposure scenarios using the median and 95th percentile levels for both adults and children were calculated for risk assessment. The results showed that the daily exposure doses via dust ingestion of all compounds, even in the high-exposure scenarios were also lower than their reference dose (RfD) values.

The effects on survival and growth parameters and liver histopathology were assessed. Although growth suppression (weight and length) was observed in fish treated with high concentrations PFOS during the exposure period, no mortality was observed throughout the 70 d experiment. Embryos and larvae (F1) derived from maternal exposure suffered malformation and mortality. Exposure to 50 and 250 μg L-1 PFOS could inhibit the growth of the gonads (GSI) in the female zebrafish. Histopathological alterations, primary with lipid droplets accumulation, were most prominently seen in the liver of males and the changes were not reversible, even after the fish were allowed to recover for 30 d in clean water. The triiodothyronine (T3) levels were not significantly changed in any of the exposure groups. Hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) gene expression was significantly up-regulated in both male and female zebrafish, but the sex ratio was not altered.

PFOA and PFOS have been reported to alter inflammatory responses, production of cytokines, and adaptive and innate immune responses in rodent models, avian models, reptilian models, and mammalian and nonmammalian wildlife.

AFFF has historically contained high levels of long-chain per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which pose serious health concerns. However, the composition and toxicity of legacy AFFF mixtures are unknown, presenting great uncertainties in risk assessment and affected communities. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the fluorinated and nonfluorinated chemical composition of a legacy AFFF sample and its toxicity in zebrafish embryos. METHODS: A sample of legacy AFFF (3% application formulation, manufactured before 2001) was provided by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to identify PFAS and nonfluorinated compounds, and a commercial laboratory measured 24 PFAS by a modified U.S. EPA Method 537.1. AFFF toxicity was assessed in zebrafish embryos in comparison with four major constituents: perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS); perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS); sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); and sodium tetradecyl sulfate (TDS). End points included LC50 values, and sublethal effects on growth, yolk utilization, and pancreas and liver development. RESULTS: We identified more than 100 PFAS. Of the PFAS detected, PFOS was measured at the highest concentration (9,410 mg/L) followed by PFHxS (1,500 mg/L). Fourteen nonfluorinated compounds were identified with dodecyl sulfate and tetradecyl sulfate the most abundant at 547.8 and 496:4 mg/L, respectively. An LC50 of 7:41 × 10−4% AFFF was calculated, representing a dilution of the 3% formulation. TDS was the most toxic of the constituents tested but could not predict the AFFF phenotype in larval zebrafish. PFOS exposure recapitulated the reduction in length but could not predict effects on development of the liver, which was the tissue most sensitive to AFFF. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this research is the first characterization of the chemical composition and toxicity of legacy AFFF, which has important implications for regulatory toxicology. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6470. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and a wide range of per-and poly-fluorinated chemicals (PFASs) were analysed in all samples. The sum of PFAS concentrations (Sigma PFAS) increased from aquatic plants to fish dorsal muscles; molecular profiles were dominated by C9-C13 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), while perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) were detected in all samples at lower concentrations. SPFAS and especially Sigma PFCAs were higher in barbels (B. barbus) than in other species, while roaches (R. rutilus) were less contaminated by PFOS than barbels and gudgeons (G. gobio). Gudgeons accumulated significantly higher FOSA concentrations. Young (small) barbels displayed significantly higher PFOS, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) concentrations than did large specimens; conversely, perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeDA) concentrations were significantly higher in large barbels. Multiple linear regressions were performed on the whole set of fish samples with size, mass and isotopic ratios as explicative variables, and several single compounds as explained variables. Regardless of the compound, the regressions did not explain much of the contamination variability. However, adding species as a qualitative variable, i.e. performing analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) improved the fit greatly, while adding sex did not. Diet (i.e. delta C-13 and delta N-15) was the main factor explaining interspecific differences. Biotransformation was assessed by comparing concentration ratios of PFOS or FOSA to their precursors in the food-web compartments. These ratios increased from invertebrates to fish, and differed among fish species, suggesting that biotransformation occurred but was species-specific. Biomagnification factor calculations showed that C11-C13 PFCAs, PFOS and FOSA were apparently biomagnified in barbels and gudgeons. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the determination of endogenous BRs in plant tissue is still a challenging task due to their low abundance and the complex matrix of plant tissues. In this study, a single step strategy by combining tip extraction and in situ derivatization was proposed for BR analysis. In the proposed strategy, a mixed mode sorbent (C8-SO3H) in tip was modified with 4-phenylaminomethyl-benzeneboric acid (4-PAMBA) through cation exchange and hydrophobic interactions, and then used as a boronate affinity media to selectively capture and purify BRs from plant extract through the reaction of boric acid groups of 4-PAMBA and cis-diol on BRs. The BRs-4-PAMBA derivatives formed were easily eluted from the C8-SO3H tip by nullifying the ion exchange and hydrophobic interactions using ammonia acetonitrile, followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. BR standards, isotopically labeled with d(5)-4-phenylaminomethyl-benzeneboric acid (4-PAMBA-d(5)) were introduced to improve the assay precision of LC-MS/MS. Under the optimized conditions, the overall process could be completed within 1 h, which is greatly improved in speed compared with previously reported protocols. In addition, the detection sensitivities of labeled BRs were improved by over 2000-fold compared with unlabeled BRs, thus the consumption of plant materials was reduced to 50 mg.

To assess whether PFAS exposure is being underestimated in marine mammals from the Northern Hemisphere, we performed a fluorine mass balance on liver tissues from 11 different species using a combination of targeted PFAS analysis, EOF and total fluorine determination, and suspect screening. Samples were obtained from the east coast United States (US), west and east coast of Greenland, Iceland, and Sweden from 2000 to 2017. Of the 36 target PFASs, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) dominated in all but one Icelandic and three US samples, where the 7:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (7:3 FTCA) was prevalent. This is the first report of 7:3 FTCA in polar bears (â&circ;¼1000 ng/g, ww) and cetaceans (<6-190 ng/g, ww). In 18 out of 25 samples, EOF was not significantly greater than fluorine concentrations derived from sum target PFASs. For the remaining 7 samples (mostly from the US east coast), 30-75% of the EOF was unidentified. Suspect screening revealed an additional 37 PFASs (not included in the targeted analysis) bringing the total to 63 detected PFASs from 12 different classes. Overall, these results highlight the importance of a multiplatform approach for accurately characterizing PFAS exposure in marine mammals.

It has been increasingly detected in environmental matrices in recent years, causing great concern regarding its potential health risks to humans and wildlife. However, its adverse effects on biota remain largely unknown. To explore the chronic toxicity of F-53B on reproduction, a two-generational study was conducted using zebrafish (Danio rerio). Adult zebrafish (F0 generation) were chronically exposed to different concentrations of F-53B (0, 5, 50, and 500 μg/L) for 180 d using a flow-through exposure system, with F1 and F2 generations reared without exposure. The reproductive toxicity endpoints were assessed in F0 and F1 adult fish. Results showed that F-53B accumulated in the F0 gonads and transferred to the F1 generation via maternal eggs, and even remained in F1 adult fish and their eggs (F2) after 180 d depuration. In the F0 generation, F-53B exposure significantly inhibited growth and induced reproductive toxicity, including decreased gonadosomatic index and egg production/female, changes in the histological structure of the gonads, and increased serum testosterone levels. In particular, serum estradiol and vitellogenin levels were significantly increased in 5 μg/L F-53B-exposed adult males. The transcriptional levels of several genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis were altered in F0 generation fish. Testis transcriptome analysis revealed that F-53B exposure disrupted spermatogenesis in F0 male zebrafish. Maternal transfer of F-53B also induced adverse effects on growth and reproduction in the F1 generation. Furthermore, the higher occurrence of malformation and lower survival in F1 and F2 embryos indicated that parental exposure to F-53B could impair the embryonic development of offspring. Taken together, this study demonstrated that F-53B could induce reproductive toxicity in zebrafish similar to that induced by legacy PFOS, and its potential adverse effects on offspring deserve further investigation. Long-term exposure to F-53B for one generation had adverse effects on reproduction in both F0 and F1 adult fish and impaired embryonic development of offspring. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.120,Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Ovum;Ether;Ethers;Estradiol;Testosterone;Gene Expression Profiling;Spermatogenesis;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;Health risks;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;chlorination;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;gene;chronic toxicity;sulfonate;toxicity;Toxicity;drug effect;embryo development;embryology;Embryonic Development;human;serum;egg production;growth;Reproductive toxicities;reproductive toxicity;blood;placental transfer;F-53B;metabolism;protein blood level;animal model;down regulation;limit of quantitation;zebra fish;fluorination;genetic transcription;Zebrafish;ovum;survival rate;gene expression profiling;ether;cyprinid;Danio rerio;concentration (parameters);transcriptome;embryonic development;histology;Body fluids;vitellogenin;Vitellogenins;aging;estradiol;estradiol blood level;Alkanesulfonates;testosterone;testosterone blood level;Water Pollutants;Testis;spermatogenesis;development;testis;Chemical;4;2;5;1;inhibition;3;female fertility;aromatase;spawning;growth inhibition;RNA sequence;Transcriptome analysis;6;Reproductive toxicity;star gene;2-((6-chloro-1;2-tetrafluoroethanesulfonic acid;6-dodecafluorohexyl)oxy)-1;hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system;17 beta hsd gene;3 beta hsd gene;Chronic exposure;cyp17 gene;cyp19a gene;cytochrome P450 family 17;era gene;ether sulfonic acid;Flow-through exposure systems;follitropin beta subunit;follitropin receptor;fsh beta gene;fshr gene;Histological structure;hmgra gene;Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis;lh beta gene;lhr gene;luteinizing hormone beta subunit;rearing;RNA analysis;Sulfones,NA,NA

In this study, the uptake, translocation and phytotoxicity of PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA in mung bean (Vigna radiata (Linn.) Wilczek.) were investigated. The uptake kinetics of PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA fit the Michaelis-Menten equation well, suggesting that the uptake is a carrier-mediated process. The root concentration factor (RCF) of 6:2 Cl-PFESA (34.55 mL g−1 dw) was 1.27 times that of PFOS (27.11 mL g−1 dw), and the translocation factor (TF) of 6:2 Cl-PFESA (0.177) was 1.07 times that of PFOS (0.165). Exposure to 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS both resulted in the inhibition of mung bean seedling development. Treatment with 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS led to the concentration-dependent elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl groups, and phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) levels in mung bean roots. The MDA and carbonyl group contents induced by 6:2 Cl-PFESA were 1.10–1.35 and 1.03–1.14 times, respectively, those of PFOS. The hydroxyl free radical (·OH) levels in mung bean roots after exposure to PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA were elevated significantly, and the ·OH levels induced by 6:2 Cl-PFESA were higher than those induced by PFOS. Hydroxyl free radical levels were positively correlated with the MDA and carbonyl group contents in mung bean roots (p < 0.05). The dynamic changes in some antioxidative enzyme activities in mung bean seedlings were determined, including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). The results demonstrated the phytotoxicities of 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS to mung bean in the early developmental stage. 6:2 Cl-PFESA is more harmful to mung beans than PFOS. The production of hydroxyl radical is the mechanism that causes the toxicity of PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA toward plants. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117332,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Antioxidants;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Ether;Ethers;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;comparative study;controlled study;bioaccumulation;Chlorine compounds;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;phytotoxicity;sulfonate;sulfonic acid derivative;toxicity;Toxicity;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;catalase;ether derivative;enzyme activity;ether;superoxide dismutase;malonaldehyde;developmental stage;Enzymes;Free radicals;Accumulation;kinetics;Malondialdehyde;Plants (botany);protein phosphorylation;carrier protein;inhibition;plant root;Sulphonates;electroplating;chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate;peroxidase;legume;histone H2AX;hydroxyl radical;carbonyl derivative;root;Carbonyl groups;Chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate;Chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulphonate;Hydroxyl free radicals;Michaelis Menten kinetics;mung bean;Mung bean;Mungbeans;OH+-;seed development;Vigna;Vigna radiata;Vigna radiata var. radiata;Sulfones,NA,NA

In the present study, PPs have been considered one of the emerging pollutants (EPs) and a cause of concern in river health assessment. Beyond the reported increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ABRB), PPs have been found adversely affecting the biotic diversity in such water environments. Considering Algae, Macroinvertebrates, and Fishes as three distinct trophic level indicators, the present study puts forward a framework for showing River Health Condition (RHC) based on the calculation of a River Health Index (RHI). The RHI is calculated using six Indicator Group Scores (IGS) which individually reflect river health in a defined category of water quality characteristics. While Dissolved Oxygen Related Parameters (DORP), Nutrients (NT), and PPs are taken as causative agents affecting RHCs, scores of Algal-Bacterial (AB) symbiosis, Macroinvertebrates (MI), and Fishes (F) are considered as an effect of such environmental conditions. Current wastewater treatment technologies are also not very effective in the removal of PPs. The objective of the present study is to review the harmful effects of PPs on the aquatic environment, particularly on the chemical and biotic indicators of river health. Based on predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes in the aquatic environment and measured environmental concentration (MEC) in the river, the estimated risk quotient (RQ) for norfloxacin in the Isakavagu-Nakkavagu stream of river Godavari, Hyderabad is found 293 for algae, 39 for MI, and 335 for fish. Among PPs, in Indian rivers, the presence of caffeine is the most frequent, with algae at the highest level of risk (RQ max = 24.5). Broadly six PPs, including azithromycin, caffeine, diclofenac, naproxen, norfloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole are found above PNEC values in Indian rivers. The application of IGS and RHI in understanding and presenting the river health condition (RHC) through colored hexagons has been demonstrated for the river Ganga near Varanasi (India) as an example. Identification of critical indicator groups, based on IGS provides a scientific basis for planned intervention for river health restoration to achieve an acceptable category.

Total PFAS concentrations (ng/L) range from 0.22-73.9 (mean=22.1) for the major rivers, 0.54-3.19 (mean=1.77) for the rice field areas, and <LOQ-27.8 (mean=3.90) for the industrialized bays.

Positive significant Pearson correlations were determined for PFNA and PFDA (p<0.01, r=0.91) and PFOA and PFNA (p<0.01, r= 0.72). The results of this study indicate a general ascending order of PFCAs, PFSAs and PFASs concentrations in six sampling site groups categorized by potential PFASs emission sources as non-source <agricultural source<“outer bay source”<“inner bay source”<municipal source<wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge.

They are classified as persistent and bioaccumulative substances. Because of the emerging relevance of PFCs in food safety, there is an extreme need for efficient sample preparation procedures and high sensitive detection. Their analysis is a challenge due to the complexity of food matrices and low concentration levels usually found in food samples. The aim of the study was the development of a PFOA and PFOS determination method based on the dispersive Solid Phase Extraction (d-SPE) with micro-UHPLC-MS/MS system in honey samples. Different types of sorbents: silica based (PSA, SAX, NH2, FL and C-18) and polymer based (ENV) and acetonitrile as an extraction solvent were applied. The recovery ratios for all tested sorbents were ranged from 40% to 84% for PFOA and from 47% to 87% for PFOS. The obtained results showed that the best recovery ratios 84% for PFOA and 87% for PFOS were received for the method with polymer based sorbent - ENV with RSD lower than 5% for both compounds. The results indicated that the d-SPE with ENV sorbent can be successfully applied for the determination of PFOA and PFOS in honey samples. Application of the developed method for honey samples from European countries showed presence of PFOA within the range of 0.103-0223 ng g(-1) whereas PFOS was below LOQ and not detected.

Five distinct peaks attributed to different isomers of PFECHS and perfluoropropylcyclopentanesulfonate (PFPCPeS) were identified in environmental samples. The sum of PFECHS and PFPCPeS isomers displayed logarithmically decreasing spatial trends in water (1.04-324 ng/L) and sediment samples (<MLQ 2.23 ng/g dw) with increasing distance from Beijing international airport. PFECHS and PFPCPeS displayed the highest accumulation in liver, kidney, blood and bladder and average whole body bioaccumulation factors (log BAF(whole-body)) were estimated to be 2.7 and 1.9 respectively. Isomer-specific differences in the tissue/blood distribution ratios and BAF(whole-body) indicate that ring structure and position of the sulfonic acid group affect the bioaccumulation potential of cyclic perfluoroalkyl acids.

Here, matched influent, effluent, and sludge samples were collected from 58 municipal WWTPs in China, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Kenya. Target and suspect screening of PFASs was performed to explore their profiles in WWTPs and assess removal efficiency and environmental emissions. In total, 155 and 58 PFASs were identified in WWTPs in China and Africa, respectively; 146 and 126 PFASs were identified in wastewater and sludge, respectively. Novel compounds belonging to per- and polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs) and sulfonic acids (PFESAs), hydrogen-substituted polyfluorocarboxylic acids (H-PFCAs), and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (PFSMs) accounted for a considerable proportion of total PFASs (ΣPFASs) in Chinese WWTPs and were also widely detected in African samples. In China, estimated national emissions of ΣPFASs in WWTPs exceeded 16.8 t in 2015, with >60 % originating from emerging PFASs. Notably, current treatment processes are not effective at removing PFASs, with 35 of the 54 WWTPs showing emissions higher than mass loads. PFAS removal was also structure dependent. Based on machine learning models, we found that molecular descriptors (e.g., LogP and molecular weight) may affect adsorption behavior by increasing hydrophobicity, while other factors (e.g., polar surface area and molar refractivity) may play critical roles in PFAS removal and provide novel insights into PFAS pollution control. In conclusion, this study comprehensively screened PFASs in municipal WWTPs and determined the drivers affecting PFAS behavior in WWTPs based on machine learning models. © 2022",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159638,Fluorocarbons;wastewater;WWTP;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Sulfur compounds;China;Amides;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;environmental monitoring;chemistry;hydrophobicity;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;geographic distribution;spatial distribution;Spatial distribution;sulfonic acid derivative;ecosystem restoration;carboxylic acid derivative;polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid;molecular weight;sulfonamide;Sewage;sludge;Waste Water;Wastewater treatment;wastewater treatment plant;waste water treatment plant;surface area;Efficiency;Effluents;Removal efficiencies;waste component removal;structure analysis;sewage;Water Pollutants;Chemical;machine learning;pollution control;Water Purification;carbon emission;perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide;Emerging PFASs;Emerging polyfluoroalkyl substance;Machine learning;Sewage pumping plants;Waste water treatment plants;water management;Water treatment plants;pollutant removal;Pollution control;municipal wastewater;Municipal wastewater treatment plants;chemisorption;Removal;Environmental emission;Environmental emissions;field emission;hydrogen substituted polyfluorocarboxylic acid;Kenya;Machine learning models;On-machines;polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acid;removal experiment;Sludge samples;South Sudan;Sudan;Tanzania,NA,NA

Such unknown substances, possibly with high molecular weight, might be precursors of hazardous or controlled known PFAS. Recent studies confirmed that total organic fluorine (TOF) content often can not be explained by the measured target PFAS. One of the suspected classes of such unknowns are polymers with fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residues in a side chain. In this report we suggest hydrolysis of precursors, as a complementary method to account for the unknown PFAS. It was shown here that hydrolysis allows to preserve structural information on the perlfuorinated parts of the precursors, which can be an advantage for the purpose of accurate risk assessment or source identification. A convenient procedure for hydrolysis with 4% sodium hydroxide in water-methanol mixture (1:9) at 60 °C for 16 h was shown to convert model substances - FTOH acrylate, methacrylate and isobutyrate esters as well as FTOH phenylcarbamate to free FTOHs.

Quantification in AH and CB was achieved by stable isotope dilution employing tetra-deuterated analog of latanoprost free acid, used as internal standard. Sample preparation was based on protein precipitation with methanol in AH, and on liquid extraction with a mixture of ethyl acetate and isopropanol 60:40 (v/v) in CB. Elution was achieved on an octylsilica (C8) column, using an isocratic elution method. Detection was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, using ESI in positive ion selected reaction monitoring mode. Calibration curves were linear in the validated concentration ranges of 10160ng/mL in AH and 801280ng/g in CB. The accuracy and precision values, obtained from three different sets of quality control samples, each analyzed in triplicate on three different days, were within the generally accepted criteria for analytical methods (< 15%). The limit of detection was 30.66pg/mL in AH and 237.75pg/g in CB.

Environmental concern consists in BPA entrance into aquatic ecosystems due to acute and chronic toxicity to invertebrates and vertebrates. This study aimed to determine acute BPA toxicity to tropical estuarine-marine species of four trophic levels and integrate BPA toxicity values using species sensitivity distribution (SSD) analysis. Our hypothesis is that BPA toxicity increases towards higher trophic levels. Microalga (Tetraselmis sp.), zooplanktonic grazer (Artemia salina), deposit-feeder invertebrate (Heleobia australis), and omnivorous fish (Poecilia vivipara) were chosen as experimental models. Tetraselmis sp. showed the highest BPA tolerance, without a concentration-dependent response. Species sensitivity have increased from A. salina (LC50,96h = 107.2 mg L-1), followed by H. australis (LC50,96h = 11.53.5 mg L-1), to P. vivipara (LC50,96h = 3.5 mg L-1). Despite the toxicity hierarchy towards trophic levels, which partially supported our hypothesis, SSD did not evidence a clear pattern among estuarine-marine trophic groups. Our study disclosed the sensitivity of not yet investigated species to BPA and, in an integrative way, highlighted BPA toxic effects at different trophic levels. Although estimated acute hazardous concentration (HC5 = 1.18 mg L-1) for estuarine and marine species was higher than environmentally relevant concentrations, sublethal adverse effects induced by BPA exposure may lead to unbalances in population levels and consequently affect the ecological functioning of tropical coastal systems.

This polymer scavenged FTs and PFCs aggressively necessitating development of a multistep extraction using two solvents. Aged microcosms accumulated more FTs and PFCs than were present in the fresh polymer indicating polymer degradation with a half-life of about 870-1400 years for our coarse-grained test polymer. Modeling indicates that more-finely grained polymers in soils might have half-lives of about 10-17 years assuming degradation is surface-mediated. In our polymer-soil microcosms, PFOA evidently was lost with a half-life as short as 130 days, possibly by polymer-catalyzed degradation.

To address human dietary exposure to DP, estimated dietary intake via vegetable consumption was calculated. The uptake potential indexes of DP from soil into root for tomato and cucumber cultivated under different conditions ranged from 0.089 to 0.71. The ranges of uptake potential indexes of DP from resuspended soil particles into stem, leaf and fruit were 0.68-0.78, 0.27-0.42 and 0.39-0.75, respectively. The uptake potential indexes in greenhouse vegetables were generally higher than those in conventional vegetables when the vegetables had been planted in contaminated soil, indicating that greenhouse enhanced the uptake of DP with a high soil concentration by vegetables. The translocation factor (TF) values of DP in vegetables were in the range of 0.022-0.17, indicating that DP can be transported from root to fruit even though it has a high octanol water partition coefficient (Kow). The half-lives of DP dissipation in soil ranged from 70 to 102 days. The dissipation of DP in greenhouse soil was slightly slower than that in conventional soil. Higher estimated dietary intake (EDI) values of DP via greenhouse vegetables were observed due to the higher concentration of DP in greenhouse vegetables than conventional vegetables.

In this study, the concentrations and distribution of extractable organohalogens (EOX = EOCI + EOBr + EOI) were measured in sediment, blue crab, fishes, birds, and terrapin collected at an estuarine marsh and a nearby creek contaminated by the disposal of wastes from a former chloralkali facility. The concentrations of the organohalogens were in the order of EOCI >> EOBr > EOI. The sediment EOCI concentration was comparable to those reported for sediments at sites that have been contaminated by the disposal of bleached kraft pulp mill effluents. The concentrations of EOCI measured in the tissues of blue crab, fishes, and birds were higher than any values previously reported. The absolute concentrations of EOCI coupled with its elevated proportions relative to the concentrations of EOBr or EOI in biota suggest that wastes from the chloralkali processes are a potential source of chlorinated organics present in the environment. The relative proportion of known [such as, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDDs/PCDFs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), and organochlorine pesticides] to unknown organochlorines in sediment, blue crab, fishes, birds, and terrapin was, on average, 48, 35, 5-25, 1-14, and 4.2%, respectively, which suggested that a major portion of the EOCI measured in biota remained uncharacterized. By assuming that the identities of unknown organochlorines in sediment and biota were similar, the estimated biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) for the unknown EOCI fraction suggested that the components of this fraction have a tendency to bioaccumulate in the food chain.",NA,10.1021/es9811142,character(0),NA,NA

In this study, concentrations of 10 PFCs were measured in human blood, water (tap water and surface water), freshwater fish, and seafood samples collected from China. On the basis of the data, we calculated daily intakes of PFCs, regional differences in human exposures, and potential risks associated with ingestion of PFCs from diet, drinking water, and indoor dust for the Chinese population. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most predominant PFC found with a mean concentration of 12.5 ng/mL in human blood from Tianjin and 0.92 ng/g wet wt in freshwater fish and seafood; perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the major PFC found in drinking water at a concentration range of 0.10 to 0.92 ng/L. The estimated daily intake of PFOS and PFOA via fish and seafood consumption (EDI fish&seafood) ranged from 0.10 to 2.51 and 0.13 to 0.38 ng/kg bw/day, respectively, for different age groups (i.e., toddlers, adolescents and children, and adults) from selected locations (i.e., Tianjin, Nanchang, Wuhan, and Shenyang). The EDI fish&seafood of PFCs decreased (p < 0.05) with age. The estimated daily intake of PFOS and PFOA via drinking water consumption (EDI drinking water) ranged from 0.006 to 0.014 and 0.010 to 0.159 ng/kg bw/day, respectively. Comparison of EDI fish&seafood and EDI drinking water values with those of the modeled total dietary intake (TDI) of PFCs by adults from Tianjin, Nanchang, Wuhan, and Shenyang showed that contributions of fish and seafood to TDI of PFOS varied depending on the location. Fish and seafood accounted for 7%, 24%, 80%, and 84% of PFOS intake in Nanchang, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Tianjin, respectively, suggesting regional differences in human exposure to PFOS.

In this study, a feeding experiment with laying hens and feed grown on a contamination site was conducted, and PFAS were analyzed in the feed and eggs to assess the transfer of PFAS into eggs. A targeted analysis of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and different sulfonamides was performed. Additionally, the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay was modified by fully oxidizing small amounts of the samples instead of oxidizing their extracts in order to overcome potential losses during extraction. Targeted analysis showed the presence of known PFAAs and four sulfonamides in the feed and egg yolk samples. In the plant-based feed, short-chain PFAAs, methyl and ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (Me- and EtFOSAA), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were the most abundant PFAS. In the eggs, PFOS, FOSAA, and its alkylated homologues showed the highest concentrations. The TOP assay revealed the presence of substantial amounts of precursors with different chain lengths from C4 to C8. The highest relative increase of PFOA after oxidation was observed in egg yolk from the end of the exposure period (828%). The results of this study demonstrate the transfer of PFAAs and their precursors into hens' eggs and emphasize the contribution of (known and unidentified) precursors to the overall PFAS burden in edible products. The modified TOP assay approach was shown to be a powerful tool to better assess the total burden of samples with PFAS. ©",NA,10.1021/acs.jafc.0c04456,PFAS;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Eggs;Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Sulfur compounds;Chickens;Food Contamination;Biotransformation;Amides;animal;female;fluorocarbon;food contamination;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;chicken;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Extraction;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;egg;alkanesulfonic acid;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;metabolism;animal food;Animal Feed;Consumer products;Industrial chemicals;oxidation reduction reaction;Oxidation-Reduction;PFOS precursors;Feeding studies;Laying hens;Chains;Total oxidizable precursor assay;Sulphonamides;Acid precursors;Feeding study;Perfluorooctane sulphonic acid precursor;Ovum,NA,NA

The sorption of PFOS and PFHxS was much stronger than PFOA and PFHxA. The sorption of each PFAA on the minerals followed an order of HM > KL > MM, even though MM was positively while KL and HM were negatively charged, implying that the sorption is driven by some other interactions besides electrostatic attraction. The sorption decreased with an increase in pH and a decrease in ionic strength of the solution, and their impacts on PFOS were much stronger than other three PFAAs.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant PFAS found. PFOS concentrations were higher in LV (medians 2.9-12 ng g-1 fresh weight) than in BS fish (medians 1.0-2.5 ng g-1 fresh weight). Moreover, LV fish was more contaminated with several other PFAS than BS fish. This may be due to anthropogenic discharges from urban areas around LV. The PFAS pattern differed between LV and BS fish, indicating different sources of contamination for the two study areas. Human exposure to PFOS via fish intake was calculated for three study groups, based on consumption data from literature. The groups consisted of individuals that reported moderate or high consumption of BS fish or high consumption of LV fish, respectively. The results showed that PFOS intake strongly depended on individual fish consumption as well as the fish catchment area. Median PFOS intakes were estimated to 0.15 and 0.62 ng kg-1 body weight (bw) d-1 for the consumers of moderate and high amounts of BS fish, respectively. For the group with high consumption of LV fish a median PFOS intake of 2.7 ng kg-1 bw d-1 was calculated. Fish consumption varied considerably within the consumer groups, with maximum PFOS intakes of 4.5 (BS fish) or 9.6 ng kg-1 bw d-1 (LV fish). Comparison of our results with literature data on PFOS intake from food suggests that fish from contaminated areas may be a significant source of dietary PFOS exposure. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicated that annual outputs of the bioaccumulation articles increased steadily in 1991 to 2014. USA dominated the bioaccumulation field, followed by China, Canada, and France. Government agencies, such as Environment Canada and the US Environmental Protection Agency were the leading institutions in bioaccumulation research. The most prolific and promising category was environmental science, which was significantly ahead of other categories, such as toxicology, marine and freshwater biology, as well as environmental engineering.

The presence of PFAS in ground and surface water can create a route for PFAS to enter the soil, exposing ecosystems (including agroecosystems), where they will move through the food web via biomagnification. The toxicity of PFAS to plants, particularly in agricultural ecosystems, is of emerging concern due to the application of biosolids that are often contaminated with PFAS. Nevertheless, due to the low concentrations of PFAS in most agricultural soils, the direct impact of PFAS on plant health is not well understood. We used H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to explore the effects of exposure of two key PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism. We found that Arabidopsis exhibited an accumulation of multiple metabolites, including soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose), multiple amino acids, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, suggesting that PFAS exposure impacts the metabolism of plants by causing an accumulation of stress-related amino acids and soluble sugars that drives increased activity of the TCA cycle. The present study shows that H-1-NMR metabolomics is a viable tool for investigating changes in the metabolic profile of plants exposed to PFAS and can be used to illuminate the stress response of plants in a high-throughput, nonbiased manner.

Moreover, little information has been reported about the association between isomers of PFASs with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) or overweight. To address this shortcoming in the literature, we conducted a study involving 1612 Chinese adults (1204 men and 408 women), ages 22–96 years old, from Shenyang, China, to analyze serum isomers of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and other PFASs. Height, weight and WC were measured by a standardized protocol of WHO. Results indicated that increased serum concentrations of all (both branched and linear) isomers of PFASs were associated with a higher prevalence of overweight, and these associations were more pronounced in women. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) from logistic regression analyses among women were 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06, 1.99) for linear PFOS isomers, 1.33 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.77) for branched PFOS isomers, 1.39 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.81) for 3 + 4 + 5m PFOS, 1.54 (95% CI: 1.08, 2.21) for linear PFOA isomers, and 1.62 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.51) for branched PFOA isomers, respectively. Associations with increased WC were yielded a similar pattern. Linear regression models also showed positive associations between PFASs and BMI or WC. In conclusion, this study suggests that PFASs and their isomers are positively associated with overweight or increased WC, and the associations are stronger in women. Furthermore, PFOA and its isomers displayed the most robust obesogenic associations. © 2019 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.006,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;Obesity;body mass;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;unclassified drug;controlled study;sex difference;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;chemical compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);adult;alkanesulfonic acid;drug effect;blood level;human;Adult;aged;Aged;middle aged;Middle Aged;very elderly;disease association;major clinical study;young adult;Young Adult;sex determination;body weight;polyfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;blood;obesity;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;prevalence;Logistic regression;Linear regression models;Isomers;Anthropometry;Health;isomer;chemically induced;Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);standardization;Sex Factors;body height;clinical protocol;Confidence interval;waist circumference;Body Mass Index;80;over;sex factor;gender;Chinese;Health projects;World Health Organization;Isomers of C8 Health Project;Overweight;PFASs isomers;Waist Circumference,NA,NA

A High-Elevation Catchment Transit Time Modeling Approach,2019,NA,NA,HYDROLOGY,2306-5338,6,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"We determined the streamflow transit time and the subsurface water storage volume in the glacierized high-elevation catchment of the Rofenache (Oetztal Alps, Austria) with the lumped parameter transit time model TRANSEP. Therefore we enhanced the surface energy-balance model ESCIMO to simulate the ice melt, snowmelt and rain input to the catchment and associated delta O-18 values for 100 m elevation bands. We then optimized TRANSEP with streamflow volume and delta O-18 for a four-year period with input data from the modified version of ESCIMO at a daily resolution. The median of the 100 best TRANSEP runs revealed a catchment mean transit time of 9.5 years and a mobile storage of 13,846 mm. The interquartile ranges of the best 100 runs were large for both, the mean transit time (8.2-10.5 years) and the mobile storage (11,975-15,382 mm). The young water fraction estimated with the sinusoidal amplitude ratio of input and output delta O-18 values and delayed input of snow and ice melt was 47%. Our results indicate that streamflow is dominated by the release of water younger than 56 days. However, tracers also revealed a large water volume in the subsurface with a long transit time resulting to a strongly delayed exchange with streamflow and hence also to a certain portion of relatively old water: The median of the best 100 TRANSEP runs for streamflow fraction older than five years is 28%.",NA,10.3390/hydrology6040092,Polytetrafluoroethylene,NA,NA

The total concentration of PFASs in the surface water varied from 140.5 to 1828.5 ng/L, and the highest concentration of PFASs were observed near the entrance of Fuhe river. The topmost contaminant was sodium perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the north and south of the Baiyangdian Lake respectively, which indicated different contamination sources. The total concentration of PFASs in the sediment varied from 0.48 to 30 ng/g, and the distribution of PFASs in the sediment was similar with that in the surface water. The concentrations of polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric diesters (diPAPs) were three to four orders of magnitude lower than those of perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) and PFSAs. Although the pore water and the surface water had similar ΣPFASs, the concentration of perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) in pore water was 1.4 to 4.4 times higher than that in surface water, and the concentration of perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) in pore water was 20–70% that in surface water.

Non-filtered water samples were extracted, purified and pre-concentrated by a solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure. Solid samples (sediments, soils and sludges) were extracted through solvent extraction under acidic conditions and thereafter purified and pre-concentrated using the same SPE procedure as for the water samples. An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in negative electrospray ionisation mode was employed to separate and detect targeted compounds. Twelve labelled internal standards were used to provide an adequate correction compensating for matrix effects. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were between 4 and 10ng/L in water depending on the analytes. For solid samples, the LOQs were 2ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediments and soils, and 20ng/g dw in sludges for all analytes. A surrogate parameter method based on the carboxylation of perfluoroalkyl acid precursors under basic pH conditions was furthermore implemented to estimate the occurrence of non-targeted PFAS compounds. In order to evaluate the reliability of these analytical methods, environmental samples collected around a training area in France, where aqueous fire-fighting foam is used, were analysed. Of all the compounds detected in these environmental samples, 6:2 FTAB was found in the highest concentrations. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA,10.1080/03067319.2016.1196683,Carboxylation;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Mass spectrometry;Phase separation;Solvent extraction;soil;Solid-phase extraction;water;Soils;Electrospray ionization;Perfluorocarboxylic acid;sediment;Tandem mass spectrometry;Carboxylic acids;Sediments;High performance liquid chromatography;Fire extinguishers;Water;Purification;Liquids;High pressure liquid chromatography;Per-;Ultra-high performance liquid chromatographies;fluorotelomer;polyfluorinated compounds;Polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS);ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS);Unsaturated carboxylic acids;Mass Spectrometry,NA,NA

Here, we focus on the case of the Mandt's Black guillemot (Cepphus grylle mandril) breeding at Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (79.00 degrees N, 11.66 degrees E) and investigate exposure to legacy and emerging contaminants in relation to individual physiological status, i.e. body condition, oxidative stress and relative telomere length. Despite its benthic-inshore foraging strategy, the Black guillemot displayed overall similar contaminant concentrations in blood during incubation (Sigma PCB11(15.7 ng/g w.w.) > Sigma PFAS(5) (9.9 ng/g w.w.)> Sigma Pesticides(9) (6.7 ng/g w.w.) > Sigma PBDE4 (2.7 ng/g w.w.), and Hg (0.3 mu g/g d.w.) compared to an Arctic migratory seabird in which several contaminant-related stress responses have been observed. Black guillemots in poorer condition tended to display higher levels of contaminants, higher levels of reactive oxygen metabolites, lower plasmatic antioxidant capacity, and shorter telomere lengths; however the low sample size restrict any strong conclusions. Nevertheless, our data suggests that nonlinear relationships with a threshold may exist between accumulated contaminant concentrations and physiological status of the birds. These findings were used to build a hypothesis to be applied in future modelling for describing how chronic exposure to contaminants may be linked to telomere dynamics.

U trećem tretmanu primijenila se mineralna gnojidba, dok je četvrti tretman obuhvaćao kombinaciju biostimulatora i mineralne gnojidbe. Rezultati su pokazali da je u proljetnim mjesecima populacija nematoda u tlu znatno veća nego ljeti, jer je tada količina vlage u tlu povećana, a život nematoda usko je vezan za film vode oko čestica tla.

The system was implemented on our standard contact angle measuring apparatus employing a Vidicon video camera and a 512 x 256 pixels framegrabber. For calibration of the x and y magnification factors a perfectly spherical ball was used of approximately the same dimensions as the liquid droplet under study. Droplets of water, formamide and hexadecane with volumes varying from 2-200-mu-l were put on FEP-Teflon and PMMA. Erroneous surface tensions were found by ADSA-P when too small or too large droplet volumes were employed. Ideal volumes to be used were dependent on the contact angle and amounted in our system to 5-10-mu-l for theta < 40-degrees, 20-50-mu-l for 40-degrees < theta < 90-degrees and 50-100-mu-l for theta > 90-degrees. Statistical evaluation of results obtained for the same droplet (i.e. water on Parafilm), digitized 16 times using two different sets of five calibration frames, indicated that digitization of the liquid profile is the largest source of variation. Typical standard deviations over 16 images of the same droplet are +/- 0.9 mJ m-2 in surface tension and +/- 1.5-degrees in contact angle. However, in summary it is concluded that ADSA-P is a powerful tool for simultaneous determination of liquid surface tension and contact angle, even when implemented using a relatively simple image analyser.",NA,10.1016/0166-6622(91)80224-C,character(0),NA,NA

A key limitation to field measurement of pollutant distribution is the lack of a highly sensitive and selective monitoring platform, thus severely hindering the decentralized monitoring of pollutant exposure risk. Hence, a sensor was developed in this study by using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). Specifically, Cu2O@C@NiCo2O4, with a large surface area and high conductivity, was coated onto the Au electrode surface and further modified by the anodic electro-polymerization of o-phenylenediamine (o-PD) using perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as the template, followed by template removal for activation, thus obtaining the Au/Cu2O@C@NiCo2O4/MIP electrode. Particularly, an effective monitoring platform derived from this sensor was designed to achieve cost-effective pollution detection. Au/Cu2O@C@NiCo2O4/MIP was employed in a disposable microchip sensor for the sensitive detection of PFOA, exhibiting an ultra-low limit of detection (LOD) of 19.46 ng L−1 in a linear range of 207-4140 ng L−1 along with satisfactory sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility, which reveal its great potential in the low-cost and efficient field detection of PFOA in coastal seawater.

Currently, there are thousands of marketed PFASs, but only dozens of them are routinely monitored. This work involved target, nontarget, and suspect screening of PFASs in the liver of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) and finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides), two resident marine mammals in the South China Sea, stranded between 2012 and 2018. Among the 21 target PFASs, perfluorooctane sulfonate and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) predominated in the samples, accounting for 46 and 30% of the total PFASs, respectively. Significantly higher total target PFAS concentrations (p < 0.05) were found in dolphin liver samples [3.23 × 103 ± 2.63 × 103 ng/g dry weight (dw)] than in porpoise liver samples (2.63 × 103 ± 1.10 × 103 ng/g dw). Significant increasing temporal trends (p < 0.05) were found in the concentrations of two emerging PFASs, perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate and 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-propanoate in porpoises, indicating increasing pollution by these emerging PFASs. Forty-four PFASs from 9 classes were additionally identified by nontarget and suspect screening, among which 15 compounds were reported for the first time in marine mammals.

The results of these studies (on estrogenic activity, development and reproduction, etc.), however, are largely inconsistent owing to differences in exposure conditions (exposure time, concentrations, species and test methods, etc.). Oviparous fish species such as zebrafish and common carp are commonly used in PFOS exposure experiments, but no information is available on ovoviparous fish species. Thus, this study adopted as its model the swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri), a small, hardy and easily raised ovoviparous fish species. Males with a xiphoid caudal fin were employed to investigate vitellogenin (VTG) mRNA expression under exposure to a range of PFOS concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5. mg/l PFOS) for three weeks, with one-week recovery in clean water. Females were used to investigate the reproductive toxicity of PFOS exposure, and were exposed to the same concentrations as the males for up to six weeks. Finally, juveniles (20-30 days old) were exposed to 0 and 0.1. mg/l PFOS for 90 days to check for developmental impairment. VTG mRNA expression was significantly inhibited at one and two weeks, with up-regulation at three weeks, in all of the exposure groups, but was stimulated only in the 2.5. mg/l group at four weeks. The hepatosomatic index (HSI) was elevated in the 2.5. mg/l male group at three weeks and in the juvenile group. The gonadal somatic index (GSI) was elevated in the 0.5. mg/l female group and in the female juveniles. The 14-day survival rates for offspring differed significantly among the groups. Harmful effects were observed on the growth of the juveniles, but not on the sex ratio or the secondary sex characteristics of the young males. Histopathological changes in the liver were detected in both the male and female groups with the highest exposure. The overall results indicate that differences in model species may influence test results. Juveniles possess excellent qualities for sublethal chemical assessments employing the HSI and GSI under long-term exposure conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.05.010,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Animals;Liver;RNA;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;biomonitoring;controlled study;biomarker;survival;animal tissue;water pollutant;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;reproductive behavior;gene expression;sulfonate;toxicity;Hepatotoxicity;liver;article;ecotoxicology;growth;reproductive toxicity;priority journal;pollution effect;metabolism;animal cell;upregulation;physiology;nucleotide sequence;experimental study;juvenile;survival rate;histopathology;Mammalia;gene expression regulation;Gene Expression Regulation;messenger RNA;Cyprinus carpio;Danio rerio;estrogen;estrogen receptor alpha;drug effects;vitellogenin;Vitellogenins;aging;teratogenicity;concentration response;sublethal effect;Water Pollutants;sex ratio;long term exposure;development;Chemical;growth retardation;larva;Survival Analysis;growth response;Development;Growth;estrogen activity;estrogenic compound;Estrogenic effects;Cyprinodontiformes;Ovoviparous;ovoviviparity;Ovoviviparity;swordtail;Xiphophorous helleri;Xiphophorus helleri;Xiphophorus hellerii;Sulfones,NA,NA

The global population depends on one-third of freshwater increasing the demand. The increase in population along with urbanization has polluted the fresh water resources. The pharmaceutical industry is marked as an emerging contaminant of water pollution. The most common type of pharmaceutical drugs that are detected in the environment includes antibiotics, analgesics, NSAIDs, and pain-relieving drugs. These drugs alter the food chain of the organisms causing chaos mainly in the marine ecosystem. Pharmaceutical drugs are found only in shallow amounts (ng/mg) they have a huge impact on the living system. The consumption of water contaminated with pharmaceutical ingredients can disrupt reproduction, hormonal imbalance, cancer, and respiratory problems. Various methods are used to remove these chemicals from the environment. In this review, we mainly focused on the emerging hybrid technologies and their significance in the effective treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. This review paper primarily elaborates on the merits and demerits of existing conventional technologies helpful in developing integrated technologies for the modern era of pharmaceutical effluent treatment. This review paper further in detail discusses the various strategies of eco-friendly bioremediation techniques namely biostimulation, bioaugmentation, bacterial degradation, mycoremediation, phytoremediation, and others for the ultimate removal of pharmaceutical contaminants in wastewater. The review makes clear that targeted and hybrid solutions are what the world will require in the future to get rid of these pharmacological prints.

Black-tailed gull eggs were collected from three breeding islands located in the western (Seoman-do), southern (Hong-do), and eastern (Dok-do) seas of Korea during 2015-2019, and egg contents were analyzed for classical and emerging POPs. Among the target analytes, levels of emerging POPs such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were significantly higher in eggs from Seoman-do than other islands. Global positioning system tracking data show that seagulls from Seoman-do traveled frequently to two neighboring major cities (Incheon and Seoul), indicating that the accumulation of BFRs and PFAAs in bird eggs is directly affected by the pollution characteristics of urban areas. Overall, the ratios of PFAA and BFR to the total POPs in eggs from the islands increased over time, while the proportion of classical POPs decreased. A shift from classical POPs to BFRs and PFAAs in seagull eggs was identified. Interestingly, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which exhibits limited bioaccumulation, was detected at higher levels in eggs from Seoman-do, indicating widespread use of PFOA and maternal transfer to seabird eggs. Continuous monitoring of PFAAs in marine environments of Korea is needed. This study demonstrates that monitoring of seabird eggs is effective for detecting spatial and temporal trends of POPs in the marine environment, and provides insights into emerging POPs such as PFAAs.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157244,African Continental Ancestry Group;Korea;Ovum,NA,NA

The total concentration of PFASs ranged from 2.78 to 115 ng/L, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as the dominant compound. Many emerging PFASs, including 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTS), 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid (Cl-PFESAs), ammonium 4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoate (ADONA), and hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) homologues were frequently detected in 96.7–100% of the samples. Multiple source apportionment analyses indicated that the PFASs in the groundwater mainly originated from industrial activities, but in rural areas, agricultural activities also contributed. The total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay indicated that there were substantial unknown precursors of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in the groundwater samples. The total concentration of PFASs decreased with the well depth, while the PFAA-precursors displayed contrasting vertical profile trends, which might be due to the suppressed microbial transformation in the groundwater.

In Australia high concentrations of PFAS have been found in environments close to sites where Aqueous Film Forming Foams (AFFF) were historically used for firefighting activities. This has resulted in significant community concern about the potential long-term health effects of these chemicals. Objective We describe residents’ perceptions and experiences of PFAS in three regional Australian towns where exposure has occurred. Methods We conducted focus groups to generate free-flowing open discussion on PFAS in three affected communities, including some with significant numbers of First Nations Peoples. We recruited participants using a range of media outlets and postal services. Focus group transcripts were analysed thematically to identify major shared concerns using Atlas Ti. Results One hundred and eighty residents attended fifteen focus groups that were conducted in the three communities. They included 69 First Nations People living in three communities near the town of Katherine in the Northern Territory. Study participants were concerned about potential physical health effects of exposure to PFAS, such as cancer clusters, unexplained deaths, potential exacerbation of existing health conditions, and the future health of their children. They expressed feelings of stress and anxiety about living with uncertainty related to the possible health and the socio-economic impacts of PFAS contamination in their communities. Conclusion While research has concentrated on the physical health effects of PFAS, more attention needs to be given to the immediate psychosocial impacts of living in an affected community. © 2021 Banwell et al.

As we are exposed to complex mixtures of POPs, we aimed to investigate how a POP mixture based on Scandinavian human blood data affects behaviour and neurodevelopment during early life in zebrafish. Embryos/larvae were exposed to a series of sub-lethal doses and behaviour was examined at 96 h post fertilization (hpf). In order to determine the sensitivity window to the POP mixture, exposure models of 6 to 48 and 48 to 96 hpf were used. The expression of genes related to neurological development was also assessed. Results indicate that the POP mixture increases the swimming speed of larval zebrafish following exposure between 48 to 96 hpf. This behavioural effect was associated with the perfluorinated compounds, and more specifically with perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). The expression of genes related to the stress response, GABAergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic systems and neuronal maintenance, were altered. However, there was little overlap in those genes that were significantly altered by the POP mixture and PFOS. Our findings show that the POP mixture and PFOS can have a similar effect on behaviour, yet alter the expression of genes relevant to neurological development differently. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",NA,10.3390/ijms18020291,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Persistent organic pollutants;Animals;Article;Gene Expression Profiling;Transcriptome;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;controlled study;persistent organic pollutant;water pollutant;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;gene;gene expression;genetics;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;embryo;human;perfluorononanoic acid;Neurotoxicity;zebra fish;real time polymerase chain reaction;genetic transcription;Zebrafish;organic compound;animal behavior;gene expression profiling;gene expression regulation;Gene Expression Regulation;messenger RNA;swimming;transcriptome;drug effects;behavior;Organic Chemicals;Cluster Analysis;Water Pollutants;fertilization;Fertilization;Animal;Chemical;nerve cell differentiation;adverse effects;larva;Larva;Behavior;cluster analysis;Zebrafish larvae;bdnf gene;Behavioural;chrna7 gene;crhb gene;gabra1 gene;hdc gene;hrh1 gene;manf gene;sertb gene;Swimming;Gene Expression,NA,NA

Fibers coated with a Nafion tubing were chosen due to a higher fiber-gas distribution constant and a higher Nafion thickness than fibers coated with Nafion solution, both leading to a higher amount of ammonia absorbed at equilibrium. The Nafion membrane-coated fiber absorbed approximately 20 times more than a commercial polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber. The isotopic fractionation between fiber and gas was 1.0117 +/- 0.0009 (standard deviation, SD, of all measurements) at an initial ammonia gas concentration of 21-210 muM. At 390 muM initial gas concentration it was slightly lower. When sampling from liquid samples, an ammonium concentration of 10 mM was needed to obtain a sufficient amount of ammonia absorbed. Modeling of the absorption at different temperatures showed that the absorption was approximately constant in the temperature range suitable for SPME experiments. Absorption at room temperature was therefore used for simplicity. A pilot study was conducted in which absorption was achieved from a single 9 muL droplet of sample. The preliminary results showed that delta(15)N analysis was possible for only 0.4-0.5 mumol of ammonium with a SD of 0.8parts per thousand (n = 5).

We aim to assess if differences in urbanisation affect ecological niche and contaminant concentrations in female herring gulls. Furthermore, we investigated maternal transfer from mothers to eggs for all the target compounds, including chlorinated paraffins (CPs) and cyclic volatile methyl siloxane (cVMSs), which to our knowledge have not been assessed in herring gulls previously. We compare concentrations of legacy and emerging contaminants and metals in blood and eggs between two herring gull colonies located 51 km apart, in the urban influenced Norwegian Oslofjord. While both colonies are within an urbanised area, the inner fjord is more so, as it is surrounded by Oslo, the capital and largest city in Norway Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen indicated a more marine ecological niche in the outer than the inner fjord colony, although with overlap. Persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentrations were similar in the inner and outer fjord colonies, while the short-chained chlorinated paraffins (SCCP), which are recently added to the Stockholm convention and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) varied, with higher concentrations of SCCP and the cVMS decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) in females and eggs of the inner fjord colony. Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) concentrations were higher in the outer fjord colony, likely linked to releases from a point-source (airport and waste management facility with open access to food waste). In blood, chlorinated paraffins contributed most the total lipophilic contaminants (inner: 78%, outer: 56%), while polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were the most abundant lipophilic contaminants in eggs (inner: 62%, outer: 46%). Dechloranes and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) were detected in few samples. Maternal transfer, assessed by egg to blood ratios, of cVMSs were similar to the POPs with mean log ratio 0.39 (D5), while it was lower for SCCPs, with log ratios-0.77. Our results indicate comparable POP exposure of the herring gulls in the inner and outer Oslofjord, likely due to overlap in ecological niches between the colonies and wide distribution of POPs. The differences between the colonies in concentrations of PFAS, cVMS and CPs shows that point source exposures and urban influence may be more important than ecological niche for these compounds.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106478,character(0),NA,NA

The information about their presence in urban water cycle is still limited. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and removal efficiency of eighteen PFASs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and drinking water plants (DWTPs) with different treatment processes. The results showed that both perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were the predominant compounds in the water phase of WWTPs and DWTPs, while PFOS was dominant in dewatered sludge of WWTPs. The average total PFASs concentrations in the three selected WWTPs were 19.6–232 ng/L in influents, 15.5–234 ng/L in effluents, and 31.5–49.1 ng/g dry weight in sludge. The distribution pattern of PFASs differed between the wastewater and sludge samples, indicating strong partition of PFASs with long carbon chains to sludge. In the WWTPs, most PFASs were not eliminated efficiently in conventional activated sludge treatment, while the membrane bio-reactor (MBR) and Unitank removed approximately 50% of long chain (C ≥ 8) perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The daily mass loads of total PFASs in WWTPs were in the range of 1956–24773 mg in influent and 1548–25085 mg in effluent. PFASs were found at higher concentrations in the wastewater from plant A with some industrial wastewater input than from the other two plants (plant B and plant C) with mainly domestic wastewater sources. Meanwhile, the average total PFASs concentrations in the two selected DWTPs were detected at 4.74–14.3 ng/L in the influent and 3.34–13.9 ng/L in the effluent. In DWTPs, only granular activated carbon (GAC) and powder activated carbon (PAC) showed significant removal of PFASs. The PFASs detected in the tap water would not pose immediate health risks in the short term exposure. The findings from this study showed that effective treatment technology should be applied to eliminate this group of chemicals in the urban water cycle based on the precautionary principle. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.045,Fluorocarbons;effluent;chemical pollutant;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;fluorocarbon;carbon;alkyl group;chemistry;Health risks;water pollutant;chemical compound;chlorination;risk assessment;adsorption;carboxylic acid derivative;drinking water;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;Potable water;priority journal;health hazard;health risk;Industrial water treatment;Sewage;waste water;Waste Water;Wastewater treatment;wastewater treatment plant;waste water treatment plant;biodegradation;water treatment;water supply;Efficiency;Effluents;Removal efficiencies;waste component removal;tap water;Activated carbon;Activated carbon treatment;Chains;sewage;Water Pollutants;Chemical;ozonation;activated sludge;Wastewater;Water Purification;Substance concentrations;Sewage pumping plants;Waste water treatment plants;water management;Water treatment plants;pollutant removal;wastewater treatment;Drinking water;activated carbon;Chemicals removal (water treatment);Mass load;water cycle;Activated sludge process;bioreactor;disinfection;Drinking water plants;Drinking water treatment plants;membrane reactor;Urban waters;Water cycle;water treatment plant;Drinking,NA,NA

Previous reviews by Butt et al. and Letcher et al. have covered studies on levels and trends of PFASs in the Arctic that were available to 2009. The purpose of this review is to focus on more recent work, generally published between 2009 and 2018, with emphasis on PFASs of emerging concern such as perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) and short-chain perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and their precursors. Atmospheric measurements over the period 2006–2014 have shown that fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) as well as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) are the most prominent PFASs in the arctic atmosphere, all with increasing concentrations at Alert although PFOA concentrations declined at the Zeppelin Station (Svalbard). Results from ice cores show generally increasing deposition of PFCAs on the Devon Ice cap in the Canadian arctic while declining fluxes were found in a glacier on Svalbard. An extensive dataset exists for long-term trends of long-chain PFCAs that have been reported in Arctic biota with some datasets including archived samples from the 1970s and 1980s. Trends in PFCAs over time vary among the same species across the North American Arctic, East and West Greenland, and Svalbard. Most long term time series show a decline from higher concentrations in the early 2000s. However there have been recent (post 2010) increasing trends of PFCAs in ringed seals in the Canadian Arctic, East Greenland polar bears and in arctic foxes in Svalbard. Annual biological sampling is helping to determine these relatively short term changes. Rising levels of some PFCAs have been explained by continued emissions of long-chain PFCAs and/or their precursors and inflows to the Arctic Ocean, especially from the North Atlantic. While the effectiveness of biological sampling for temporal trends in long-chain PFCAs and PFSAs has been demonstrated, this does not apply to the C4–C8–PFCAs, perfluorobutane sulfonamide (FBSA), or perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) which are generally present at low concentrations in biota. In addition to air sampling, sampling abiotic media such as glacial cores, and annual sampling of lake waters and seawater would appear to be the best approaches for investigating trends in the less bioaccumulative PFASs. © 2019 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.emcon.2019.06.002,"PFASs;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctanoic acid;Review;Biota;Contaminants;Seawater;Air;Long-range transport;Perfluorobutanoic acid;Ice caps;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylates;Perfluoroalkyl sulfonates;RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly I-C;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Polymethyl Methacrylate",NA,NA

Recent methodological breakthrough for extracting tree-ring alpha-cellulose directly from tree-ring cross-sectional laths drastically increased the throughput of tree-ring isotope data. In this paper, we evaluate our recently designed ""cross-section"" method. This method employs polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cases, enabling direct extraction of alpha-cellulose from 1-mm thick tree-ring laths, in combination with fixation sheets to prevent disintegration of freeze-dried alpha-cellulose laths. Perforated PTFE cases are easily producible at an affordable cost. They are made of commonly available lab consumables in catalogs and do not require specially made PTFE parts. Freeze-dried alpha-cellulose laths preserved distinct anatomical structure, enabling precise separation at the tree-ring boundaries. Once separated froma lath, tree-ring alpha-cellulose can beweighed directly into silver or tin capsules for analysis. We checked chemical purity of alpha-cellulose prepared by the cross-section method from five tree species (larch, pine, spruce, beech, and oak). Residual lignin and hemicellulose contents were quantitatively assessed by Fourier transforminfrared spectrometry and gas chromatography. The average chemical purity of alpha-cellulose laths from the five species was 94.5%, similar to the chemical purity of alpha-cellulose prepared with the standard Jayme-Wise method. Both oxygen and carbon isotope values of alpha-cellulose prepared by the cross-section method also closely matched those prepared by the standard method. We conclude that, by overhauling the method of alpha-cellulose preparation for tree-ring isotope analysis, we increased throughput of tree-ring oxygen and carbon isotope data without sacrificing sample purity.

Migratory estuarine fishes may be captured for consumption in areas distant to known contaminant sources, but exposure risk depends on how quickly contaminants are depurated. This baseline presents the outcomes from a novel experiment simulating the migration of a popular recreational fish species (Dusky Flathead, Platycephalus fuscus) following environmental exposure to PFAAs, and assessing depuration from edible muscle tissues. Over the 33-day experiment, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) concentrations declined slowly, with modelling suggesting that concentrations fell below the relevant screening value (5.2 μg kg−1) within ∼558 h (285–1372 h; 90 % CI).

By drawing on recent monitoring studies of European ESBs, we illustrate the role ESBs already play in assessing the state of ecosystems in Europe and how they help to make developments over time visible. The studies reveal the ubiquitous presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, ha-logenated flame retardants, chlorinated paraffns, plasticizers, cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes, UV-flters, pharmaceu-ticals, and microplastics in the European environment. Temporal trends demonstrate the effectiveness of European regulations on perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, pentabrominated diphenylethers and diethylhexyl phthalate, but also point to the rise of substitutes such as non-phthalate plasticizers and short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances. Other stud-ies are wake-up calls indicating the emergence of currently unregulated compounds such as long-chain chlorinated paraffns. Ecological studies show temporal trends in biometric parameters and stable isotope signatures that suggest long-term changes in environmental conditions. Studies on biodiversity of ecosystems using environmental DNA are still in their beginnings, but here too there is evidence of shifts in community composition that can be linked to chang-ing environmental conditions.

Trophic position and relative carbon sources were compared by analyzing stable nitrogen and carbon isotopes in muscle samples. Geometric mean concentrations of total C-9-C-15 perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) ranged from 8.8 to 84 ng/g wet weight, and C-9-C-11 PFCAs predominated. Perfluorooctane sulfonate was the dominant PFC measured, with concentrations ranging from 6.5 to 89 ng/g wet weight, contributing between 29 and 56% of the total PFC concentration. Overall, mean PFC concentrations were similar between populations, and differences were attributed largely to elevated levels in the Gjoa Haven (Rae Strait, central Canadian Arctic archipelago) and Inukjuak populations (eastern Hudson Bay) and to lower concentrations at Pangnirtung (Cumberland Sound, Baffin Island). Mean stable nitrogen isotope ratios (+/- 95% confidence intervals) ranged from 14.7 parts per thousand (+/- 0.3 parts per thousand) at Nain (Labrador) to 17.9 parts per thousand (+/- 0.7 parts per thousand) at Gjoa Haven, suggesting that all populations were within the same trophic level. Stable carbon isotope ratios varied widely between the seal populations, ranging from -22.9 parts per thousand (+/- 0.2 parts per thousand) at Gjoa Haven to -17.7 parts per thousand (+/- 0.4 parts per thousand) at Nain. The delta C-13 ratios from Gjoa Haven were significantly more depleted than those for other populations and may suggest a terrestrially based carbon source. The depleted stable carbon isotope ratio may explain the elevated PFC concentrations in the Gjoa Haven population. Analysis of covariance indicated that delta C-13 was a significant covariable for seven of nine seal populations for which delta C-13 values were available.

Here, an omics-based ecosurveillance approach was taken to investigate the impacts of PFAS pollution in freshwater turtles (Emydura macquarii macquarii). Four turtles were collected from an impacted waterway downstream from an industrial source of PFAS contamination in Queensland, Australia and analysed for 49 different PFAS. One turtle was collected from a suitable control site. PFAS concentrations were quantified in turtle serum using an established targeted methodology. The serum PFAS concentration was ten-fold greater at the impacted site (Σ49 PFAS 1933 ± 481 ng/mL) relative to the control sample (Σ49 PFAS 140 ng/mL). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; 889 ± 56 ng/mL) was 235 times higher in turtle serum than in the water that they were collected from (ΣPFAS 32.0 μg/L). Perfluorobutane sulfonamide (FBSA; 403 ± 83 ng/mL) and perfluorohexane sulfonamide (FHxSA; 550 ± 330 ng/mL) were also reported at substantial concentrations in the serum of impacted turtles. Biochemical profiles were analysed using a mixture of liquid chromatography triple quadrupole (QqQ) and quadrupole time-of-flight (QToF) mass spectrometry methodologies. These profiles demonstrated a positive correlation in the impacted turtles exposed to elevated PFAS with an enhanced purine metabolism, glycerophosphocholines and an innate immune response, which suggest an inflammation response, metabolic preservation and re-routing of central carbon metabolites. Conversely, lipid transport and binding activity were negatively correlated. Using these preliminary data, we were able to demonstrate the negative metabolic impact from PFAS mixtures on turtle metabolic health. With further research on a larger turtle cohort, omics-based data will contribute towards linking adverse outcome pathways for turtle populations exposed to PFAS mixtures. Moreover, expanding the use of ecosurveillance tools will inform mechanistic toxicological data for risk assessment and regulatory applications. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151264,Biochemistry;PFAS;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Animals;Sulfur compounds;Bioaccumulation;animal;fluorocarbon;Mixtures;bioaccumulation;water pollutant;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;alkanesulfonic acid;Risk assessment;turtle;Turtles;Metabolism;Metabolites;Population statistics;Lipidomics;fresh water;Water;Metabolomics;Fresh Water;Water Pollutants;Proteomics;Chemical;Environmental exposure;Molecular biology;'omics';Multi-omic;Multi-omics;Ecosurveillance;Metabolic health,NA,NA

Analytes were determined based on a simplified, sensitive and reliable solvent extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Ten target PFASs were found and the most frequently detected compounds with maximum concentration were PFOS (88%, 1.93 ng g–1), PFNA (55.4%; 6.76 ng g–1), PFHxS (39.8%; 0.36 ng g–1), and PFOA (16.9%; 0.15 ng g–1), respectively. The total PFASs concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 6.76 ng g–1, with a mean of 0.94 ng g–1. Significant differences of occurrence between vegetable oils and animal oils were demonstrated based on comparative analysis of the existing data. The investigation results showed that the effect of production reductions of PFOS and PFOA by regulatory was also reflected in edible oils. The dietary intakes of PFOS and PFOA for adults were estimated, which were lower than the available tolerable daily intake (TDI). Because of the global lack of food regulatory thresholds for most per- or polyfluoroalkyl compounds, it was difficult to draw any conclusion at this stage as to how human health is affected through exposure to these compounds.

This method was used to analyze diPAP, PFPA, and PFPIA levels in 102 residential dust samples collected in 2007-2008 from Vancouver, Canada. The results indicated a predominant and ubiquitous presence of diPAPs (frequency of detection 100%, mean and median Sigma diPAPs 7637 and 2215 ng/g). Previously measured median concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) in the same samples were 14-74 times lower than Sigma diPAP levels, i.e. 71 ng/g PFOS, 30 ng/g PFOA, and 152 ng/g Sigma FTOHs. PFPAs and PFPIAs were detected in 62% and 85% of samples, respectively, at concentrations nearly 3 orders of magnitude lower than diPAPs (median 2.3 ng/g Sigma PFPAs and 2.3 ng/g Sigma PFPIAs). PFECHS was detected in only 8% of dust samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of these compounds in indoor dust. In this study, diPAP concentrations represented 98% +/- 7% of the total measured analytes in the dust samples. Detection of diPAPs at such high concentrations in indoor dust may represent an important and as-yet unrecognized indirect source of PFCA exposure in humans, given the identified biotransformation pathways.

This thesis investigated distribution of PFASs and organofluorine in freshwater environments impacted by PFAS point sources. The main focus was to study potential transfer of PFASs from freshwater systems to riparian zones via emergent aquatic insects as well as potential impacts on riparian invertebrate consumers. Comprehensive sets of samples, such as aquatic insect larvae, emergent aquatic insects, terrestrial invertebrate consumers and water were collected from mainly two sites in Sweden, Ronneby Airport and Kvarntorp industrial area. Homologue and branched isomer profiles, estimates of mass discharges, bioaccumulation factors, stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen as well as organofluorine mass balance and suspect screening analysis were used to characterize the distribution of PFASs in these freshwater environments including their aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate food webs. Results revealed elevated PFAS concentrations in emergent aquatic insects and riparian invertebrate consumers, especially in spiders. Calculated biodriven transfers indicated that impact on riparian insectivores could be substantial on a local and seasonal scale. Furthermore, PFAS concentrations in terrestrial consumers were related to aquatic-based diet and trophic levels, indicating that biomagnification was a major pathway of uptake for some PFASs. Organofluorine mass balance could be closed for most aquatic and for some terrestrial invertebrates from the Ronneby site by target PFAS analysis, whereas a fraction of 50% in surface water was unidentified organofluorine.

We expected OCs to have reached stable equilibrium levels due to bans, and that recent phase-out of some PFASs would have slowed the increase of these compounds. ∑OC comprised on average approximately 92% of the measured compounds, whereas ∑PFAS accounted for approximately 8%. However, whereas the ∑OC to ∑PFAS ratio was approximately 60 in the first 5 years of the study, it was only approximately 11 in the last 5 years. Both OC pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) showed substantial declines over the study period ( 85%–98%): hexachlorocyclohexanes and chlordanes seemed to be levelling off, whereas p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE) and hexachlororbenzene (HCB), and most PCB congeners still seemed to decline at a more or less constant rate. While the concentration of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), the dominating PFAS, was reduced by approximately 43%, other perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs) showed only minor changes. Moreover, the median concentrations of seven perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) increased approximately five-fold over the study period. Perfluorononanoic acid and perfluoroundecanoate acid, however, seemed to be levelling off in recent years. In contrast, perfluorododecanoic acid, perfluorodecanoate acid, perfluorotridecanoic acid, and perfluorotetradecanoic acid seemed to increase more or less linearily. Finally, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was increasingly likely to be detected over the study period. Hence, most legacy OCs and PFOS have not reached a lower threshold with stable background levels, and voluntary elimination of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates still has not resulted in declining levels in tawny owls in central Norway.

Compounds studied include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OC pesticides), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and were analyzed using mass spectrometric based techniques. The results showed a high contamination by PCBs in all colonies, with total levels ranging from 59 to 1278 ng/g wet weight (ww), despite their use is not currently authorized. OC pesticides were also present in all colonies, with a high incidence of 4,4′-DDE in gull eggs at levels up to 218 ± 50 ng/g ww in L. michahellis and 760 ± 412 ng/g ww in L. audouinii from the Ebro Delta natural park.

The concentrations of the measured contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the e-waste soil differs significantly from the reference soil with chemical profiles typically dominated by legacy polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (405.8 μgkg−1) and emerging organophosphate ester flame retardant tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP) (404 μgkg−1), in addition to the short chain perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) (275.3 μgkg−1) and perfluorobutanoate (PFBA) (16 μgkg−1). The study revealed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) occurred only in e-waste soil from Ghana and ranged from 2.6 to 5.0 μgkg−1. Overall, non-polar e-waste soil-derived extracts had a stronger effect on COS-7 cell viability than the polar extracts and elutriates. The highest receptor activation was observed with single polar and non-polar extracts from the Nigeria and Benin sites, indicating hotspots with Er-, PPARa- and Ahr-agonist activities. Thus, the results obtained with our battery of in vitro biological assays underscored these e-waste sites as remarkably polluted spots with complex toxicity profiles of great concern for human and environmental health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159068,Humans;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers;Ghana;animal;concentration (parameter);nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;Organic pollutants;polybrominated diphenyl ether;environmental monitoring;persistent organic pollutant;in vitro study;perfluoro compound;perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);flame retardant;procedures;toxicity;Toxicity;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha;human;soil;bioassay;Soil;soil pollution;Soil surveys;Soils;diphenyl ether derivative;animal cell;perfluorobutane sulfonate;perfluorobutanoate;analysis;Africa;soil pollutant;Soil Pollutants;cell viability;cytology;Nigeria;soil analysis;aromatic hydrocarbon receptor;In-vitro;estrogen receptor alpha;Chemical activation;Cytotoxicity;electronic waste;Electronic Waste;Wastes;cell;e-waste;e-waste soil;Biological Assay;Atlantic cod;soil quality;contaminants of emerging concern;aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 alpha;Benin;Benin [West Africa];Biological assays;cell assay;cell based biassay;COS-7 cell line;cytotoxicity test;E-waste soil;E-wastes;Electric batteries;luciferase assay;Luciferase assay;Luciferase assays;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha 1;Stress-activated receptor;Stress-activated receptors;tris (1 chloro 2 propyl) phosphate;Waste sites;Waste soils;West Africa,NA,NA

The present study was designed to investigate the effects of Pyropia yezoensis peptide (PYP), a peptide comprised of 11 residues (ALEGGKSSGGG), on PFOS-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in Chang cells. PFOS exposure (400 μM) for 24 h significantly decreased cell viability, which was upregulated by 250-1,000 pg/ml PYP treatment. Exposure to PFOS also signifcantly increased expression of the ER stress response protein, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). These elevations were signifcantly decreased by PYP (250 pg/ml), and, in particular, the PFOS-induced GRP78 upregulation was decreased following treatment with 10 μM SL327, an ERK-kinase inhibitor. However, PYP-induced decreases in GRP78 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were upregulated following treatment with LY294002 (20 μM), a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. PFOS-induced apoptosis was also signifcantly attenuated by PYP (250 pg/ml) treatment, and the PYP-induced reduction in apoptosis was abolished by inhibition of PI3K.

However, knowledge gaps exist on the ecological risks of alternatives and relationships between restrictions and emissions. This study systematically analyzed the occurrence characteristics, water-sediment partitioning behaviors, ecological risks, and emissions of legacy and alternative PFASs in the Bohai Bay Rim (BBR). The mean concentration of total PFASs was 46.105 ng/L in surface water and 6.125 ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediments. As an alternative for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) had a concentration second only to PFOA in surface water. In sediments, perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA) and GenX were the two predominant contaminants. In the water-sediment partitioning system, GenX, 9-chlorohexadecafluoro-3-oxanone-1-sulfonic acid (F-53B), and 11-chloroeicosafluoro-3-oxaundecane-1-sulfonic acid (8:2 Cl-PFESA) tended to be enriched towards sediments. The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) models revealed the low ecological risks of PFASs and their alternatives in the BBR. Moreover, predicted no-effected concentrations (PNECs) indicated that short-chain alternatives like PFBA and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) were safer for aquatic ecosystems, while caution should be exercised when using GenX and F-53B. Due to the incremental replacement of PFOA by GenX, cumulative emissions of 1317.96 kg PFOA and 667.22 kg GenX were estimated during 2004–2022, in which PFOA emissions were reduced by 59.2 % due to restrictions implemented since 2016. If more stringent restrictions are implemented from 2023 to 2030, PFOA emissions will further decrease by 85.0 %, but GenX emissions will increase by an additional 21.3 %. Simultaneously, GenX concentrations in surface water are forecasted to surge by 2.02 to 2.45 times in 2023.

Design: We used cross-sectional data from the JES-YEH! project conducted in collaboration with four First Nation communities in 2015. A FFQ collected information on diet, and PFAA and BPA were measured in biological samples. We used generalised linear models to test the associations between food intake and chemical biomarkers. Setting: Northern Quebec. Participants: Youth aged 3-19 years (n 198). Results: Mean perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) levels were significantly higher in JES-YEH! than CHMS, and BPA levels were higher among those aged 12-19 years compared with CHMS. Dairy products were associated with PFNA among Anishinabe and Innu participants (geometric mean ratio 95 % CI: 1·53 (95 % CI 1·03, 2·29) and 1·52 (95 % CI 1·05, 2·20), respectively).

With properties such as oil and water repellence, temperature resistance and a long lifespan they have been frequently used in various areas, e.g. hygiene products such as shampoo and tooth paste as well as in the firefighting industry as firefighting foam. They are therefore commonly found in leachate from landfills. Up to now, there is a lack of studies investigating methods of how to treat PFAS-contaminated leachate and hence more research in this area and development of suitable treatment technologies is needed. In this study, column experiments with granulated activated carbon (GAC), anion exchanger (AE) resin and peat mixed with ash were performed. The results showed that AE removed PFAS more efficiently than GAC, that longer chains had a higher sorption ability than shorter chains and that perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) a higher sorption ability than perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The peat-ash columns had a slower flow and only 5bed volumes (BVs) of leachate were treated. Hence, these results could not be compared with GAC and AE. For GAC and AE 1920 BVs and 1840 BVs, respectively, were treated and none of the filters got fully saturated. The conclusion of the study is that AE is likely a more suitable treatment technology for this purpose than GAC but more research is needed to determine the breakthrough and design PFAS treatment for leachate. ; Under det senaste decenniet har per- och polyfluorerade alkylsubstanser (PFAS) blivit mer och mer uppmärksammade på grund av deras spridning till människa och miljö och den risk denna spridning innebär.

While previous studies have demonstrated that populations of some organisms proximal to urban centers may display increased burdens of human-created chemicals compared to more distal populations, this relationship may not be universal when applied to organisms and stressors capable of transboundary movements. We examined eggs of brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), a nearshore seabird with daily movements ranging from local to 50 km and annual migrations ranging from year-round residency to 1500 km. Thirty-six eggs from three breeding colonies located at increasing distances to a major urban center (Charleston, South Carolina, USA) were analyzed for concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Areas of high use for each colony during the breeding season were also assessed via the tracking of adult pelicans from each colony using GPS-PTT satellite transmitters and overlapped with measures of relative urbanization via land cover data. We report potentially significant ∑PFAS concentrations in the eggs of pelicans (175.4 ± 120.1 ng/g w wt. SD), driven largely by linear perfluorooctane sulfonate (n-PFOS) (48–546 ng/g w wt.).

For most analytes, egg concentrations did not exhibit a significant spatial structure despite some differentiation in high-use areas unlike similar data for another regional apex predator, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). We suggest that the partially migratory nature of brown pelicans during the non-breeding season, combined with daily ranges that may extend to 50 km from local point sources, may have homogenized exposure across individuals. Charleston likely remains a major source for PFAS in the overall region, however, given the high concentrations observed as well as known releases of PFAS in the nearshore environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150110,Biology;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Eggs;Fluorocarbons;Birds;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Sulfur compounds;Breeding;United States;animal;concentration (parameter);environmental chemical;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;seabird;Seabird;unclassified drug;bird;controlled study;environmental monitoring;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;breeding;geographic distribution;egg;pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;Bottle-Nosed Dolphin;bottlenose dolphin;Breeding season;brooding (eggs);Brown pelican;Brown pelicans;Charleston;Chemical stressors;global positioning system;Global positioning system;GPS;land use;migrant bird;migration;Nearshores;oxidative stress;Pelecanidae;Pelecanus occidentalis;perfluoroalkyl substance;perfluorooctane sulfonamide;population dynamics;reproductive behavior;Rosa carolina carolina;source apportionment;South Carolina;surfactant;Tracking;Tursiops;Tursiops truncatus;Urban;urban area;Urban centers;urbanization;water pollution;wildlife;Ovum,NA,NA

This study evaluated the spatial distribution of 17 PFAS within the ten major river basins in Alabama and provided insights into their transport and fate through a mass flux analysis. Six PFAS were identified in 65 out of the 74 riverine samples, with mean ∑6PFAS levels of 35.2 ng L−1. The highest ∑6PFAS concentration of 237 ng L−1 was detected in the Coosa River, a transboundary river that receives discharges from multiple sources in Alabama and Georgia. PFAS distribution was not observed to be uniform across the state: while the Coosa, Alabama, and Chattahoochee rivers presented relatively high mean ∑6PFAS concentrations of 191, 100 and 28.8 ng L−1, respectively, PFAS were not detected in the Conecuh, Escatawpa, and Yellow rivers. Remaining river systems presented mean ∑6PFAS concentrations between 7.94 and 24.7 ng L−1. Although the short-chain perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) was the most detected analyte (88%), perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) was the substance with the highest individual concentration of 79.4 ng L−1. Consistent increases in the mass fluxes of PFAS were observed as the rivers flowed through Alabama, reaching up to 63.3 mg s−1, indicating the presence of numerous sources across the state. Most of the mass inputs would not have been captured if only aqueous concentrations were evaluated, since concentration is usually heavily impacted by environmental conditions. Results of this study demonstrate that mass flux is a simple and powerful complementary approach that can be used to broadly understand trends in the transport and fate of PFAS in large river systems. © 2022",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155524,PFAS;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Rivers;wastewater;Persistent organic pollutants;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;United States;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;Organic pollutants;contamination;environmental monitoring;persistent organic pollutant;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;spatial distribution;Spatial distribution;alkanesulfonic acid;procedures;quantitative analysis;ultra performance liquid chromatography;water;organofluorine derivative;river;river basin;multiple reaction monitoring;electrospray;River pollution;environment;geography;spatial analysis;calibration;Water;Persistent organic pollutant;river pollution;accuracy;surface water;Water Pollutants;data analysis;Chemical;Alabama;Substance concentrations;pollutant removal;River basins;mass balance;Perfluoroalkyl Substance;removal experiment;mass transport;Chattahoochee River;Conecuh County;Flux analysis;hydrography;Mass flux;Pollutant transport;Pollutants transport;Spatial analysis;Transboundary rivers,NA,NA

We explored the hypothesis that nonracemic proportions of chiral PFOS in serum are qualitative and semiquantitative biomarkers of human PreFOS exposure. A new chiral HPLC-MS/MS method was developed for alpha-perfluoromethyl branched PFOS (1m-PFOS, typically 2-3% of total PFOS) and applied to enantiomer fraction (EF) analysis in biological samples. In blood and tissues of rodents exposed subchronically to electrochemical PFOS, 1m-PFOS was racemic (EF = 0.485-0.511) and no evidence for enantioselective excretion was found in this model mammal. 1m-PFOS in serum of pregnant women, from Edmonton, was significantly nonracemic, with a mean EF (+/- standard deviation). of 0.432 +/- 0.009, similar to pooled North American serum. In a highly exposed Edmonton family (mother, father, and S children) living in a house where ScotchGard had been applied repeatedly to carpet and upholstery,, EFs ranged from 035 to 043, significantly more nonracemic than in pregnant women. Semiquantitative estimates of % serum 1m-PFOS coming from 1m-PreFOS biotransformation in both subpopulations were in reasonable agreement with model predictions of human exposure to PFOS from PreFOS. The data were overall suggestive that the measured nonracemic EFs were influenced by the relative extent of exposure to PreFOS. The possibility of using 1m-PFOS EFs for assessing the relative contribution of 1m-PreFOS (or PreF OS in general) in biological samples requires further application before being fully validated, but could be a powerful tool for probing general sources of PFOS in environments where the importance of PreFOS is unknown.",NA,10.1021/es2023434,Humanism;Humanities;Humans,NA,NA

In contrast to legacy PFASs, novel congeners (e.g., Gen X) were either detected infrequently or not found in Baikal seals. The worldwide occurrence of PFASs in pinnipeds was compared and lower median concentrations of PFOS were observed in Baikal seals relative to other pinnipeds. Conversely, similar concentrations of long chain PFCAs were found in Baikal seals compared to other pinnipeds. Furthermore, human exposure was assessed by estimating weekly intakes (EWI) of PFASs through Baikal seal consumption. Although PFASs concentrations were comparatively low relative to other pinnipeds, consumption of Baikal seal could exceed current regulatory guidelines. © 2023",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164096,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;Tissue Distribution;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;plasma;bioaccumulation;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Mammals;chemical compound;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctane sulfonamide;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;risk assessment;Tissue;brain;biota;liver;mass spectrometry;human;ultra performance liquid chromatography;Adult;child;carboxylic acid;blood sampling;polyfluoroalkyl substance;tissue distribution;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluoroheptanoic acid;perfluoropentanoic acid;animal model;Lakes;Wildlife;perflubutane;Phoca;pinniped;Pinnipedia;Russian Federation;blood brain barrier;Perfluorochemicals;Halichoerus grypus;data analysis;Perfluorochemical;2;1;3;solid phase microextraction;Aquatic biota;marine mammal;Marine mammals;Cystophora cristata;Perfluorochemicals (PFCs);Polyfluorinated substance;Polyfluorinated substances;per;perfluoro 3;2 (N ethylperfluorooctane 1 sulfonamido)ethyl phosphate;3 heptafluoropropoxy)propanoate;3 tetrafluoro 2 (1;7 dimethyloctanoic acid;7H dodecafluoroheptanoic acid;8 dioxanoanoate;9 chlorohexadecafluoro 3 oxanonane 1 sulfonate;Baikal seal;bis[2 (N ethylperfluorooctane 1 sulfonamido)ethyl] phosphate;Callorhinus ursinus;Caniformia;chemical agent;HybridSPE;Lake Baikal;Mirounga leonina;N (2 hydroxyethyl) N methylperfluoro octane sulfonamide;N ethyl N (2 hydroxyethyl) N methylper fluorooctane sulfonamide;N ethylperfluoro 1 octanesulfonamide;N methylperfluoro 1 octanesulfonamide;perfluoro 1 tetradecanoic acid;perfluoro n hexadecanoic acid;Phoca groenlandica;Pinniped;Pinnipeds;sodium dodecafluoro 3H 4;Zalophus californianus,NA,NA

Perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) is one of the major intermediates of higher molecular weight PreFOS. Its further degradation to PFOS could be isomer specific and thereby explain unexpected high percentages of branched (Br-) PFOS isomers observed in wildlife. In this study, isomeric degradation of PFOSA was concomitantly investigated by in vivo and in vitro tests using common carp as an animal model. In the in vivo tests branched isomers of PFOSA and PFOS were eliminated faster than the corresponding linear (n-) isomers, leading to enrichment of n-PFOSA in the fish. In contrast, Br-PFOS was enriched in the fish, suggesting that Br-PFOSA isomers were preferentially metabolized to Br-PFOS over n-PFOSA. This was confirmed by the in vitro test. The exception was 1m-PFOSA, which could be the most difficult to be metabolized due to its α-branched structure, resulting in the deficiency of 1m-PFOS in the fish. The in vitro tests indicated that the metabolism mainly took place in the fish liver instead of its kidney, and it was mainly a Phase I reaction. The results may help to explain the special PFOS isomer profile observed in wildlife. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.5b00488,Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;exposure;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonamide;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Sulfur compounds;Liver;Sulfonamides;Environmental Exposure;Biotransformation;Kidney;animal;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;bioaccumulation;chemistry;in vitro study;in vivo study;water pollutant;Biomarkers;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;liver;environmental fate;mortality;kidney;growth rate;metabolism;organofluorine;carp;Carps;Animalia;biotransformation;sulfonamide;Isomers;extraction;isomer;degradation;Cyprinus carpio;cyprinid;perfluorooctanesulfonamide;drug effects;perfluorooctane;pharmacokinetics;Branched isomers;Isomerism;Plants (botany);Water Pollutants;Chemical;isomerism;Animal model;Branched structures;Common carp;drug inactivation;In Vitro Techniques;In-vitro tests;In-vivo tests;Inactivation;Metabolic,NA,NA

For both PFA and ClO 2 , the degradation in water was faster than for PAA, H 2 O 2 and chlorite. Using these data together with literature values, we derived environmental quality standards. By combining these with typical concentrations of disinfectants used for CSOs, we estimated the dilution required for discharging CSOs after disinfection, which can be used for quick assessment of the environmental feasibility of disinfection systems at specific CSO sites. Minimal dilutions in the receiving water, in the orders of 44, 70 or 138-fold, are needed for ClO 2 , PFA and PAA, respectively. This highlights PFA as the most widely applicable disinfectant, taking into account both its efficiency and the lower risk of unwanted environmental effects.

A factory producing paper products and a fire station were investigated as possible sources. Fire station emissions were dominated by the eight carbon perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid (PFSA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), from aqueous film forming foams. Factory emissions contained PFOS, PFOS precursors (preFOS and SAmPAP), long chained fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTS), and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA). Concentrations and profiles in sediments and biota indicated that emissions originating from the factory were the main source of pollution in the lake, while no clear indication of fire station emissions was found. Ratios of linear-to branched-PFOS increased with distance from the factory, indicating that isomer profiles can be used to trace a point source. A dated sediment core contained higher concentrations in older sediments and indicated that two different PFAS products have been used at the factory, referred to here as Scotchban and FTS mixture. Modelling, based on the sediment concentrations, indicated that 42–189 tons Scotchban, and 2.4–15.6 tons FTS mixture, were emitted.

In Brazil, the PFOS-precursor N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (EtFOSA) is used in Sulfluramid, a pesticide for controlling leaf-cutting ants. New data on production, environmental fate, and occurrence of Brazilian Sulfluramid are reported herein. From 2003 to 2013, Brazilian Sulfluramid manufacturing increased from 30 to 60 tonnes yr-1 EtFOSA. During this time <1.3 tonnes yr-1 were imported, while exports increased from ∼0.3 to 2 tonnes yr-1. From 2004 to 2015, most EtFOSA was exported to Argentina (7.2 tonnes), Colombia (2.07 tonnes), Costa Rica (1.13 tonnes), Equador (2.16 tonnes), and Venezuela (2.4 tonnes). Within Brazil, sales occurred primarily in the states of Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Espírito Santo, and Bahia. Model simulations predict EtFOSA will partition to soils, while transformation products perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and PFOS are sufficiently mobile to leach into surface waters. In support of these predictions, up to 3400 pg L-1 of FOSA and up to 1100 pg L-1 of PFOS were measured in Brazilian surface water, while EtFOSA was not detected. The high FOSA/PFOS ratio observed here (up to 14:1) is unprecedented in the scientific literature to our knowledge. Depending on the extent of conversion of EtFOSA, cumulative Brazilian Sulfluramid production and import from 2004 to 2015 may contribute between 167 and 487 tonnes of PFOS/FOSA to the environment.

The concentrations of 3 perfluorinated substances [perfluorooctane sulfonate acid(PFOS),perfluorooctanoic acid(PFOA),perfluorohexanesulfonic acid(PFHxS)]and 2 chlorine substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate acids(6:2 Cl-PFESA and 8:2 Cl-PFESA)in fresh vegetables were detected using isotope dilution method by UPLC-QqQ-MS,and the point estimate was employed to estimate the levels of dietary exposure from fresh vegetables. Results PFOS and PFOA were detected in all samples,while chlorine substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates were detected in 2 leafy vegetable samples. The sum of average concentration of PFASs and Cl-PFESAs in vegetable samples was 0. 792 ng/g fw(fresh weight,fw),and it was two-fold higher compared the samples around the fluorine chemical industrial with the samples from local markets. The average concentration of 5 chemicals (1. 11 ng/g fw)was the highest in leafy vegetables.

In the present study, we examine trends (1990/1991-2010/2011) in aquatic birds (ancient murrelet, Synthliboramphus antiquus [2009 only]; Leach's storm-petrels, Oceanodroma leucorhoa; rhinoceros auklets, Cerorhinca monocerata; double-crested cormorants, Phalacrocorax auritus; and great blue herons, Ardea herodias). The PFCA, PFSA, and stable isotope (N-15 and C-13) data collected from these species from the Pacific coast of Canada, ranging over 20 to 30years, were used to investigate temporal changes in PFAS coupled to dietary changes. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), the dominant PFSA compound in all 4 species, increased and subsequently decreased in auklet and cormorant eggs in line with the manufacturing phase-out of PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), but concentrations continuously increased in petrel eggs and remained largely unchanged in heron eggs. Dominant PFCA compounds varied between the offshore and coastal species, with increases seen in the offshore species and little or variable changes seen in the coastal species. Little temporal change was seen in stable isotope values, indicating that diet alone is not driving observed PFAS concentrations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:1799-1808.

Understanding the distribution of and ecological risks posed by PFASs is critical, particularly for PFAS emissions and accumulation from a common urban pollution source. The transformation characteristics and ecological risks of PFASs from a typical aging municipal landfill leachate were systematically monitored and assessed over five years in this study. The results showed that the total PFAS concentrations (ΣPFASs) in the rivers were between 26.4 and 464.3 ng/L, whereas in sediment, ΣPFASs ranged from 9.5 to 58.5 ng/g (w/w). The presence of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the most prominent PFAS in both water (39.4–152.3 ng/L) and sediment (1.1–56.1 ng/g). In a five-year monitoring study, the concentration of PFASs in the aging landfill decreased by 23.3%, with higher mean concentrations observed during summer (307.6 ng/L) compared to winter (250.4 ng/L). As for the pollution distribution, the suspended particulate matter–water partition coefficient (log Kd) of carboxylic acid (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) ranged from 1.53 to 2.65, and from 1.77 to 2.82, respectively. PFSAs and long-chain PFCAs exhibited a greater propensity for sediment association compared to short-chain PFCAs. An ecological risk assessment of four typical PFASs, PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), utilizing the hazard quotient method revealed that the rivers surrounding the typical aging landfill exhibited a low contamination risk for PFOA, while no ecological risks were associated with the other three FPASs. This study contributes to an enhanced comprehension of the occurrence, distribution, and risk of PFASs in the rivers in rivers and sediment surrounding a typical aging landfill site in China, thereby providing crucial reference information for ensuring water quality safety. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,10.3390/toxics11100852,Article;China;controlled study;contamination;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;quality control;urbanization;high performance liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;risk assessment;carboxylic acid;suspended particulate matter;aquatic environment;landfill;environmental protection;partition coefficient;landfill leachate;tetrabutylammonium;water quality;comprehension;ecological assessment;perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);the hazard quotient method (HQ);the suspended particulate matter–water partition coefficient (log K<sub>d</sub>),NA,NA

Its bioaccumulation and toxicity in aquatic organisms can be affected by both the chemical status of PFOA in water and the physiology of the organism. However, research on the patterns of these effects is scarce. In this study, we investigated the influence of aqueous pH (pH 6, acidic; pH 7.5, neutral; pH 9, basic) and fish sex on PFOA uptake, clearance, and biochemical effects in crucian carp (C. auratus) using flow-through exposure. In the 17-d kinetic experiment, PFOA bioaccumulation adhered to a uniform first-order model in which PFOA uptake rates from water to blood and liver in acidic conditions were faster than those in other conditions, indicating possible acidic pH influence on PFOA uptake. PFOA clearance rates in these compartments of males were slower than in females, which was attributed to the notably stronger expression of Oat2 (organic anion transporter 2, responsible for reabsorption) in the kidneys of males. Similar responses were observed for peroxisome proliferation-related biomarkers at different pH levels and in different sexes. These biochemical responses were driven by the internal concentrations of PFOA. The inhibition acetylcholinesterase activity in the fish brain was closely linked to changes in P-glycoprotein content, demonstrating a protective relationship. Collectively, an aqueous pH lower than 7.5 might affect the uptake of PFOA by fish. The clearance discrepancies between the sexes highlight the importance of anion carriers for ionizable organic compounds in aquatic organisms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160567,Biochemistry;Fish;Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Bioaccumulation;Brain;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;animal experiment;blood analysis;controlled study;sex difference;bioaccumulation;persistent organic pollutant;animal tissue;water pollutant;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;gene;liver tissue;toxicity;Cytology;water;kidney tissue;metabolism;neurotoxicity;protein function;octanoic acid;aqueous solution;Caprylates;PFOA;depuration;carp;Carps;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;pH;Depuration;gene expression regulation;goldfish;brain tissue;cyprinid;biological uptake;biochemistry;cell proliferation;aquatic species;Water;kinetics;acidity;Water Pollutants;cholinergic system;Acetylcholinesterase;Glycoproteins;peroxisome;Chemical;Aquatic environments;Uptake;Tissue-specific accumulation;freshwater fish;gender;acetylcholinesterase;ABC transporter subfamily B;Biochemical effects;C aurati;C. auratus;Chemical status;Clearance;clearance rate;Crucian carp;organic anion transporter 2 gene;Organ Specificity,NA,NA

Persistent unmetabolized FA has been found even in plasma from fasted subjects. To facilitate measurement of low levels of folic acid in human plasma, post-column coulometric oxidative cleavage was used to convert poorly fluorescent FA into a highly fluorescent compound determined to be 6-formyl-pterin. To minimize sample work-up and maximize recovery, column-switching HPLC transferred a window of eluate containing the FA from the first column (C8) onto a second column (phenyl-hexyl). The pH of two mobile phases were adjusted to be above and then below a pK of the FA alpha-carboxyl group, thus promoting separation from compounds coeluting from the C8-column. This permitted sample preparation using only a simple high recovery protein precipitation. Definitive identification of FA in human plasma was accomplished by duplicate injections of sample with the electrochemical voltage set above and below its half-potential. The LOD (S/N = 3) was 0.10 nM. The intra- and inter-assay CV's were 2.3% and 5%, respectively. Comparison of these results with those obtained by HPLC/MS/MS with stable isotope internal standard showed a slope of 1.00 +/- 0.019. This simple, sensitive, and repeatable assay facilitates a more thorough investigation of the response of various human populations to folic acid intake.

This review aims to (1) identify PFAS sources and fate processes relevant to agricultural systems and (2) expand on plant uptake mechanisms and plant responses to PFAS. Recent Findings The number of PFAS being quantified in studies involving soil, water, and plants is increasing. Transformation of precursors that tend to stay in the rhizosphere can lead to long-term PFAS reservoir to plants. Some PFAS are readily taken up, particularly the shorter-chain PFAS, and can evoke metabolic responses and phytotoxic effects at high concentrations. PFAS translocation from roots to shoots occurs through both active and passive transport mechanisms. Both PFAS uptake and effects vary between and within species. As new PFAS emerge, it will be necessary to continue expanding the list of PFAS quantified in land-applied media and assessing their accumulation potential in plants. While controlled laboratory or greenhouse studies have merit, comprehensive field studies are needed to provide clarity on PFAS fate and their relative risk in agricultural systems. Field studies should include identifying site-specific PFAS sources, quantifying a broader suite of PFAS and identifying potential precursors, evaluating plant uptake of replacement PFAS, reporting of soil properties and climatic conditions, and assessing risk of impacts to source and irrigation waters. This information can be utilized to inform future studies towards evaluating and mitigating risks to our food chain associated with PFAS in agricultural systems.",NA,10.1007/s40726-020-00168-y,character(0),NA,NA

Detection of PFCs at relatively great concentrations in various environmental matrices from this region suggested that further studies characterizing concentrations of PFCs, their sources and potential risk to both humans and wildlife are needed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.05.029,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;Risk Assessment;unclassified drug;controlled study;environmental monitoring;perfluoro compound;Coastal area;fish;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;urban area;high performance liquid chromatography;perflexane;perfluorohexanoic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;biota;mass spectrometry;Perfluorinated compounds;Environmental matrixes;article;Biota;organofluorine derivative;Soil;soil pollution;Soils;Pacific Ocean;seashore;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluoroheptanoic acid;organofluorine;sediment;river;PFOA;organic compound;Geologic Sediments;perflubutane;concentration (parameters);pollutant source;soil analysis;estuarine species;Water;Octanoic Acids;Anoxic sediments;Sedimentology;water content;Water Pollutants;water quality;Coastal zones;Chemical;sediments;estuarine pollution;Potential risks;Bohai Sea;Yellow Sea;coastal water;Point sources;Oceans;Seas;Liaohe River;HPLC-MS;River systems;Threshold concentrations,NA,NA

Previous small scale studies found high concentrations of POPs in adult great skuas, Stercorarius skua, a top predator in the marine environment. This thesis investigates the factors affecting concentrations and patterns of POPs (contribution of individual POPs to the ΣPOPs) in the great skua across its breeding range in the north-east Atlantic. Clear differences between colonies in both concentration and pattern of POPs in adult plasma were not indicative of being caused by long range transport of POPs in the atmosphere. Variation in diet between colonies is the mostly likely explanation for these colony differences, with great skuas from some colonies having a greater proportion of fish in their diet whilst others eat more seabird prey. Although seabirds are often used in studies of POPs in the environment, the effect of migratory behaviour has not previously been studied in detail. By using a combination of global location sensor (GLS) loggers and feather stable isotopes from winter grown feathers, the wintering areas of individuals from three breeding populations of great skuas were identified. Great skuas spend the winter in three distinct areas across the North Atlantic, with birds from the same breeding colonies wintering in different areas. In two of the three breeding populations, wintering area explained a significant proportion of variation in organochlorines (OCs) concentrations and pattern. However in the colony with the highest concentrations of OCs, no effect of wintering area was found, possibly as a result of these great skuas feeding at a higher trophic level during the breeding season than other populations. Temporally, concentrations of OCs were higher in 1980 than 2008 in eggs, whilst newer contaminants polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFASs) show the opposite ...",NA,NA,QL Zoology,NA,NA

Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, wood must be homogenized, and a convenient method involves a ball mill capable of milling samples directly in sample tubes. However, sample-tube plastic can contaminate wood during milling, which could lead to biological misinterpretations. METHODS: We tested possible contamination of whole wood and cellulose samples during ball-mill homogenization for carbon and oxygen isotope measurements. We used a multi-factorial design with two/three steel milling balls, two sample amounts (10 mg, 40 mg), and two milling times (5 min, 10 min). We further analyzed abrasion by milling empty tubes, and measured the isotope ratios of pure contaminants. RESULTS: A strong risk exists for carbon isotope bias through plastic contamination: the delta C-13 value of polypropylene deviated from the control by -6.77%. Small fibers from PTFE filter bags used during cellulose extraction also present a risk as the delta C-13 value of this plastic deviated by -5.02%. Low sample amounts (10 mg) showed highest contamination due to increased abrasion during milling (-1.34%), which is further concentrated by cellulose extraction (-3.38%). Oxygen isotope measurements were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: A ball mill can be used to homogenize samples within test tubes prior to oxygen isotope analysis, but not prior to carbon or radiocarbon isotope analysis. There is still a need for a fast, simple and contamination-free sample preparation procedure. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",NA,10.1002/rcm.7585,character(0),NA,NA

The 26 investigated compounds included perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (C5–C14 PFCAs), perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (C4, C6, C7, C8, C10 PFSAs), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and N-alkyl derivatives (MeFOSA, EtFOSA), N-alkyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acids (MeFOSAA, EtFOSAA), fluorotelomer sulfonates (4:2 FTSA, 6:2 FTSA, 8:2 FTSA), polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diesters (diPAPs) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide phosphate diester (diSAmPAP). The method described herein requires a reduced sample amount (25 μL) and involves rapid and simple sample preparation (protein precipitation with acetonitrile but without acidification) prior to analysis by on-line solid phase extraction (Oasis HLB sorbent) coupled to high performance liquid chromatography negative electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The optimization was conducted using experimental designs to account for potential interactions between variables. Out of the 26 target analytes, 23 compounds showed excellent accuracy (± 25% of the expected values). Intermediate precision and matrix effects remained acceptable for most analytes thanks to efficient internal standardization. A human serum standard reference material (NIST SRM 1957) was included in the validation scheme to evaluate method trueness, which proved satisfactory (│Z-scores│<2 for most compounds). Notwithstanding the small initial sample intake, limits of detection as low as 0.003–0.1 ng g−1 plasma were obtained. This allowed the determination of 11 target PFASs in Antarctic seabird plasma samples. ΣPFASs in Antarctic seabird plasma ranged from 0.37 to 19 ng g−1, with a predominance of PFOS (>54% of ΣPFASs on average).

Fifty-three PFAS from 14 compound classes (including many contaminants of emerging concern) were measured using a single analytical method. After solid-phase extraction using weak anion exchange cartridges, method detection limits in water ranged from 0.28 to 18 ng/L and method quantitation limits ranged from 0.35 to 26 ng/L. Method accuracy ranged from 70 to 127% for 49 of the 53 extracted PFAS, with the remaining four between 66 and 138%. Method precision ranged from 2 to 28% RSD, with 49 out of the 53 PFAS being below < 20%. In addition to quantifying > 50 PFAS, many of which are currently unregulated in the environment and not included in typical analytical lists, this method has efficiency advantages over other similar methods as it utilizes a single chromatographic separation with a shorter runtime (14 min), while maintaining method accuracy and stability and the separation of branched and linear PFAS isomers. The method was applied to wastewater influent and effluent; surface water from a river, wetland, and lake; and drinking water samples to survey PFAS contamination in Australian aqueous matrices.

Sediment cores were collected at two sampling locations chosen in the most polluted zone of the Deûle River (Northern France) in proximity of a Zn, Pb, Cu, and Ni smelter called “Metaleurop” that had closed in 2003. Site I was chosen in the vicinity of the historic smelter site and site II upstream of the Deûle River. The incubation was realized directly in the sediment cores during the 24 hour experiment under environmental conditions close to the real natural systems (the same temperature, pH, humidity, light/dark conditions, oxygen levels…). The enriched isotopes were injected by needle into different sections of the core. After incubation, the core was sliced and the concentration of Hg species was determined in each section. The highest methylation potentials were found at sediment depths away from the sediment–water-interface.

In this study, we present the most recent 5-years of accumulated data and scrutinize the relationship between concentrations in water and biota highlighting bioaccumulation characteristics. Twelve individual PFAAs in samples of water (n = 43) and biota (n = 59) were quantified by use of HPLC-MS/MS after solid phase extraction. In recent years, concentrations of PFAAs in water have been generally decreasing, but profiles of relative concentrations of individual PFAAs vary among location and year. Bioaccumulation of PFAAs in various organisms including fishes, bivalves, crabs, gastropods, shrimps, starfish, and polychaetes varied among species. However; overall bioaccumulation of PFAAs was dependent on corresponding concentrations of PFAAs in water within an area. In organ-specific distributions of PFAAs, greater concentrations of PFAAs were found in intestine of fish (green eel goby). This result suggests that PFAAs are mainly accumulated via dietary exposure, while greater concentrations were found in gill and intestine of bivalve (oyster) which suggests both waterborne and dietary exposures to these organisms. Concentrations of PFAAs in biota did not decrease over time (2008-2010), indicating that continuing bioaccumulation followed by slow degradation or excretion of PFAAs accumulated in biota. Overall, spatio-temporal distributions of PFAAs in water and bioaccumulation characteristics seemed to be associated with recent restrictions of PFOS-based products and uses of PFBS-based substitutes.

They are widely employed in producing various goods used in daily life, such as non-stick cookware, cleaning agents, and many industrial applications in aerospace, automotive, construction, electronics, and military, all of which ultimately end up in different environmental matrices. India’s rapid economic growth necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its PFAS contamination levels and potential human and ecological exposure. Results: The present study reports the quantification of one long-chain and two short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids and three long-chain and two short-chain perfluorosulfonic acids and qualitative analysis using suspect screening in the waters of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Samples were collected from surface and groundwater sources, including the Adyar river, Buckingham canal, Chembarambakkam lake, and the water treatment plant. The concentrations analyzed in all the samples ranged from 0.10 ng/L to 136.27 ng/L. Groundwater had some of the highest concentrations of PFAS. L-PFBS (up to 136.27 ng/L) and PFOA (up to 77.61 ng/L) are present in all the samples. The concentrations of all the target PFAS increased in the 5 to 103% range in the final treated water compared to the raw water of the water treatment plant. This treated water is distributed as a source of drinking water for the residents of Chennai. Additionally, the dominance of short-chain compounds (4–7 carbons) over long-chain compounds (> 7 carbons) was observed. Suspect screening revealed numerous precursors and other fluorinated compounds abundantly present in the samples. Conclusions: Our study revealed PFAS levels up to 136.27 ng/L in both surface and groundwater samples from Chennai. These findings raise concerns about potential risks to ecosystems and human well-being. The dominance of short-chain PFAS coupled with abundant precursors and unidentified fluorinated compounds indicates an ongoing shift toward alternatives. Conventional water treatment is ineffective in eliminating these chemicals from the water system; rather, increasing the PFAS concentrations from raw water to treated water necessitates advanced polishing steps. Industrial emissions, untreated domestic wastewater discharge, and open dump sites have been suspected as the significant sources of contamination, highlighting the need for further investigation to fully assess the extent of PFAS contamination in Chennai.

We determined the accumulation and trophic transfer of 14 PFASs (5 short-chain and 9 long-chain) within the food web of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River of North Carolina and South Carolina, US. Food web components and pathways were determined by stable isotope analyses of producers, consumers, and organic matter. Analyses of water, sediment, organic matter, and aquatic biota revealed that PFASs were prevalent in all food web compartments. Biofilm, an aggregation of bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoans and a basal resource for the aquatic food web, showed high PFAS accumulation (in 10 of 14 compounds), particularly for perfluorooctanoic acid, with the greatest mean concentration of 463.73 ng/g. The food web compartment with the most detections and greatest concentrations of PFASs was aquatic insects; all 14 PFASs were detected in individual aquatic insect samples (range of <limit of detection [<LOD] to 1670.10 ng/g of wet weight [WW]). These findings may suggest a trophic link between biofilm PFASs and aquatic insect PFASs. Individual fish tissue samples ranged from <LOD to 797.00 ng/g of WW, where perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFAS among all samples (64%). The ova of an imperiled fish, the robust redhorse (Moxostoma robustum), had concentrations of 10 PFASs (range of <LOD to 482.88 ng/g of WW) and the highest PFOS concentration (482.88 ng/g of WW), indicating a likely maternal transfer. The trophic magnification factors (TMFs) calculated in this study showed that various taxa accumulated PFAS compounds differently. PFBS, a short-chain PFAS compound that would presumably exhibit lesser TMFs, had nine values among our compartments and organisms >1.0 (range of 0.57 to 2.33); it is possible that an unmeasured PFBS precursor may be accumulating in biota and metabolizing to PFBS, leading to a higher than expected TMFs for this compound. Our findings demonstrate the prevalence of PFASs in a freshwater food web with potential implications for ecological and human health.

These chemicals pose a threat to both aquatic wildlife and human health via the consumption of contaminated prey or the intake of contaminated food originating from the aquatic environment. EU member states will need to establish programs to monitor the concentration of 11 priority substances in biota and assess compliance against these new standards for the classification of surface water bodies. An EU-wide guidance effectively addresses the implementation of EQS(biota). Flexibility is allowed in the choice of target species used for monitoring to account for both diversity of habitats and aquatic community composition across Europe. According to that guidance, the consistency and comparability of monitoring data across member states should be enhanced by adjusting the data on biota contaminant concentrations to a standard trophic level by use of the appropriate trophic magnification factor (TMF), a metric of contaminant biomagnification through the food web. In this context, the selection of a TMF value for a given substance is a critical issue, because this field-derived measure of trophic magnification can show variability related to the characteristics of ecosystems, the biology and ecology of organisms, the experimental design, and the statistical methods used for TMF calculation. This paper provides general practical advice and guidance for the selection or determination of TMFs for reliable application within the context of the WFD (i.e., adjustment of monitoring data and EQS derivation). Based on a series of quality attributes for TMFs, a decision tree is presented to help end users select a reasonable and relevant TMF. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:266-277.

Indoor dust, total suspended particles (TSP), diet, and drinking water samples were also collected to trace the occupational exposure pathway to PFAA isomers. The geometric mean concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) isomers in the serum were 1386, 371, and 863 ng mL-1, respectively. The linear isomer of PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS was the most predominant PFAA in the serum, with mean proportions of 63.3, 91.1, and 92.7% respectively, which were higher than the proportions in urine. The most important exposure routes to PFAA isomers in the occupational workers were considered to be the intake of indoor dust and TSP. A renal clearance estimation indicated that branched PFAA isomers had a higher renal clearance rate than did the corresponding linear isomers. Molecular docking modeling implied that linear PFOS (n-PFOS) had a stronger interaction with human serum albumin (HSA) than branched isomers did, which could decrease the proportion of n-PFOS in the blood of humans via the transport of HSA. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.5b00778,Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Sulfonic Acids;China;Dust;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;controlled study;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;chemistry;molecular docking;perfluoro compound;diet;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;pollution exposure;spatiotemporal analysis;alkanesulfonic acid;surfactant;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;sulfonic acid derivative;human;serum;urine;occupational exposure;Occupational Exposure;blood sampling;drinking water;Potable water;suspended particulate matter;blood;toxicokinetics;Drinking Water;analysis;Caprylates;Diet;octanoic acid derivative;ambient air;body burden;industry;Industry;Isomers;isomer;dust;biochemical composition;concentration (parameters);Body fluids;urinalysis;normal human;Perfluorooctanoate;indoor air pollution;Isomerism;Plants (botany);manufacturing;Manufacturing plant;indoor air;Occupational exposure;work environment;Air Pollution;dust exposure;Indoor;plasma clearance;isomerism;human serum albumin;Human serum albumins;urinary excretion;manufacturing industry;kidney clearance;Drinking water samples;manpower;Total suspended particles,NA,NA

PFASs were ubiquitously detected in farmland soils, and the detection frequency of 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA) was higher than that of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (98% vs. 83%). Long-chain PFASs, including 6:2 Cl-PFESA, showed a centered distribution pattern around the metropolis of Tianjin, probably due to the local intensive industrial activity, while trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) showed a decreasing trend from the coast to the inland area. Other than soil, TFA was also found at higher levels than other longer-chain PFASs in dust, maize (Zea mays), poplar (Populus alba) leaf and locust (Locusta migratoria manilens) samples. Both poplar leaves and locusts can be used as promising biomonitoring targets for PFASs in farmland environments, and their accumulation potential corresponds with protein and lipid contents. Apart from being exposed to PFASs via food intake, locusts were likely exposed via uptake from soil and precipitated dust in farmland environments. The biomonitoring of locusts may be more relevant to insectivores, which is important to conducting a comprehensive ecological risk assessment of farmland environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114487,Biomonitoring;Biological Monitoring;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;China;Dust;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;biological monitoring;biomonitoring;environmental monitoring;chemistry;lipid;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;geographic distribution;Geographical distribution;risk assessment;Risk assessment;soil;article;Ecological risk assessment;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;Soil;soil pollution;Soils;plant leaf;Plant Leaves;Industrial activities;Beijing;Beijing [China];agricultural land;agricultural soil;Farms;geographical distribution;Plants (botany);Per-;Hebei;polyfluoroalkyl substances;leaf;Tianjin;Distribution patterns;Acrididae;Caelifera;Farmland environment;Grain (agricultural product);Grasshoppers;locust;Locust;Orthoptera,NA,NA

In this study, the acute toxicity and chronic toxicity to zebrafish (Danio rerio) induced by PFOS in the presence of ZnO-NPs were investigated, including developmental toxicity and DNA damage. The embryos were exposed to PFOS (only) (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mg/L) and PFOS plus ZnO-NPs (0.4+50, 0.8+50, and 1.6+50 mg/L) solutions to evaluate mortality (96 h), body length (96 h), hatch rate (72 h), heart rate (48 h),and malformation rate (96 h). The results revealed that the co-treatment could cause more severe developmental toxicity compared with the control and single-treatments, and the toxic effects generally increased in a dose-response manner. In addition, adult zebrafish were exposed to single and mixed solutions of PFOS and ZnO-NPs (at the concentrations mentioned above) for 30 days. DNA damage to zebrafish was evaluated by the comet assay and micronucleus test. We found that the PFOS single-treatment at all doses (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mg/L) could strongly induce DNA damage to peripheral blood cells and that ZnO-NPs could aggravate the formation of DNA damage in co-treatments. Histological examination of liver, testicle, and ovary showed that the presence of ZnO-NPs (50 mg/L) could also cause more serious histological damage to adult zebrafish than PFOS alone. As a result, the synergistic effects played an important role during joint exposure. Our observations provide a basic understanding of the joint toxicity of PFOS and ZnO-NPs to aquatic organisms. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,10.1002/tox.22050,"Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;DNA;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Liver;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;surfactant;genetics;chronic toxicity;sulfonate;Toxicity;embryo development;embryology;Embryonic Development;developmental toxicity;embryo;hatching;liver;liver toxicity;oxide;zinc;mortality;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;dose-response relationship;bioassay;priority journal;blood;toxicity test;animal cell;zebra fish;Zebrafish;DNA damage;nonmammalian embryo;acute toxicity;nanoparticle;histopathology;embryo mortality;embryotoxicity;Danio rerio;heart rate;histology;drug effects;aquatic species;congenital malformation;aquatic organism;Aquatic organisms;Embryo;testis;ovary;DNA Damage;Nonmammalian;metal nanoparticle;Metal Nanoparticles;blood cell;electrokinesis;comet assay;Metal nanoparticles;drug interaction;Drug Interactions;Blood Cells;Comet assay;Comet assays;DNA damages;Micronucleus;micronucleus test;zinc oxide;Zinc oxide;Zinc Oxide;zinc oxide nanoparticle;ZnO nanoparticles;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Sulfones;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form",NA,NA

The PFAS concentrations in males were statistically higher (p < 0.05) than those in females. Elevated glioma grades were associated with higher concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, and FOSA. Positive correlations were observed between PFAS concentrations (especially for PFOA) and Ki-67 or P53 expression, pathological molecular markers of glioma.

The main objective of the present work was to study the relative influence of temperature, food quality and food availability on the growth and contamination of juveniles of common sole (Solea solea), a marine flatfish species known to be a relevant indicator of the nursery quality. It focuses on two Persistent Organic Pollutants (CB153 and L-PFOS) of legacy and emerging concern, respectively. To achieve this, we used a toxicokinetic (TK) model in which toxicant flows are mechanistically predicted using a bioenergetic model based on the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. This modelling framework was applied to juvenile sole from the Gironde estuary (SW France) and allows accounting for the influence of environmental conditions on fish biological processes involved in toxicant fluxes. To compare their respective influence on model predictions of age, length, and contamination at puberty, we included in a global sensitivity analysis: (1) environmental variability gathered from literature for this particular estuary and (2) TK parameters (i.e. assimilation efficiency AE and elimination rate (k) over dot(e)) variability and uncertainty gathered from literature about each contaminant but for different fish species and experimental conditions. Then, model predictions were confronted to fish contamination measurements from the Gironde Estuary with different combinations of TK parameter values from literature. Results highlighted a key role of diet composition on fish contamination and growth while water temperature only affected growth. It stressed the need to focus on GC impact on benthic communities and their consequences on juvenile fish diet for future work on GC scenarios. Furthermore, for both chemical, the range of variability of TK parameters from experiments led to underestimated fish contaminations. The best model fits were obtained using TK parameter values from model applications: from Mounier et al. for CB153 (Solea solea, experiment, AE= 0.8 and =0 d(-1)) and from de Vos et al.

PFAA measurements were quantified in stripedmullet liver (n = 128), muscle (n = 49), and gonad (n = 10). No significant negative impacts of liver PFAA burden on wild-caught, mullet fecundity endpoints were observed in this study; however, changes in PFAA were observed in the liver as mullet progressed through different sub-stages of oocyte development. Of the PFAA with significant changes by sub-stage of oocyte development, the carboxylic acids (perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorotridecanoic acid) increased in the liver with increasing sub-stage while the sulfonic acid and its precursor (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanesulfonamide, respectively) decreased in the liver with increasing sub-stage of oocyte development.

These microbial assemblages, also called biofilms, are not only involved in nutrients fluxes but also in contaminants dynamics. Biofilms can accumulate metals and organic contaminants transported by the water flow and/or adsorbed onto substrates. Furthermore, due to their high metabolic activity and their role in aquatic food webs, microbial biofilms are also likely to influence contaminant fate in aquatic ecosystems. In this review, we provide (1) a critical overview of the analytical methods currently in use for detecting and quantifying metals and organic micropollutants in microbial biofilms attached to benthic substrata (rocks, sediments, leaf litter); (2) a review of the distribution of those contaminants within aquatic biofilms and the role of these benthic microbial communities in contaminant fate; (3) a set of future challenges concerning the role of biofilms in contaminant accumulation and trophic transfers in the aquatic food web. This literature review highlighted that most knowledge on the interaction between biofilm and contaminants is focused on contaminants dynamics in periphyton while technical limitations are still preventing a thorough estimation of contaminants accumulation in biofilms attached to leaf litter or sediments. In addition, microbial biofilms represent an important food resource in freshwater ecosystems, yet their role in dietary contaminant exposure has been neglected for a long time, and the importance of biofilms in trophic transfer of contaminants is still understudied.",NA,10.1007/398_2019_39,Bioaccumulation;Metals;Ecosystem;toxicity;Food Chain;Fresh Water;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Biofilms;Analytical methods;Organic micropollutants;0;Index Medicus;Microbial ecotoxicology;Periphyton,NA,NA

As top predators with a long lifespan, they are prone to exposure to various contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and contaminants of emerging concern. In this study, three pollutant families were investigated, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). Contamination was investigated in individuals from three tropical tuna species, namely bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tunas and the billfish swordfish (Xiphias gladius), collected from various areas of the western Indian Ocean (WIO) in 2013-2014. Contamination levels and profiles were examined in fish muscle, together with biological parameters (fish length / age, sex, lipid content) and ecological tracers (carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes). POP levels were low in all species in comparison to other locations worldwide, revealing a low impact of anthropogenic organic contaminants in the WIO. A predominance of OCPs (especially DDTs) versus PCBs was highlighted in all species; PFASs were predominant over chlorinated POPs in tunas. Among the studied PFASs, long-chain PFCAs were found to prevail over PFOS in all species. Organic contaminant profiles differed across species according to their foraging habitat; swordfish and bigeye tuna, which both feed in deep oceanic layers, showed similarities in their contaminant profiles. Geographically, the distinct DDT profiles of fish from the Mozambique Channel suggested an exposure to different DDT sources, in line with regional use of this insecticide and coupled with an extended residence time of fish in the Channel.

After being disregarded for the past 30 years, 6:2 Cl-PFAES has now been detected in environmental matrices and human sera, suggesting potential health concerns. We carried out a subchronic exposure study to investigate the reproductive toxicity of 6:2 Cl-PFAES exposure (0, 0.04, 0.2, and 1.0 mg/kg/d body weight, 56 d) in adult male BALB/c mice.

However, no changes were observed in the serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or luteinizing hormone (LH), nor in the histopathological structure of the epididymis and testis and sperm count. In addition, 56 d of consecutive gavage of 1.0 mg/kg/d of 6:2 Cl-PFAES did not affect male mouse fertility. RNA sequencing showed that no genes were significantly altered in the testes after 6:2 Cl-PFAES exposure.

Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the two perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) with 8 carbons in their structure, have been phased out on a global scale because of their high environmental persistence and toxicity. As a result, shorter-chain PFAAs with less than 8 carbons in their structure are being used as their replacements and are now widely detected in the environment, raising concerns about their effects on human health. In this study, 47 PFAAs and their precursors were measured in paired samples of dust and drinking water collected from residential homes in Indiana, United States, and in blood and urine samples collected from the residents of these homes. Ultrashort- (with 2 or 3 carbons [C2-C3]) and short-chain (with 4-7 carbons [C4-C7]) PFAAs were the most abundant in all four matrices and constituted on average 69-100% of the total PFAA concentrations.

The instrumental analysis employing an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry achieved low limits of quantification (0.025–0.25 ng/L). The validated method (recoveries 70–120% and repeatabilities ≤ 20% at tested concentrations (0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 ng/L)) was applied to 67 tap water and 31 bottled water samples collected in the Czech Republic. The most abundant compounds were perfluorononanoic acid (88% positives; 0.034–13.3 ng/L) and perfluoroheptanoic acid (23% positives; 0.035–0.106 ng/L), respectively. ∑PFAS in positive samples ranged from 0.029 to 300 ng/L (99% positives, median 2.34 ng/L) in tap water data and 0.033 to 4.48 ng/L (32% positives, median 0.097 ng/L) in bottled water samples.

During the first trimester, EVTs engraft and remodel maternal spiral arteries allowing for efficient blood flow and the transfer of essential nutrients and oxygen to the fetus. Aberrant migration of EVTs leading to either shallow or deep invasion into the uterus has been implicated in a number of gestational pathologies including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and placenta accreta spectrum. The migration and invasion of EVTs is well-coordinated to ensure proper placentation. However, recent data point to the ability of xenobiotics to disrupt EVT migration. These xenobiotics include heavy metals, endocrine disrupting chemicals, and organic contaminants and have often been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. In most instances, xenobiotics appear to reduce EVT migration; however, there are select examples of enhanced motility after chemical exposure. In this review, we provide an overview of the 1) current experimental approaches used to evaluate EVT migration and invasion in vitro, 2) ability of environmental chemicals and pharmaceuticals to enhance or retard EVT motility, and 3) signaling pathways responsible for altered EVT migration that are sensitive to disruption by xenobiotics.",NA,10.1016/j.reprotox.2021.11.008,Environment,NA,NA

Despite a mechanism to slow-down telomere shortening, cell division leads to progressive attrition of chromosomes, leading to the onset of cellular senescence or apoptosis. However, telomere restoration based on telomerase activity is the primary mechanism for telomere maintenance. Telomere length is associated to health and survival and can be impacted by a broad panel of environmental factors. However, the effect of contaminants on telomeres is poorly known for living organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate relationships between some poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), body condition and telomere length by using both a cross-sectional and longitudinal approach in adult breeding Black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) from Svalbard. First, we examined the associations between absolute telomere length and PFASs contamination in a given year (cross-sectional approach). Second, we investigated the relationships between telomere dynamics and PFASs contamination within a two years’ time frame (longitudinal approach). Our results did not show any significant relationships of PFASs and body condition with absolute telomere length in a given year. Surprisingly, we found a positive and significant relationship between PFASs and telomere dynamics in both sexes with elongated telomere in birds bearing the highest concentrations of PFASs. Our study underlines (i) the need to investigate PFAS effects on telomere dynamics with a longitudinal approach and (ii) a potential positive effect of these contaminants on telomere length, with the most contaminated birds showing the slowest rate of telomere shortening or even displaying elongated ones. Our study is the first to report a relationship between PFASs and telomere length in free-living vertebrates.

These anthropogenic particles were measured and physically classified into fibers, fragments, and films. Results of this study showed that 85% of S. lemuru were already contaminated with 3.74 +/- 3.92 # of microplastics even before being processed into various sardine products. These microplastics ranged from 0.12 to 21.30 mm and 80 % were mostly < 2.5 mm size classes. The dominant microplastics were 97.94 % in the form of fibers while 1.52 % and 0.54 % were respectively classified into fragments and films. Method validation by isolating microplastics from spiked samples (n = 30) with three retrieval attempts showed 100% recovery efficiency.

In this study, zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations of PFOA, HFPO-DA, and HFPO-TA (5 μg/L and 500 μg/L), and the toxic effects on oxidative damage, inflammation, and cell apoptosis in the gut were compared. Additionally, changes in gut metabolome profiles and microbial community structure were analyzed. The results revealed that exposures to HFPO-DA and HFPO-TA led to lower levels of oxidative damage compared to PFOA exposure. However, all three treatments had comparable effects on inflammation and apoptosis. The main biological pathways affected by all three exposures were lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and environmental information processing. The effects on metabolome profiles were much higher for HFPO-DA and HFPO-TA compared to PFOA at a concentration of 5 μg/L. At a concentration of 500 μg/L, HFPO-DA and HFPO-TA showed similar effects to PFOA. This study also examined the Pearson correlations between gut microbiota and the toxic effects mentioned above. The abundance of specific apoptosis-related genera differed among the three target chemicals, suggesting they may act differently in inducing apoptosis. The correlations between HFPO-DA and HFPO-TA were mostly similar, which helps explain the similar effects observed in their respective treatment groups on metabolic profiles. Overall, this study indicates that HFPO-DA and HFPO-TA may not be safe alternatives to PFOA and provides valuable insights into their toxic effects and risk assessment in water environments. © 2023",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106655,exposure;Animals;Article;animal;female;male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;comparative study;controlled study;animal tissue;lipid;lipid metabolism;water pollutant;perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);oxidative stress;risk assessment;toxicity;hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid;carboxylic acid;metabolism;zebra fish;organofluorine;haloacid;PFOA;amino acid;intestine flora;Zebrafish;aquatic environment;cyprinid;apoptosis;metabolomics;Metabolomics;concentration response;environmental parameters;Water Pollutants;inflammation;Chemical;amino acid metabolism;3;community structure;microbial community;Inflammation;3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoate;ammonium 2;hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid;HFPO-TA;nucleotide metabolism;environmental information processing;gastrointestinal toxicity;Gut microbiota;HFPO-DA;nucleotide,NA,NA

These molecules have been used since the 1950s as surfactants in many industrial applications and commonly used products. For two decades, some of these substances, perfluoroalkylated acids (PFAA), have generated a major concern due to their ubiquitous and persistent behavior in the environment. Currently, there is a real lack of knowledge about the full extent of environmental contamination by all PFASs. The overall objective of this thesis is to continue the efforts undertaken since the early 2000s to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of PFASs, from their sources in urban areas, their releases to aquatic systems, to their trophic transfer.The first part consisted in optimizing a configuration of the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) for the ultra-trace analysis of 25 PFASs in surface water. In a second time, the dynamics of the PFASs on the Bordeaux conurbation is studied. The analysis of 30 PFASs in wastewater collected in the sewerage network tends to show the importance of industrial inputs compared to domestic discharges for almost all the studied PFASs. Note that urban runoff is also a source of PFAS contamination. The characterization of the influents and effluents of the four main wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the metropolis shows a low efficiency of treatment channels. The use of a non-targeted analysis approach by oxidation, the TOP method (Total Oxidizable Precursors) reveals significant amounts of PFAA precursors in the sewerage network as well as in WWTP effluents. The impact of urban and airport storm water discharge on the contamination levels of a small peri-urban river has also been shown.

Further, PFAS interacted with Bd exposure to influence growth; Bd-exposed animals had significantly shorter SVL [snout-vent length (mm)] with significantly increased body condition, among other time-dependent effects. Our data suggest that larval exposure to PFAS can continue to impact growth in the juvenile stage after exposure has ended. Contrary to predictions, GenX affected terrestrial performance more consistently than its legacy congener, PFOA. Given the role of Bd in amphibian declines, further investigation of interactions of PFAS with Bd and other environmentally relevant pathogens is warranted. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.3c03191,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;exposure;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;survival;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;wildlife;pathogen;toxicity;Toxicity;Dimer acids;Hexafluoropropylene oxide;toxicity test;Fluorinated compound;juvenile;lake water;Wildlife;performance assessment;microbiology;body constitution;Anura;frog;water quality;fungus;larva;Larva;larval stage;Amphibia;'current;dimer;DNA extraction;amphibian;Amphibian;Batrachocytrium dendrobatidis;cycle threshold value;dissolved oxygen;Frog;fungal DNA;fungi;fungus growth;Hyla versicolor;infectious agent;metamorphism;metamorphosis;snout;wildlife management,NA,NA

The influence of these emulsions on fatty acid composition and metabolism was studied in 12 premature neonates, who were randomly assigned to an LCT emulsion (control) or an emulsion with a mixture of MCT and LCT (1: 1). On study day 7, all infants received [C-13] linoleic (LA) and [C-13] alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) tracers orally. Plasma phospholipid (PL) and triacylglycerol (TG) fatty acid composition and C-13 enrichments of plasma PL fatty acids were determined on day 8. After 8 days of lipid infusion, plasma TGs in the MCT/LCT group had higher contents of C8:0 (0.50 +/- 0.60% vs. 0.10 +/- 0.12%; means +/- SD) and C10:0 (0.66 +/- 0.51% vs. 0.15 +/- 0.17%) than controls. LA content of plasma PLs was slightly lower in the MCT/LCT group (16.47 +/- 1.16% vs. 18.57 +/- 2.09%), whereas long- chain polyunsaturated derivatives (LC-PUFAs) of LA and ALA tended to be higher. The tracer distributions between precursors and products (LC-PUFAs) were not significantly different between groups.

Levels of total perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in samples ranged from 136-15,300 and 30.5-2,720 ng/g dw for dolphin and porpoise, respectively. Significant increasing trends of several individual PFCAs and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) were found in cetacean samples from 2002 to 2014, whereas no significant temporal trends of Sigma PFASs appeared over the sampling period. This pattern may be attributed to the increasing usage of PFCAs and C4-based PFSAs following the restriction/voluntary withdrawal of the production and use of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) related products. In addition, significantly increasing temporal shifting trends of PFOS to PFBS were observed in the dolphin liver samples. This pattern may be attributed to the substitution of PFOS by its alternative, PFBS. The highest levels of PFOS were observed in the liver samples of dolphin as compared with other marine mammal studies published since 2006, indicating high contamination of PFAS in the South China region.

Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, expos re effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA’s maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution. ; San Diego State University",NA,NA,California,NA,NA

Recently, the possible adverse effects of PFOS on human health have raised concern. In this study, we examined the effects of PFOS on the expression of three important receptors related to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, six inflammatory-related genes, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of cell adhesion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results demonstrated that the expression of PPARγ and ERα were up-regulated after exposure to PFOS. After a high dose exposure (100. mg/L) for 48. h, the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, NOS3, ICAM-1 and P-Selectin were all notably up-regulated, whereas all of them did not show any significant changes after a low dose exposure (50. mg/L) for 24. h. Moreover, the expression of IL-1β, COX-2 and NOS3 were significantly up-regulated, when cells were exposed to 100. mg/L PFOS for 24. h. Meanwhile, the amount of ROS induced by the exposure to high-dose PFOS was significantly increased with increasing incubation times. Furthermore, the adhesion of THP-1 cells onto HUVECs was significantly increased after exposure to 100. mg/L PFOS for 48. h, as observed for the expression of ICAM-1 and P-Selectin.

The objectives of the present study were to investigate accumulation of PFASs in feathers of Eagle-Owls, spatial and temporal trends of PFAS accumulation, and if PFAS exposure could be associated with the owls trophic position (15N) and feeding habits (13C). No significant differences in PFAS levels were detected between sexes or sampling years. The highest concentration of sumPFASs was 98.6 ng/g dw from a feather from Frøya, coastal Central Norway (2013), while the lowest was 4.0 ng/g from Lurøy, Northern Norway (2015). The median level of sumPFAS detected in feathers from Southern Norway (41.59 ng/g dry weight (dw)), were more than twice as highs as in the feathers from the other areas (Coastal Central Norway: 21.37 ng/g dw; inland Central Norway: 10.77 ng/g dw; Northern Norway: 17.48 ng/g dw ).

We report a label-free differential scanning fluorimetry approach to determine PFAS–BSA binding over a broad temperature range. This method utilizes the tryptophan residue within the protein binding pocket as an intrinsic fluorophore, eliminating the need for fluorophore labels that may influence binding. BSA association constants were determined by (a) an equilibrium-based model at the melting temperature of BSA and (b) the Hill adsorption model to account for temperature dependent binding and binding cooperativity.

Inorganic nanoparticles which are generally metallic, silica-based, carbon-based, or polymeric in nature serve to remediate through chemical reactions, filtration, or adsorption. Their greater surface area per unit mass and high reactivity enable them to treat groundwater, wastewater, oilfields, and toxic industrial contaminants. Despite the growing interest in nanotechnological solutions for bioremediation, the environmental and human hazard associated with their use is raising concerns globally. Nanoremediation techniques when compared to conventional remediation solutions show increased effectivity in terms of cost and time; however, the main challenge is the ability of ENMs to remove contaminants from different environmental mediums by safeguarding the ecosystem. ENMs improving the accretion of the pollutant and increasing their bioavailability should be rectified along with the vigilant management of their transfer to the upper levels of the food chain which subsequently causes biomagnification. The ecosystem-centered approach will help monitor the ecotoxicological impacts of nanoremediation considering the safety, sustainability, and proper disposal of ENMs. The environment and human health risk assessment of each novel engineered nanomaterial along with the regulation of life cycle assessment (LCA) tools of ENMs for nanoremediation can help investigate the possible environmental hazard.

In this study, we performed a microbiological and molecular investigation of priority pathogens carrying transferable resistance genes to critical antimicrobials in 1-day-old chickens imported from Brazil to Uruguay. Bacterial identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Sensititre. Antimicrobial resistance genes were sought by PCR, and clonality was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Four multidrug-resistant (MDR) representative strains were sequenced by an Illumina and/or Oxford Nanopore Technologies device. Twenty-eight MDR isolates were identified as Escherichia coli (n = 14), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 11), or Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3). While resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins was due to bla(CTX-M-2), bla(CTX-M-8), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-55), and bla(CMY-2), plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance was associated with the qnrB19, qnrE1, and qnrB2 genes. Finally, resistance to aminoglycosides and fosfomycin was due to the presence of 16S rRNA methyltransferase rmtG and fosA-type genes, respectively. Short- and long-read genome sequencing of E. cloacae strain ODC_Eclo3 revealed the presence of IncQ/rmtG (pUR-EC3.1; 7,400 bp), IncHI2A/mcr-9.1/bla(CTX-M-2) (pUR-EC3.2, ST16 [pMLST; 408,436 bp), and IncN2/qnrB19/aacC3/aph(3 ”)-Ib (pUR-EC3.3) resistance plasmids. Strikingly, the bla(CTX-M-2) gene was carried by a novel Tn1696-like composite transposon designated Tn7337.

In this work, we searched for microorganisms resistant to antibiotics considered critical for human health in intestinal microbiota of 1day-old baby chicks imported to Uruguay from Brazil. We describe genes for resistance to antibiotics whose use the WHO has indicated to ""watch"" or ""reserve"" (AWaRe classification), such as rmtG and mcr9.1, which confer resistance to all the aminoglycosides and colistin, respectively, among other genes, and their presence in new mobile genetic elements that favor its dissemination.

Therefore, the evaluation of the risks associated with pollutants in this group is of great importance. The aim of this review is to provide information on the occurrence of legacy and emerging contaminants in marine mammals that inhabit Argentine waters. Also, to identify knowledge gaps and suggest best practices for future research. Reports of legacy contaminants referring to organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls were found in five species of cetaceans and two of pinnipeds. With respect to emerging pollutants, the presence of plastics was only evaluated in three species. Reported data was from at least a decade ago. Therefore, it is necessary to update existing information and conduct continuous monitoring to assess temporary trends in pollutants. All the studies were carried out in the province of Buenos Aires and Northern Patagonia indicating a knowledge gap in the southern zone of the Argentine Sea. In addition, pollutants of global environmental concern that have not been studied in Argentina are discussed. Future studies should fill these gaps and a greater effort to understand the relationships between pollutants and their effects on marine mammals is suggested.

Inputs (from riverine discharge, atmospheric deposition, coastal wastewater discharges, and the North Sea) and outputs (to sediment burial, transformation of the chemical, and the North Sea), as well as the inventory in the Baltic Sea, were estimated from recently published monitoring data. Formation of the chemicals in the water column from precursors was not considered. River inflow and atmospheric deposition were the dominant inputs, while wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents made a minor contribution (<5%). A mass balance of the Oder River watershed was assembled to explore the sources of the perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in the river inflow. It indicated that WWTP effluents made only a moderate contribution to riverine discharge (21% for PFOA, 6% for PFOS), while atmospheric deposition to the watershed was 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than WWTP discharges. The input to the Baltic Sea exceeded the output for all four PFAAs, suggesting that inputs were higher during 2005-2010 than during the previous 20 years despite efforts to reduce emissions of PFAAs. One possible explanation is the retention and delayed release of PFAAs from atmospheric deposition in the soils and groundwater of the watershed. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/es400174y,Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Rivers;Baltic Sea;Environmental Monitoring;perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;environmental monitoring;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;sea water;article;Caproates;North Sea;sea pollution;sediment;river;Groundwater;Caprylates;haloacid;waste water;Wastewater treatment plants;waste water management;Atlantic Ocean;Effluents;atmospheric deposition;Meteorological problems;Orders of magnitude;Deposition;watershed;Water Pollutants;Atmospheric chemistry;chemical modification;Chemical;Atmospheric depositions;estimation method;water column;Watersheds;mass balance;river flow;discharge;Oceans;Seas;Landforms;Metadata;Riverine discharge;Coastal wastewaters;data acquisition;Delayed release;inflow;Oder River,NA,NA

Thick-billed murre samples were from 1975, 1993, and 2004, whereas northern fulmars were from 1975, 1987, 1993, and 2003. Between 8 and 10 individuals were analyzed per year. Analytes included C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>15</sub> perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) and their suspected precursors, the 8:2 &amp; 10:2 fluorotelomer saturated and unsaturated carboxylates (FTCAs, FTUCAs), C<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>8</sub> (perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFOS), C<sub>10</sub> sulfonates, and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA). Liver samples were homogenized, liquid-liquid extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether, cleaned-up using hexafluoropropanol, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Overall, concentrations in seabirds were lower than those in other marine animals that occupy similar or higher trophic positions. In contrast to most other wildlife samples, PFC profiles were dominated by the PFCAs which comprised 81% and 93% of total PFC profiles in the 2004 thick-billed murre and 2003 northern fulmar samples, respectively. As well, the PFCA profiles were mainly comprised of the C<sub>11</sub>-C<sub>15</sub> PFCAs, which appears to be unique among other wildlife species. PFC concentrations were found to increase significantly from 1975 to 2003/2004. Doubling times in thick-billed murres ranged from 2.3 yrs for perfluoropentadecanoate (PFPA) to 9.9 yrs for perfluorododecanoate (PFDoA), and from 2.5 yrs for PFPA to 11.7 yrs for perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) in northern fulmars. PFCA concentration increases in thick-billed murres were significant for both time periods (1975→1993, 1993→2004), but in northern fulmars appeared to remain steady after 1993. Differences in the temporal trends observed may be the result of differing migratory patterns of the seabirds.

Elevated concentrations of ς46PFASs were detected in serum (120 ng mL-1) and excrement (110 ng g-1dw) were strongly related indicating a potential noninvasive sampling methodology. Environmental concentrations of PFASs were consistent with a highly impacted ecosystem and notably high concentrations of perfluoro-4-ethylcyclohexanesulfonate (PFECHS, 67584-42-3; C8HF15SO3) were detected in water (27 ng L-1) and swan serum (16 ng mL-1). In the absence of credible putative alternative sources of PFECHS input to the lake, we propose that the use of high-performance motorsport vehicles is a likely source of contamination to this ecosystem. The BAF of perfluorocarboxylic acids increased with each additional CF2moiety from PFOA (15.7 L kg-1ww) to PFDoDA (3615 L kg-1ww).

Their ubiquitous distribution and harmful effects pose a threat to wildlife worldwide. To provide a comprehensive synopsis and show the gaps and gluts of existing research on PFAS exposure in wildlife, we created a systematic map and bibliographic analysis of the literature. We followed our protocol to conduct a systematic literature search on Scopus, Web of Science and five other databases. In two steps (title/abstract/keywords and full-text), we screened peer-reviewed empirical articles, preprints and theses in English that studied the concentration of at least one of 34 PFAS compounds in free-ranging wildlife or their parts/products. Following the protocol, we extracted data and performed a critical appraisal. We included 581 publications. From the first and only paper in 2001, there was a linear annual increase to 54 papers in 2021. While PFOS (97% of studies), PFOA (91%) and long-chain PFAS in general were the most measured, few studies investigated new-generation PFAS (e.g. GenX and ADONA). Across the studied 1042 species from 26 taxonomic classes, the most frequent were the common carp (Cyprinus carpio, 8%), polar bear (Ursus maritimus, 6%) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis, 5%). Most sampling took place in the United States (17%), Norway (13%), Canada (12%) and China (10%), which were also the main publishing countries. Polar regions attracted significant research interest from countries all around the globe. Aquatic habitats (marine: 31%, freshwater: 28%) of temperate zones were the most common locations for sample collection. We encourage researchers to work towards closing the following gaps: investigating new-generation PFAS, assessing PFAS in mid- and low-income countries and performing more long-term studies, especially on invertebrates. We note the recent rise in studies on the physiological consequences of PFAS exposure and encourage further work on this crucial topic. Furthermore, we recommend that the statement of potential and actual conflicts of interest, and the provision of raw data and analysis code should be made compulsory by all journals and routinely enforced. This practice will mitigate conflict of interest and ensure reproducibility. © 2024 The Authors.

The levels of the ∑PFAA and their precursors decreased from the estuaries to the bay, which implied that terrigenous input (pollutant in land flowed into sea) was the main pollution source of PFAA in the LZB. The PFAAs levels in surface water were ranked as the order of dry > normal > wet season. The distribution coefficients of PFAA showed that the long-chain PFAA were more prone to be adsorbed by sediment and SPM than short-chain PFAA. The increase of ∑PFAA concentrations was in the range of 0.32–36.7 ng·L−1 after the oxidation conversion of water samples. Precursors were the important source of the PFAA in the surface water.

As the control of conventional PFASs, fluoroalkylether substances (ether-PFASs) as alternatives are constantly emerging. Subsequently, the three representative ether-PFASs, chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid (F-53B), hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA), and 4,8-Dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoicacid (ADONA) are discovered and have received more attention in the environment and ecosystem. But their security is now also being challenged. This review systematically assesses their security from six dimensions including environmental occurrence in water, soil and atmosphere, as well as bioaccumulation and risk in plants, animals and humans. High substitution level is observed for F-53B, whether in environment or living things. Like PFOS or even more extreme, F-53B exhibits high biomagnification ability, transmission efficiency from maternal to infant, and various biological toxicity effects. HFPO-DA still has a relatively low substitution level for PFOA, but its use has emerged in Europe. Although it is less detected in human bodies and has a higher metabolic rate than PFOA, the strong migration ability of HFPO-DA in plants may pose dietary safety concerns for humans. Research on ADONA is limited, and currently, it is detected in Germany frequently while remaining at trace levels globally. Evidently, F-53B has shown increasing risk both in occurrence and toxicity compared to PFOS, and HFPO-DA is relatively safe based on available data.

TMFs may be used for the risk assessment of chemicals, although TMFs for single compounds can vary considerably between studies despite thorough guidance available in the literature to eliminate potential sources of error. The practical realization of a TMF investigation is quite complex and often only a few chemicals can be investigated due to low sample masses. This study evaluated whether a pragmatic approach involving the large-scale cryogenic sample preparation practices of the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB) is feasible. This approach could provide sufficient sample masses for a reduced set of samples allowing screenings for a broad spectrum of substances and by that enabling a systematic comparison of derived TMFs. Furthermore, it was assessed whether plausible TMFs can be derived with the 'Food web on ice' approach via a comparison with literature TMF values. Results This investigation at Lake Templin near Potsdam is the first TMF study for a German freshwater ecosystem and aimed to derive TMFs that are appropriate for regulatory purposes. A set of 15 composite biota samples was obtained and analyzed for an extended set of benchmark chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants, mercury and perfluoroalkyl substances. TMFs were calculated for all substances that were present in > 80% of the biota samples. For example, in the case of polychlorinated biphenyls, TMFs from 1.7 to 2.5 were determined and comparisons to literature TMFs determined in other freshwater ecosystems showed similarities. We showed that 32 out of 35 compounds analyzed had TMFs significantly above 1. In the remaining three cases, the correlations were not statistically significant. Conclusions The derived food web samples allow for an on-demand analysis and are ready-to-use for additional investigations. Since substances with non-lipophilic accumulation properties were also included in the list of analyzed substances, we conclude that the 'Food web on ice' provides samples which could be used to characterize the trophic magnification potential of substances with unknown bioaccumulation properties in the future which in return could be compared directly to the benchmarking patterns provided here.",NA,10.1186/s12302-021-00530-x,Food,NA,NA

Possible mechanisms for the recent PCB increases include a vertical flux step driven by seabird-delivered nutrients and/or delayed loading of PCBs from the catchment into the ponds. The high PCB levels recorded in the seabird-affected sites suggest that seabird colonies are exposing coastal ecosystems to elevated levels of contaminants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we present the primary structures, phylogeny, and tissue-specific distributions of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) gmPpara1, gmPpara2, gmPparb, and gmPparg, and demonstrate that the carboxylic acids PFHxA, PFOA, PFNA, as well as the sulfonic acid PFHxS, activate gmPpara1 in vitro, which was also supported by in silico analyses. Intriguingly, a binary mixture of PFOA and the non-activating PFOS produced a higher activation of gmPpara1 compared to PFOA alone, suggesting that PFOS has a potentiating effect on receptor activation. Supporting the experimental data, docking and molecular dynamics simulations of single and double-ligand complexes led to the identification of a putative allosteric binding site, which upon binding of PFOS stabilizes an active conformation of gmPpara1. Notably, binary exposures of gmPpara1, gmPpara2, and gmPparb to model-agonists and PFAAs produced similar potentiating effects. This study provides novel mechanistic insights into how PFAAs may modulate the Ppar signaling pathway by either binding the canonical ligand-binding pocket or by interacting with an allosteric binding site. Thus, individual PFAAs, or mixtures, could potentially modulate the Ppar-signaling pathway in Atlantic cod by interfering with at least one gmPpar subtype. © 2022 The Author(s)",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107203,PFAS;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;PFAAs;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;Binary mixtures;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;alkyl group;animal tissue;Binding energy;in vitro study;molecular docking;fish;organohalogen;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;toxicity;Cytology;Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor;carboxylic acid derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;amino acid sequence;animal cell;computer model;molecular dynamics;signal transduction;perfluoroalkyl acid derivative;PFOA;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma;phylogeny;Chemical activation;PFNA;conformation;PFHxS;ligand;ligand binding;Ligands;binding site;sex hormone;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor;Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Atlantic cod;Gadus morhua;Co-exposure;Molecular dynamics;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta;Binding sites;Complexation;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha1;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha2;Potentiation;Ppars,NA,NA

Birds have been utilized as biomonitoring species due to their environmental pollutant vulnerability and wide distribution. The Oriental Magpie (Pica serica) is a representative residential species inhabiting terrestrial environments. In this study, we measured PFAS concentrations in Magpie liver tissue (n = 253) collected from 12 Korean regions in 2004 and 2017. The predominant compounds were perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS; mean: 23.8 ng/g wet weight), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA; 2.79 ng/g), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA: 2.11 ng/g). We observed significant correlations between Magpie PFAS measurements, indicating similar sources and bioaccumulation processes. Adult females showed significantly lower PFOS concentrations than adult males and young males and females, indicating that avian sex is a crucial physiological factor of PFAS accumulation. PFOS, perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeDA) concentrations in urban regions were significantly higher than rural regions. PFOS concentrations in Magpie livers increased significantly between sampling years, whereas C11–C13 carboxylic acids (PFCAs) decreased. This suggests that urbanization and population are major factors in Magpie PFAS accumulation. Almost all hepatic PFOS concentrations were below the threshold values proposed by previous studies, implying limited risks. Our findings suggest that the Oriental Magpies are PFAS sentinel in residential environments.

We conducted semi-field tests simulating natural conditions to determine the leaching and runoff capacity of emerging organic contaminants following fortification and application of municipal biosolids. We demonstrate the transfer of pollutants from biosolid-amended soil to leachate and runoff water generated by natural rainfall. Abstract Anthropogenic perfluoroalkyl substances, PFASs, and halogenated flame retardants, HFRs, have been detected in different environmental compartments. In order to determine the fate of these compounds in the soil-water system, a semi-field simulated runoff experiment was conducted following the application of municipal organic waste. Therefore, the application of four biosolids was carried out. The biosolids were fortified with perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; ∼1 mg PFOS per kg biosolid), decabromodiphenyl ether (c-decaBDE; ∼10 mg kg -1) and Dechlorane Plus (DP; ∼0.26 mg kg -1) commercial mixtures and were applied to soil packed in 15 runoff-leaching trays (2.5 × 2 × 0.05 m). These trays were designed to collect the leachate and runoff water generated by natural rainfall. PFASs and HFRs were detected in leachate and runoff water from several rainfall events from November 2011 to May 2012 (a first rainfall event of 10.5 × 10 -3 m, a second event of 16.0 × 10 -3 m and a third pool event with a cumulative amount of 113.1 × 10 -3 m) occurring after the initial biosolid application. The total mass distribution calculated in water samples showed a higher content in runoff samples (PFOS, 91 ± 2 %; BDE-209, 76 ± 17 %; DP, 83 ± 14 %). The order of the loamy sand soil affinity for PFOS, BDE-209 and DP was as follows: PFOS < BDE-209 ≤ DP, which was predicted, either from the compounds' water solubility, the octanol-water partition coefficient (K ow) or the organic carbon-water partition coefficient (K oc). The calculated leaching potential (L p) index or the Groundwater Ubiquity Score (GUS), which are based on these K oc s, revealed the reverse order of potential transport to surface and groundwater respectively. © CSIRO.",NA,10.1071/EN18032,fluorocarbon;organic pollutant;ether;leaching;organic sulfur compound;environmental risk;polybrominated diphenyl ethers;pollutant transport;biosolid;leachate;runoff;perfluoroalkyl substances;soil amendment;halocarbon;emerging organic pollutants;Ethers;Ether,NA,NA

It is believed that use of both BFRs and PFCs has resulted in lives saved by reducing flammability of materials commonly used and also due to their bactericidal (biocidal) properties. These compounds are also believed to contribute greatly to improving people's quality of life because they are indispensable in the manufacturing of a variety of industrial and consumer products. However, widespread use of these chemicals has led to environmental contamination on a global scale. These chemicals are also referred to as persistent organic pollutants because their unique properties, such as hydrophobicity and lipophilicity, lead to their accumulation in biological tissues. In addition, low biodegradability and volatility has led to their long-range transportation via atmospheric and ocean currents, resulting in widespread environmental contamination of animals and humans at sites remote from where these chemicals are produced and used. Exposure to BFRs and/or PFCs may result in serious health effects, including endocrine disruption, reproductive and immune dysfunction, birth defects, developmental neurotoxicity, and certain types of cancers. Exposure to BFRs and PFCs in farm animals is of great concern because these compounds can affect their health as well as serve as a source for human exposure via consumption of contaminated meat and/or dairy products. This chapter discusses BFRs and PFCs and their physicochemical properties, exposure, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and effects, with emphasis on domestic and pet animals. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, research examining the influence of PFAS on wildlife is warranted. Amphibians are sensitive to contaminants such as PFAS because of their porous skin and associations with aquatic habitats where contaminants accumulate. Because PFAS tend to bioaccumulate and can adversely affect the endocrine system, there is a need to examine uptake rates to inform ecotoxicology studies, as well as a need to examine sublethal effects. To address these knowledge gaps I conducted two experiments. First, I exposed larval northern leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens ), American toads ( Anaxyrus americanus ), and eastern tiger salamanders ( Ambystoma tigrinum ) to PFAS chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of 10 or 1000 ppb for 10 days and sampled them every 48 hours during the exposure period. In the next experiment, I examined the effects of PFAS exposure via contaminated substrate on the survival and growth of post metamorphic amphibians of the same species. I found that, for all species, body burdens often reached steady state within 48 to 96 h of exposure. Steady-state body burdens of PFOA ranged from 3,819–16,481 ng/g dry weight among treatments and species (corresponding BCFs of 0.5 to 2.5), while PFOS body burdens ranged from 6,955–489,958 ng/g dry weight (corresponding BCFs of 47–259) among treatments and species. These data suggest that steady state is rapidly reached in larval amphibians exposed to PFAS, particularly regarding PFOS. This reflects a high potential for trophic transfer of PFAS within food webs because amphibians are often low in trophic position and are important prey for many aquatic and terrestrial species. In post-metamorphic amphibians, there was no influence of PFAS on survival or mass. However, significant effects on snout-vent length were observed in all species, and body ...",NA,NA,"Ecology;Messenger;RNA;Poly A-U;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Polyglactin 910;thyroid hormone;ecotoxicology;body burden;perfluoroalkyl substances;bioaccumulation factor;Carbon-fluorine bonds;Ecology not elsewhere classified;endicrine disruptors;polyfuoroalkyl substances;stress response;substrate;uptake rate;RNA, Messenger",NA,NA

In addition to accumulation of a wide range of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners in both plasma and feathers, all non-PBDE BFRs and PFRs could be measured in feathers, while in plasma only two of six PFRs, i.e. tris-(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and tris-(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate (TDCPP) were detected. PER concentrations in feathers (0.95-3000 ng g(-1),) were much higher than selected organochlorines (005), such as polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (CB 153; 2.3-15 ng g(-1)) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE; 2.3-21 ng g(-1)), PBDEs (0.03-23 ng g(-1)) and non-PBDE BFRs (0.03-1.5 ng g(-1)). Non-significant associations of PFR concentrations in feathers with those in plasma (P >= 0.74), and their similarity to reported atmospheric (PFR concentrations, may suggest atmospheric PFR deposition on feathers. Most OCs and PBDEs, as well as tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(phenyl) phosphate (TPHP) and tri-(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) were associated to delta N-15 and/or delta C-13 (all P <= 0.02). Besides delta N-15 enrichment, delta S-34 was depleted in nestlings from fjords, inherently close to an urbanised centre. As such, both may have been a spatial proxy for anthropogenic disturbance, possible confounding their use as dietary proxy. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

PFOS was the dominant compound found in water at most of the sites surveyed and its concentration varied between <0.5 and 150 ng/L and next was PFHxS with <0.25 to 110 ng/L, while at much smaller concentration of <0.5 to 18 ng/L occurred PFOA.

However, PFAAs dynamics in the environment and the factors that determine wildlife exposure are still not well understood. In this study we examined PFAAs exposure in chicks of a generalist seabird species, the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), breeding 49 km away of a PFAAs hotspot (a fluorochemical plant in Antwerp, Belgium). In order to study the pathways of PFAAs exposure, we measured how chicks' PFAAs burden varied with age, sex, and body condition. In addition, we related PFAA concentrations to chicks' diet using stable isotope signatures. For this purpose, we studied plasma PFAA concentrations in 1-week and 4-week-old gull chicks. Only 4 (PFOS, PFOA, PFDA and PFNA) out of the 13 target PFAA compounds were detected. Measured concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were generally high compared to other seabird species but were highly variable between individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that maternal transfer plays a significant role in determining chicks' PFAAs burden, and that there are variable sources of exposure for PFOS and PFOA during post-hatching development. The association between PFOS and specific stable isotopes (i.e. delta N-15 and delta C-13) suggests a higher exposure to PFOS in birds with a predominantly marine diet. We also found that males' condition was positively associated with PFOS plasmatic concentration, probably due to the indirect effect of being fed a high quality (marine) diet which appears PFOS rich. Yet, exact exposure source(s) for PFOA remain(s) unclear. Given that PFOS concentrations measured in some chicks surpassed the toxicity reference value calculated for top avian predators, continued monitoring of exposure and health of this gull population, and other wildlife populations inhabiting the area, is highly recommended.

Linear PFOS (n-perfluoro-1-octanesulfonate (L-PFOS)) consistently dominated the isomer pattern in all eggs, comprising between 95.0% and 98.3% of the Sigma PFOS concentration. L-PFOS was highly enriched in the gull eggs as the Sigma branched-PFOS to L-PFOS isomer concentration ratios were very constant (overall average 0.038 +/- 0.001) and much lower compared to technical PFOS (range 0.27-0.54). The highest proportions of L-PFOS were generally observed in the eggs from the lower lakes (Erie and Ontario) colonies. All six mono(trifluoromethyl) branched isomers, or perfluoro-n-methyl-heptanesulfonates where n describes the carbon of the hydrocarbon chain were there is trifluoromethyl substitution relative to the sulfonate terminal group, were detected in the eggs from all the colonies. For example, P1MHpS is perfluoro-1-methyl-heptanesulfonate. Comparable to technical PFOS (T-PFOS), the percentage of the mono(trifluoromethyl) isomer to Sigma PFOS concentration decreased as the branch substitution was located closer to the sulfonate group, that is, P6MHpS (0%-2.5%), P5MHpS (0.43%-1.18%), P4MHpS (0.25%-0.69%), and P3MHpS (0.32%-0.74%). Although at even lower fractional composition than the mono(trifluoromethyl) isomers, of the di(trifluoromethyl) isomers, detected in >60% of the individual eggs per site was P35DMHxS and P45DMHxS for Toronto Harbour (Lake Ontario), P35DMHxS for Chantry (Lake Huron) and Fighting Island (Detroit River), and P45DMHxS for Gull Island (Lake Michigan). Relative to T-PFOS, and independent of colonial location, the high and consistent enrichment of L-PFOS in gull eggs is likely a function of several processes including PFOS or precursor sources, and isomer-specific PFOS or precursor exposure, accumulation, biotransformation, retention and/or elimination. The results of this study suggests that the apparent dilution of the mono(fluoromethyl) isomers from environmental processes that occur prior to final accumulation in herring gull eggs, is independent of the mono(fluoromethyl) isomer structure.",NA,10.1021/es100474r,Ovum;Sulfones,NA,NA

The sample treatment for the determination of compounds involves steps of lyophilization, solvent extraction and clean-up of the extracts with dispersive sorbents. PFAS were then analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. During contaminant exposure, detectable levels of compounds were found in all samples collected. Mean concentrations of selected PFAS were higher in sediments than in water samples. This fact is explained by the strong adsorption of these compounds into sediments. Sediment-water distribution coefficients (log Kd) were in the range 0.11 (PFBuA) to 2.46 (PFOA). Beside this, PFAS accumulation was observed in Holothuria tubulosa organisms. The uptake of PFAS was very rapid, reaching the maximum between 22 and 38 days of assay. Bioaccumulation factors (mean log BAF: 1.16-4.39) and biota sediment accumulation factors (mean log BSAF: 1.37-2.89) indicated a high bioaccumulation potential for the target compounds. Both parameters increased with perfluoroalkyl chain length (R2 > 0.93; p < 0.05). In organ-specific distributions of PFAS, greater concentrations were found in intestine than in gonads. Also, male specimens showed higher concentration levels than female (student t-test: tcal = 2.788, ttab = 2.262; p < 0.05). These data provide a detailed accounting of PFAS fate and distribution in the marine environment highlighting accumulation at lower trophic levels, a potential source for contamination in higher organisms.

In this context, the present study aimed to assess potential associations among these compounds in three fish species from differentially contaminated areas in southeastern Brazil, and morphometric indices used to assess environmental exposure effects, Fulton's condition factor (FCF), the Hepatossomatic index (HSI) and the weight to length scaling coefficient (SC). Fish samples were collected from three differentially contaminated study areas in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Guanabara Bay (GB), the Paraíba do Sul River (PS) and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon (RFL). Silver scabbardfish (Lepidopus caudatus) and whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) were sampled from both the PS (N=5 scabbardfish and N=9 croaker) and GB (N=10 for both species), while mullet (Mugil liza) were sampled from GB (N=15) and RFL (N=10). Results indicate that some of the morphometric indices seem to be directly affected by PFAS contaminant trends. Significant differences (p<0.05) among FCF were observed for mullet and croaker, while significant HSI differences (p<0.05) were observed only for croaker. The SC for each fish population varied among sampling site and fish population and did not seem to follow a fixed trend, corroborating previous assessments. A discriminant canonical analysis demonstrated higher discriminating contributions for the FCF and two PFAS, namely PFDA and PFOA. This variation is probably due to differential PFAS accumulation reflecting differences in trophic levels, although no direct associations between individual PFAS and the assessed morphometric indices were noted. PFAS, however, comprise several compounds, and each may be a different contributor to deleterious physiological effects. Further assessments are required, to better understand the potential deleterious effects of these compounds on populational fish health status. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.eti.2020.101198,PFAS;Fish;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Contamination;Contaminated water;Water pollution;Physiological effects;Environmental contamination;Fisheries;Health;Environmental exposure;Fish health;(HSI);Deleterious effects;Discriminant canonical analysis;Fulton's condition factor;Hepatossomatic index;Micropogonias furnieri;Southeastern Brazil;Weight to length scaling coefficient (SC);Body Water;Brazil,NA,NA

However, during the spring flood period, the inputs and outputs were within a factor of 2 for several PFAAs and the streamwater showed PFAA patterns resembling the patterns in rain (as opposed to snowmelt), suggesting that snowmelt water infiltrating the ground had displaced water from the previous summer. Comparison of PFAA mass balances between the two catchments further suggested that atmospheric inputs of short-chain (replacement) perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids had increased in the years before sampling, while inputs of the legacy perfluorooctane sulfonic acid had decreased.

The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Total Diet Study (TDS) collects foods that are both nationally and regionally distributed. In 2018, 172 processed foods were collected from grocery stores around Lenexa, KS, as part of the TDS national collection. A previously developed method for the analysis of PFAS in foods as part of the TDS regional collection was modified and optimized for these samples. This method was single lab validated using 5 different matrices and method detection limits were calculated. During the analysis of these samples, challenges arose with method blanks and further investigation into statistical methods to distinguish between blank and sample concentrations were done. The confirmation of two short chain PFAS, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), was not possible using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and a confirmation method was developed using high-resolution mass spectrometry. This technique was also used to investigate potential detections and interferents that fell within the retention time criteria for positive detections. In the national collection, positive detections of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were found in frozen fish sticks/patties, PFOS and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) in canned tuna, and PFOS in protein powder. Concentrations were all below 150 ppt, and no other detects were confirmed above the method detection limits in any other foods.

In this study, we assessed PFAS and PAEs exposure in American oysters collected in three study sites in Florida, USA. Potential physiological effects of these contaminants were assessed by collecting oyster biometric data, calculating condition indices, and assessing oxidative stress levels in these individuals. Finally, a human health risk assessment was conducted based on the concentrations found in the consumable Tampa Bay (TB) oysters. All PFAS and PAEs compounds assessed in this study were detected in at least one oyster in all study sites. Among all locations, ΣPFAS concentration range was 0.611–134.78 ng·g−1 and ΣPAEs <0.328–1021 ng·g−1. Despite the smaller size of Biscayne Bay (BB) oysters, they displayed the highest concentrations of most of the PFAS and PAEs compounds, which is likely associated with population size, and other sources in the area. Condition index (CI) III was smaller in BB oysters, likely indicating a stressed population. Even though BB oysters were the most affected individuals, Marco Island (MI) oysters displayed the highest levels of lipid peroxidation, which can also be associated with environmental factors and decreased food availability. Conversely, TB oysters exhibited the highest levels of hydrogen peroxide, likely indicating a better defense mechanism in TB oysters compared to MI oysters. The human health risk assessment for TB oysters indicated low risk from PFAS and PAEs exposure, but there is no reference dose for other compounds and the human diet is wider than only oysters. Therefore, the risk of contaminant exposure is likely higher.

Although multiple studies reported the pollution of the aquatic environment with these chemicals, only limited data is present on the environmental pollution of Tanzania's aquatic environment and the possible risks for human health through consumption of contaminated fish or invertebrates. In the present study, we examined the distribution of metals and POPs in fish, invertebrates, sediment and water, collected at two different years at multiple important water reservoirs for domestic and industrial purposes, in the aquatic environment near Morogoro, Tanzania. Furthermore, we assessed the possible risks for human health through consumption of contaminated fish and shrimp. Metal concentrations in the water, sediment, invertebrates and fish appeared to increase in sites downstream from Morogoro city, likely caused by the presence of the city as pollution source. Significant differences in accumulated concentrations of metals and POPs were observed between species, which was hypothesized to be caused by dietary differences. Concentrations of multiple metals exceeded water and sediment quality guidelines values. Only Cu (2.8–17 μg/L) and Zn (<LOQ – 151 μg/L) in water exceeded chronic and acute effect values. Furthermore, PFOS, PBDE and HCB concentrations exceeded biota quality standard values, suggesting an ecological risk caused by these metals and POPs in the aquatic environment around Morogoro. Our results suggest that potential health effects through consumption of contaminated shrimp, and to minor extent fish, are expected. The daily consumption of these proteins (0.016–0.027 kg/capita/day) in Tanzania is similar or higher than the tolerable maximum consumption of shrimp for Cu (<0.02 kg/capita/day), Co (<0.02 kg/capita/day) and PFOS (<0.01 kg/capita/day).

Knowledge of the electron ionization (EI) fragmentation behavior of individual HPAH isomers, achieved by injecting authentic standards in full-scan MS mode, was paramount in identifying a suite of HPAHs in samples from the AOSR. Confirmation of compounds in biological samples was based on the measured mass accuracy (±3 ppm) of 2 characteristic ions prominent in the EI mass spectra of each compound. Numerous compounds were detected in the high resolution total ion chromatogram in liver extracts of 4 biological species from the AOSR: river otter (Lontra Canadensis), northern pike (Esox lucius), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and snails (Gastropod sp.) many of which remain unidentified. Careful examination of the high-resolution accurate mass data suggests that dichloro-anthracene/phenanthrene, bromo-anthracene/phenanthrene and dibromo-fluorene were present in the biological samples. Lipid corrected concentrations of dichloro-PAHs were estimated to be 16.3 ± 11.4 (n = 4) and 5.5 (n = 1) ng/g in lake whitefish and river otter, respectively. Concentrations of mono-bromo-PAHs were an order of magnitude greater in snails (170.5 ng/g) than in northern pike (12.5 ng/g) while concentrations of dibromo-PAHs were 4 times greater in snails than in northern pike.

While many studies have shown that plants can accumulate some CECs, so far little effort has been made to explore mitigation strategies. This study tested the concept of alternating between TWW with conventional freshwater for irrigation to minimize CEC accumulation in plants. Tomato and lettuce seedlings were first cultivated in CEC-containing hydroponic solutions for 3 weeks, and then in CEC-free media for another 3 weeks. The plant tissues contained elevated concentrations of perfluorobutanesulfonate, perfluorobutanoic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid, carbamazepine, and fluoxetine ranging from 42.1 to 2724.2 ng/g (dry weight). However, after being transferred to CEC-free media, most CEC levels decreased by over 75%, attributed to plant metabolism, growth dilution and back release to culture media. This proof-of-concept study suggested that using TWW during the early part of the growing season may effectively minimize CEC accumulation. Such hybrid irrigation schemes have a great prospect for expanding the safe reuse of TWW and other lower-quality water sources in agriculture and should be further evaluated under field conditions.",NA,10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00058,character(0),NA,NA

The degradation of these precursors are regarded as a significant source of PFOS in the environment. In this study, the accumulation of N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid (N-EtFOSAA) in the plants of seven species, namely alfalfa, lettuce, maize, mung bean, radish, ryegrass, and soybean from biosolids-amended soil, and the degradation kinetics of N-EtFOSAA in soil-plant microcosms were evaluated over 60 days. N-EtFOSAA was found in the roots of all plant species, while was not in stems and leaves. The root concentration factors of N-EtFOSAA ranged 0.52–1.37 (pmol/groot)/(pmol/gsoil). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to elucidate the accumulation of N-EtFOSAA in the roots of plants. The results showed that the root protein and lipid contents explain 85.0% of the variation in root N-EtFOSAA levels (P < 0.05). Four degradation products, including N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (N-EtFOSA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetate (FOSAA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and PFOS were found in soils and plant roots, stems and leaves, indicating the degradation of N-EtFOSAA in soil-plant system. Degradation kinetics fitted a first-order kinetic model well. Degradation rate constants of N-EtFOSAA in the microcosms with plants ranged 0.063–0.165 d−1, which was 1.40–3.6 times higher than those without plants. Degradation rate constant of maize was relatively higher than those of other plant species.

Protein interactions are considered a significant driver of bioaccumulation and subsequent toxicity from re-exposure; however, most of the available literature is limited to legacy PFAS. We utilized microcalorimetric and spectroscopic methods to systematically investigate the binding between human serum albumin (HSA) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) of varying chain lengths and their nonfluorinated fatty acid (FA) counterparts. The results reveal the optimal chain length for significant PFCA-HSA binding and some fundamental interactions, i.e., the polar carboxylic head of PFCA is countered by ionizable amino acids such as arginine, and the fluorocarbon tails stabilized by hydrophobic residues like leucine and valine. Additionally, fluorine’s unique polarizability contributes to PFCA’s stronger binding affinities relative to the corresponding fatty acids. Based on these observations, we posit that PFCAs likely bind to HSA in a “cavity-filling” manner, provided they have an appropriate size and shape to accommodate the electrostatic interactions. The results reported herein widen the pool of structural information to explain PFAS bioaccumulation patterns and toxicity and support the development of more accurate computational modeling of protein-PFAS interactions.

Both tissues (muscle, liver, adipose and preen gland) and feathers (primary, tail and body feathers) showed elevated HBCD concentrations in Flanders, close to Europe's sole HBCD production plant in the Netherlands, and identified Normandy as a historical source region for PBDEs. In sharp contrast, the reactive BFR TBBPA bioaccumulated poorly (2.3%) in tissue samples, but was present in 96% of all body feather samples (0.36-7.07 ng g(-1), dw), equally in both regions. PBDE concentrations in tissues (7.46-903 ng g(-1) were considerably lower in the investigated Flemish Barn Owls, collected in 2008/2009, compared to specimens collected in 2003/2004 (46-11,000 ng g(-1) possibly suggesting the effectiveness of the 2004 European ban of Penta- and Octa-BDE mixtures. Feathers showed a similar trend and additionally exhibited HBCD concentrations (0.02-333 ng g(-1) surpassing those of PBDEs (0.50-10.4 ng g(-1) While body feathers were a reliable matrix to predict both internal PBDE (0.21 <= R-2 <= 0.67) and HBCD body burdens (0.20 <= R-2 <= 0.37), the suitability of primary and tail feathers appeared to be confounded by external contamination and moult. In conclusion, the present study clearly showed that the reactive versus additive use of BFRs results in contrasting exposure scenarios in a species higher up the food chain, and therefore may have profound implications for environmental health. In addition, the presented results extend the promising use of feathers as a non-destructive sampling strategy for current-use BFRs, and show that birds of prey are valid early-warning systems for environmental contamination.

However, the lack of commercial standards makes quantification of the PFOSA isomers in complex matrices a big challenge. For the first time, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method was established to identify and quantify PFOSA isomers. Improvement on chromatographic separation with selected reaction monitoring allowed full resolution of six monomethyl branched isomers of PFOSA. The isomers were identified and quantified using a series of characteristic fragment ions and the specific product ions of molecular anion m/z 498: m/z 78 (n-), m/z 169 (iso-), m/z 419 (1m-), m/z 164 (2m-), m/z 259 (3m-), m/z 269 (4m-) and m/z 219 (5m-PFOSA). With the aid of 19 F nuclear magnetic resonance to define one technical product as standard, the developed method was used to quantify PFOSA isomers in other technical products and spiked fish blood samples. The results indicated that the developed method displayed strong application prospect for measuring trace level of PFOSA isomers in complex samples.

Some of these PFASs may reach high concentrations in the upper trophic levels in the arctic food web due to bioaccumulation and biomagnification, and may disrupt physiological processes due to interference with endogenous compounds. In mammals, thyroid hormones are important for several biological processes, especially during the developmental stages, and studies have shown that PFASs may disrupt the thyroid hormone homeostasis. The hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) is a top predator in the arctic marine food web and is therefore susceptible to high exposure to PFASs, and the pups are suspected to be exposed both in utero and via the milk. The present study reports, for the first time, levels of PFASs in hooded seal mother-pup pairs. The aims of the study were to investigate levels and patterns of PFASs in plasma and milk, and to determine if the PFASs are subject to maternal transfer via milk and/or placenta. The study also investigated associations between concentrations of PFASs and levels of free and total thyroid hormones in plasma. PFOS was the most predominant PFAS, and the mean PFOS levels reported herein were 13.4, 30.4 and 1.24 ng/g w.w. for maternal plasma, pup plasma and maternal milk samples, respectively. Levels were within the range of levels reported in similar studies on pinnipeds. PFAS levels were generally higher in plasma than milk, supporting that binding to plasma proteins limits their incorporation into milk. There were higher levels of PFHxS, PFOS, PFDoA, PFUdA and PFTrDA in plasma of pups than mothers, while levels of PFNA and PFDA were higher in mothers than pups. The current study confirmed maternal transfer of PFASs from hooded seal mothers to pups and that this occurs via milk and probably also placenta.

The results showed that both high concentrations of PFOA and PFOS inhibited the growth of V. natans and triggered the increase in photosynthetic pigment content in leaves. The oxidative damage occurred mainly in leaves, but both leaves and roots gradually built up tolerance during the stress process without serious membrane damage. Both leaves and roots replied to short-term stress by activating superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), while peroxidase (POD) was involved under high concentration stress with increasing exposure time. Leaves showed a dose–effect relationship in integrated biomarker response (IBR) values under short-term exposure, and the sensitivity of roots and leaves to PFOS was higher than that of PFOA.

Hence, the exchange of SOCs between soil and air is of paramount importance to their environmental fate and potential risk to humans. In this paper, a method is developed to determine soil/air partition coefficients (K-SA) of SOCs. On the basis of the solid-phase fugacity meter developed for plants, the method was initially tested using a soil contaminated in the laboratory with chlorinated benzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A systematic validation exercise demonstrated that the method is not subject to a wide range of potential artifacts. It was then shown that K-SA in moist soil (relative humidity = 100%) is independent of the water content of the soil. The method was then extended to the measurement of K-SA in the original soil, which contained background levels of the SOCs. Good agreement was found between the K-SA values measured with the original soil and with the laboratory contaminated soil, confirming that the studies with contaminated soil can be extrapolated to environmental conditions and demonstrating that it is possible to directly measure K-SA at current background levels of soil contamination. The K-SA values of the compounds studied ranged over almost 4 orders of magnitude. There was an excellent linear relationship between K-SA and the quotient of the octanol/water and air/water partition coefficients (K-OW/K-AW), indicating that the Karickhoff model commonly applied to soil/water partitioning can be extended to the soil/air system. An equally good regression was obtained between K-SA and measured octanol/air partition coefficients (K-OA).",NA,10.1021/es9705699,character(0),NA,NA

We exposed chicken embryos via egg injection at a late developmental stage to GW7647, a potent PPARα agonist in mammals, and to PFOS or PFOA. Mortality was induced by PFOS and PFOA but not by GW7647. Transcripts of a number of genes activated by PPARα agonists in mammals were analyzed in liver and kidney of 18-day-old embryos. Several of the genes were induced in both liver and kidney following exposure to GW7647. Treatment with PFOA resulted in induction of acyl-coenzyme A oxidase mRNA in liver, whereas none of the genes were significantly induced by PFOS treatment. No up-regulation of gene transcription was found in kidney following treatment with PFOS or PFOA.

There is an urge to better understand their impacts on marine organisms and develop reliable tools for biomonitoring studies, while also assessing their potential impacts on human health. Given their position on top of food webs, sharks are particularly susceptible to bioaccumulation, making them potential sentinel species of marine contamination. The main objective of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for future marine pollution biomonitoring studies by correlating biochemical responses with tissue contaminant body burden in blue sharks (Prionace glauca), a species heavily caught and consumed by humans, while also addressing their general health. The chemical contaminants analysed comprised different persistent organic pollutants (POPS) families from polychlorinated compounds to brominaled flame retardants (BERN) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and different trace and heavy metals. Concentrations of some contaminants in sharks' tissues were found to be above the legally allowed limits for human consumption. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed and some strong associations were found between biochemical responses and contaminants' accumulation levels. DNA damage and lipid peroxidation levels, as well as the inhibition of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, were the main effects and consequences of contamination. The impact of contamination on these vital macromolecules underlines the suboptimal conditions of the sampled P. glauca, which can ultimately lead to the degradation of core ecological aspects, such as swimming, feeding, and reproduction. It can be concluded that P. glauca demonstrates great potential to be used as environmental sentinel and suitable biomarker candidates were identified in this work. Moreover, this study also highlights the risks that the consumption of blue shark derived products can pose to human health, which is of upmost interest as the sampled organisms were still juveniles and already presented values above regulatory limits.

The main objective of the present study was to assess uptake and elimination kinetics of PFPiAs in zebrafish (Danio rerio) following aqueous exposure. The results showed that PFPiA exposure can result in very high steady-state bioconentration factors (BCFss), compared to perfluorocarboxylates and perfluorosulfonates.C6/C10 PFPiA exhibited the highest BCFss, ranging between 107 and 1010, orders of magnitude higher than those for long-chain perfluorocarboxylates. Strong positive relationships were observed between BCFss versus the membrane-water distribution coefficient (Dmw) and the protein-water partition coefficient (Kpw) of the studied perfluoroalkyl substances. However, BCFss exhibited a substantial drop for the very hydrophobic PFPiAs (C8/C10 and C6/C12 PFPiAs). The reduced BCFss of these long-chain PFPiAs (perfluoroalkyl chain length = 18; Dmw = 109) is likely the result of reduced bioavailability due to interaction with solute molecules/organic matter present in the water phase and/or reduced gill membrane permeability. While PFPiAs can be metabolized to perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acids, the metabolic transformation rate seems insufficient to counteract the high degree of uptake across gill membranes. These findings help to better understand exposure pathways and bioaccumulation behavior of these important perfluorinated acids in aquatic systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.215,Biochemistry;Female;Fluorocarbons;exposure;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Bioaccumulation;Kinetics;animal;female;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;comparative study;controlled study;bioaccumulation;animal tissue;bioavailability;Biological Availability;hydrophobicity;organophosphate;perfluoro compound;protein;water pollutant;adult;organic matter;water;priority journal;metabolism;zebra fish;organofluorine;Zebrafish;cyprinid;Danio rerio;biological uptake;membrane;Chains;steady state;Aquatic organisms;kinetics;Organic acids;partition coefficient;phosphonic acid derivative;Water Pollutants;Enzyme kinetics;Chemical;phosphinic acid derivative;chemical interaction;gill;Bio-concentration factors;Water supply systems;Phosphinic acid;Phosphinic Acids;Water partition coefficients;membrane permeability;Metabolic transformations;Water distribution coefficients;Bioconcentration factors;elimination kinetics;metabolic transformation;Perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids;Perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acids;perfluoroalkylphosphinic acid;perfluorocarboxylate derivative;perfluorosulfonate derivative;Phosphonic acids;phosphorous acid;Phosphorous Acids;solute;Organophosphonates,NA,NA

In particular, recent attention on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has led to numerous explorations of different techniques for degrading the super-strong C-F bonds found in these fluorochemicals. In this study, we investigated the hydrodefluorination mechanism using silylium-carborane salts for the degradation of PFAS at the density functional theory (DFT) level. We find that the degradation process involves both a cationic silylium (Et3Si+) and a hydridic silylium (Et3SiH) to facilitate the defluorination and hydride-addition events. Additionally, the role of carborane ([HCB11H5F6]−) is to force unoccupied anti-bonding orbitals to be partially occupied, weakening the C-F bond. We also show that changing the substituents on carborane from fluorine to other halogens weakens the C-F bond even further, with iodic carborane ([HCB11H5I6]−) having the greatest weakening effect. Moreover, our calculations reveal why the C-F bonds are resistant to degradation, and how the silylium-carborane chemistry is able to chemically transform these bonds into C-H bonds. We believe that our results are further applicable to other halocarbons, and can be used to treat either our existing stocks of these chemicals or to treat concentrated solutions following filtration and capture. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA,10.1039/d2em00291d,Catalysis;Fluorocarbons;Article;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;carbon;halogen;perfluoro compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;prediction;perfluoroalkyl substance;hexachlorobenzene;iodine;Environmental contaminant;chlorine;halogenation;computer model;perfluorobutanoic acid;degradation;bromine;Hexachlorobenzene;fluorine;cation;silicon;Fluorine;covalent bond;Fluorochemicals;hydrogen;catalysis;anion;static electricity;Filtration;density functional theory;Density functional theory;Density-functional-theory;Chemical bonds;defluorination;Silicon;atom;electron;]+ catalyst;Atomistics;borane derivative;Boranes;boron;C-F bonds;carborane derivative;Carboranes;catalyst;Cationics;Degradation process;deprotonation;force;halocarbon;Halocarbons;heptafluorobutane;heptafluorobutanol;Hydrodefluorination;perfluorobutyraldehyde;reaction time;silylium,NA,NA

With increasing production and application of PFAAs in China, their distribution patterns have been widely reported, however with less attention to inland northwestern regions. Long-range transport and direct releases from local activities have been regarded as the main reasons for PFAAs distribution in such a remote area. To identify and quantify the contributions of different sources to PFAAs occurrences, an investigation was conducted in the Tianchi lake, nature reserve. A total of 20 water samples, 8 soil, 4 sediment and 10 fresh snow samples were collected and analyzed in 2015. The mean PFAAs concentrations were 3.38 ng L−1 in surface water, 1.06 ng g−1 dw in soil, 0.53 ng g−1 dw in sediment, and 3.31 ng L−1 in fresh snow, respectively. High levels of PFAAs were observed in surface water (15.41 ng L−1) from Western Tianchi pond and surface snow (14.24 ng L−1) from the site near a ski resort around Tianchi Lake indicating potential pollution by local human activities. The correlation between individual concentrations among water, soil and snow indicated the snow deposition as an important source. Although with limited sample size, principal component analysis associated with multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses have identified two major sources, which are characterized as tourism activities with dominance of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and long-range transport with abundant perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). Their contributions to total levels were 41% and 52%, respectively. These two sources contributed differently to the PFAAs presences in Tianchi and Western Tianchi Lakes. Source analysis indicates that the western Tianchi lake with a relatively small catchment was affected mainly by local activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.133851,Article;China;Snow;concentration (parameter);perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;perfluoro compound;chemical compound;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;Principal component analysis;spatial distribution;concentration (composition);water pollution;quantitative analysis;long range transport;water sampling;priority journal;Soils;Atmospheric movements;atmospheric transport;perfluorobutanoic acid;sediment;lake;Lakes;River pollution;correlational study;pollutant source;soil analysis;atmospheric deposition;Atmospheric transport;sample size;Deposition;PFBA;atmospheric pollution;snow cover;Catchments;butyric acid;surface water;human activities;pond;Linear regression;Factorization;Positive Matrix Factorization;snow;Recreational facilities;Multiple linear regressions;alpine environment;Alpine lake;Alpine lakes;Gansu;Increasing production;Lake Chaonaqiu;nature reserve;Snow deposition;Source analysis;tourism,NA,NA

Samples were analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), dissolved nutrients, stable nitrogen isotopes in particulate organic matter, and chlorophyll a (chl a). Sediment samples from 11 sites were analyzed for the concentration of the anthropogenic organic contaminant perfluorooctane sulfonate and its precursors (Sigma PFOS). While the data indicated impairment by nutrient, microbial, and organic contaminants at both agricultural and urban sites, the percentage of agricultural land cover was the most robust indicator of impairment, showing significant correlations (p < 0.05) to FIB, nutrient, chl a, and Sigma PFOS levels. FIB densities were strongly influenced by salinity and were highest at sites dominated by agriculture and urbanization. Nutrient levels and chl a correlated to both agricultural and urban land use metrics as well.

In the present study, PCB, MeSO2-PCB and HO-PCB concentrations and congener patterns were determined in the whole blood and adipose tissue of male (n = 7) and female (n = 12) polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of random age (3-25 years of age), and collected in 1999-2001 from the Ittoqqortoormiit/Scoresby Sound area in central East Greenland. There was no significant difference (P<0.05) between males and females with respect to PCB or PCB metabolite concentrations in either tissue. The mean sum (Sigma) PCB concentrations were 7020+/-3366 ng/g lipid weight (lw) (range 2708-18148 ng/g lw) and 46.1+/-44.6 ng/g wet weight (ww) (range 12.6-204.2 ng/g ww) in adipose and blood, respectively. The mean Sigma-HO-PCB concentration in whole blood was 182.3+/-72.1 ng/g ww (range 93.8-382.1 ng/g ww). The mean Sigma-HO-PCB to Sigma-PCB concentration ratios in whole blood were 4.59+/-3.58 (range 1.03-11.88) and 8.30+/-5.56 (range 2.16-19.47) in females and males, respectively, which are the highest ratios reported so far for polar bears from any population, or for any free-ranging animal. Sigma-HO-PCB concentrations were greater than all other major classes of organochlorines i.e. Sigma-PCBs, Sigma-MeSO2-PCBs, Sigma-chlordanes (CHLs), Sigma-hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and Sigma-chlorobenzenes (CBzs). The mean Sigma-MeSO2-PCB concentrations were 699+/-836 ng/g lw (range 127-3920 ng/g lw) and 10.9+/-9.6 ng/g ww (range 4.3-52.1 ng/g ww) in the adipose and blood, respectively. Regardless of age and sex, in both adipose and whole blood the MeSO2-PCB congener pattern was dominated by 3'- and 4'-MeSO2-CB101 and -CB87, and 4-MeSO2-CB149 (approx. 70% of the Sigma-MeSO2-PCBs). Minor differences in the MeSO2-PCB congener pattern were observed between blood and adipose, which suggests the possible influence of metabolite structure on mobilization and/or deposition to the adipose tissue. Sixteen HO-PCB congeners and one di-HO-PCB congener were identified, and five HO-PCB isomers and one di-HO-PCB isomer were detected. However, congener patterns were dominated by 4'-OH-CB120, 4-HO-CB146/3-HO-CB153, 4-OH-CB187, 4'-HO-CB172, 4-HO-CB193 and 4,4'-di-HO-CB202 (>10 ng/g ww). HO-PCB congener patterns in whole blood were not significantly different (P<0.05) between males and females. Other chlorinated phenolic contaminants, pentachlorophenol (0.3+/-0.3 ng/g ww) and 4-HO-heptachlorostyrene (7.5+/-2.9 ng/g ww) were also detected in blood. To our knowledge, this is to first report comparing PCBs, MeSO2-PCBs and HO-PCBs in whole blood and adipose tissue in a free-ranging wildlife species. HO-PCBs and MeSO2-PCBs are both important circulating contaminants in polar bears from this eastern Greenland population.

The concentrations of PFASs in roots of emergent plants were relatively higher than those in submerged plants. However, the translocation effect of PFASs was not remarkable. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of the aquatic plants indicated the absorption of PFASs were effective. BAFs in submerged plants basically increased with increasing chain length accordingly. In general, aquatic plants had the absorption preference for long-chain PFASs, especially PFOS, which was the predominant compounds in both submerged and emergent plants.

Besides many other countries, Germany takes regularly part at these evaluations. Within the European moss monitoring 2015, more than 400 moss samples across Germany were taken according to a harmonized methodology for the assessment heavy metal and nitrogen input. In a pilot programme, eight of these sites were chosen for additional investigations on a broad range of organic contaminants to evaluate their accumulation in moss and thereby their presence in atmospheric deposition in Germany. Target compound classes comprised polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and –furans (PCDD/F), dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCB, ndl-PCB), polyfluorinated alkyl substances, classical flame retardants as well as emerging chlorinated and brominated flame retardants. In total, 120 target compounds were analysed. For some analytes, comparisons of accumulation in moss and tree leave samples were possible. Results: Except for certain flame retardants, PFAS, and ndl-PCB, substances of all other compound classes could be quantified in moss samples of all sites. Concentrations were highest for PAH (40–268 ng g−1) followed by emerging flame retardants (0.5–7.7 ng g−1), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE; 0.3–3.7 ng g−1), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD; 0.3–1.2 ng g−1), dl-PCB (0.04–0.4 ng g−1) and PCDD/F (0.008–0.06 ng g−1). Conclusions: Results show the widespread atmospheric distribution and deposition of organic contaminants across Germany as well as the suitability of moss as bioaccumulation monitor for most of these compound classes.

However, few studies have addressed the potential effects of these contaminants in Canadian arctic wildlife. Prior to 1997, biological effects data were minimal and insufficient at any level of biological organization. The present review summarizes recent studies on biological effects related to contaminant exposure, and compares new tissue concentration data to threshold effects levels. Weak relationships between cadmium, mercury and selenium burdens and health biomarkers in common eider ducks (Somateria mollissima borealis) in Nunavut were found but it was concluded that metals were not influencing the health of these birds. Black guillemots (Cepphus grylle) examined near PCB-contaminated Saglek Bay, Labrador, had enlarged livers, elevated EROD and liver lipid levels and reduced retinol (vitamin A) and retinyl palmitate levels, which correlated to PCB levels in the birds. Circulating levels of thyroid hormones in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) were correlated to PCB and HO-PCB plasma concentrations, but the impact at the population level is unknown. High PCB and organochlorine pesticide concentrations were found to be strongly associated with impaired humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in polar bears, implying an increased infection risk that could impact the population. In beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), cytochromes P450 (phase I) and conjugating (phase II) enzymes have been extensively profiled (immunochemically and catalytically) in liver, demonstrating the importance of contaminants in relation to enzyme induction, metabolism and potential contaminant bioactivation and fate. Concentrations of OCs and metals in arctic terrestrial wildlife, fish and seabirds are generally below effects thresholds, with the possible exception of PCBs in burbot (Lota lota) in some Yukon lakes, Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), glaucous and great black-backed gulls (Larus hyperboreus and L. marinus), and TEQs of dioxin-like chemicals in seabird eggs. PCB and DDT concentrations in several arctic marine mammal species exceed effects thresholds, although evidence of stress in these populations is lacking. There is little evidence that contaminants are having widespread effects on the health of Canadian arctic organisms, with the possible exception of polar bears. However, further research and better understanding of organohalogen exposure in arctic biota is needed considering factors such as tissue levels that exceed effects thresholds, exposure to “new” organohalogen contaminants of concern, contaminated regions, and climate change.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2005.01.051,Vitamin A;Carnivora;Pollutants;Fat-soluble vitamins,NA,NA

Reliable equations for conversion between fillet and whole-body concentrations would allow for a single analysis of a fish to function for both human and ecological risk assessment. However, conversion equations do not exist for multiple species, and previous estimates are based on small sample sizes. Here, we assess relationships in 21 fish species and provide conversion equations for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA), four of the most common PFAS detected in fish from New York State. We analyzed 429 fish from 15 water bodies as separate fillet and remainder portions and then used the concentrations and weights of these portions to synthesize a whole-body fish concentration. Using linear models combining all species, the ratio of fillet to whole-body concentrations ranged from 1.77 to 1.91 across the four PFAS chemicals. Total PFAS conversion factors are 1.86 for fillet to whole-body and 0.52 for whole-body to fillet. These values showed consistency among PFAS chemicals, but values of models combining species were lower than those of species-specific models, suggesting the latter are ideal for risk assessment. © 2024 American Chemical Society",NA,10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00033,Biochemistry;Fish;PFOS;Ecology;bioaccumulation;Health risks;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Risk assessment;Ecological risk assessment;Perfluorodecanoic acid;Biota monitoring;Perfluoroundecanoic acid;Human health risk assessment;ecological risk assessment;biota monitoring;Conversion equation;human health risk assessment;Perfluorododecanoic acid;Perfluorooctanesulphonic acid;PFDA;PFDoA;PFUnA;Whole-body,NA,NA

Understanding the temporal trend of PFAS in the environment is important for their pollution control and making appropriate policies. Many studies have reported the PFAS concentrations in Taihu Lake, the third largest lake in China, while their temporal trend during the years was seldom investigated. This study summarizes the PFAS concentrations in the water, sediment and organisms in Taihu Lake from 2009 to 2020 to depict their temporal trends. Meanwhile, the ecological model of AQUATOX was applied to evaluate and predict the potential risks of PFAS from 2012 to 2030. The results showed that the total PFAS concentrations varied but without distinct increase or decrease in both water and sediment during the years, while PFAS concentrations in organisms significantly decreased. The yearly mean concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in the water were 21.7–25.4 ng/L and 9.7–26.5 ng/L respectively, lower than the Standards for Drinking Water Quality of China and the suggested water quality criteria to protect the aquatic organisms. In sediment, PFOA and PFOS concentrations were 0.16–0.69 ng/g and 0.15–0.82 ng/g respectively, much lower than the recommended sediment quality guideline values. Based on the AQUATOX prediction, there will be no major threats caused by PFAS to the growth of biota in Taihu Lake in the near future, while the biomass of some species (e.g. carp) will be affected under the perturbation of PFAS. Both field investigation and AQUATOX simulation showed that PFOS concentrations in invertebrates and fish descend steadily, while no remarkable decrease in PFOA concentrations was expected. This study suggests a decreasing ecological risk of PFAS in Taihu Lake, while highlights the necessity of continuous monitoring of PFAS contamination. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2024.118707,PFAS;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Temporal trends;China;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;environmental monitoring;pollutant;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;environmental management;prediction;tandem mass spectrometry;perfluorohexanoic acid;risk assessment;sulfonic acid derivative;biota;Environmental pollutants;ultra performance liquid chromatography;water;carboxylic acid derivative;drinking water;growth rate;Potable water;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;polyfluoroalkyl substance;water contamination;sediment;trend study;lake;Lakes;carp;Lake pollution;Forecasting;toxic substance;water pollution control;salmonine;Sediments;water supply;perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid;persistence;Water;environmental risk;Aquatic organisms;perfluorobutane sulfonic acid;Sediment;invertebrate;water quality;Water quality;pollution control;Quality control;organisms;biomass;catfish;simulation;Substance concentrations;per;phytoplankton;AQUATOX;bioaccumulation factor;bioconcentration factor;Organism;perch;Pollution control;Potential risks;sediment-water interface;Taihu Lake;Taihu lakes,NA,NA

To assess the feasibility and efficacy of using material derived from food waste to alleviate PFAS pollution, this study prepared activated hydrochar (AHC) for sorbing ten PFAS, including five perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA; C4–C8), three perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSA; C4, C6, C8), and two emerging PFAS, namely hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (commercial name GenX, an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS). The results demonstrated that AHC possessed a relatively high specific surface area (207 m2/g) and hydrophobic surface properties. At environmentally relevant concentrations (40 μg/L), the sorption partition coefficients (log Kd) of PFAS on AHC ranged from 2.33 to 6.49 L/kg. Notably, GenX exhibited a lower log Kd value (2.33 L/kg) than PFOA (3.88 L/kg). The AHC showed favorable sorption performance for all tested PFAS, with log Kd values surpassing other reported sorbents (e.g., 0.83 for GenX on pyrochar, and 2.83 for PFOA on commercial biochar). Additionally, desorption hysteresis was observed for all PFAS, except for PFOA, and was particularly pronounced in PFBA, GenX, and 6:2 FTS at high initial concentrations, with Hysteresis Index (HI) values varying from 0.31 to 1.45, 0.68 to 1.88, and 0.51 to 1.85, respectively. Given its robust sorption capacity and desorption hysteresis toward PFAS, AHC is expected to be a favorable candidate for remediating PFAS-contaminated water. This study underscores, for the first time, the potential of food waste-derived hydrochar as an efficient sorbent for alleviating PFAS contamination, and further study is needed to investigate the sorption and desorption behaviors of PFAS on AHC at various environmental conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122820,PFAS;Article;concentration (parameter);environmental chemical;unclassified drug;controlled study;environmental monitoring;hydrophobicity;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;environmental management;desorption;sulfonic acid derivative;ecosystem restoration;remediation;water contamination;Water pollution;Desorption;surface area;waste component removal;environmental factor;Hydrophobicity;GenX;chemical reaction kinetics;feasibility study;scoring system;Surface chemistry;Sulphonic acids;polyfluoroalkyl;Fluorotelomers;6:2 fluorotelomer sulphonic acid;6:2 FTS;biochar;Carbonization;charcoal;Desorption hysteresis;food waste;Food waste;Genx;Hydrothermal carbonization;hysteresis;Hysteresis;pollutant removal;Sorption/desorption;Food,NA,NA

We investigated the occurrence and distribution of 16 PFASs from 2 classes of PFASs - perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids - in the archived surface sediments of five major rivers (Yellow River, Hai River, Liao River, Zhujiang River, and Dongjiang River) in northern and southern China. The study was also performed during the wet and dry seasons. Perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid were the most frequently detected (detection frequency = 100 and 63 %, respectively) in the sediments of the five rivers; the concentrations ranged from 0.08 to 0.99 ng/g dry weight (dw) and were lower than the limit of detection (<LOD), which is 3.89 ng/g dw for both. Perfluorodecanoic acid and perfluoroundecanoic acid were moderately detected (detection frequency = 42 and 44 %, respectively) with concentrations ranging from less than their limit of detection (<LOD) to 0.69 ng/g dw and <LOD to 0.22 ng/g dw, whereas 12 other target analytes were lower than their limit of quantification at most of the sampling sites. Greater concentrations of the PFASs were found at those sites located in urban areas compared with rural areas. Sediment organic content was found to be an important factor influencing the distribution of PFASs in the riverine environment.

To this end, farmed juvenile cod were exposed at day 0 and day 7 via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections, in a two-week in vivo experiment. In total, there were 10 groups of fish (n = 21-22): two control groups, four separate exposure groups of PAH and PFAS mixtures (L, H), and four groups combining PAH and PFAS mixtures (L/L, H/L, L/H, H/H). Body burden analyses confirmed a dose-dependent accumulation of PFASs in cod liver and PAH metabolites in bile. The hepatosomatic index (HSI) was significantly reduced for three of the combined PAH/PFAS exposure groups (L-PAH/H-PFAS, H-PAH/L-PFAS, H-PAH/H-PFAS). Analysis of the hepatic proteome identified that pathways related to lipid degradation were significantly affected by PFAS exposure, including upregulation of enzymes in fatty acid degradation pathways, such as fatty acid β-oxidation. The increased abundances of enzymes in lipid catabolic pathways paralleled with decreasing levels of triacylglycerols (TGs) in the H-PFAS exposure group, suggest that PFAS increase lipid catabolism in Atlantic cod. Markers of oxidative stress, including catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities were also induced by PFAS exposure. Only minor and non-significant differences between exposure groups and control were found for cyp1a and acox1 gene expressions, vitellogenin concentrations in plasma, Cyp1a protein synthesis and DNA fragmentation. In summary, our combined proteomics and lipidomics analyses indicate that PFAS may disrupt lipid homeostasis in Atlantic cod. © 2020 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105590,PFAS;Fish;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Liver;Lipid Metabolism;Oxidative Stress;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;biological marker;biomarker;animal tissue;lipid;lipid metabolism;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;Biomarkers;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;oxidative stress;perfluoroalkyl substance;gene;gene expression;toxicity;drug effect;liver;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;priority journal;perfluorononanoic acid;metabolism;endocrine disruptor;analysis;catalase;glutathione transferase;metabolite;juvenile;body burden;enzyme;PAH;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons;fatty acid oxidation;lipidomics;Lipidomics;triacylglycerol;vitellogenin;Vitellogenins;homeostasis;Water Pollutants;Proteomics;cytochrome P450 1A;Chemical;lipid homeostasis;proteomics;Proteome;Atlantic cod;Gadus morhua;bile;proteome;acox1 gene;Bile;cyp1a gene;DNA fragmentation;lipolysis;mixture toxicity;peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA);polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH),NA,NA

This study determined the concentrations of eighteen PFASs in muscle and liver of nine wild freshwater fish species collected from rivers in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, South China, and assessed their bioaccumulation and potential health risks to local people. The results showed that eight and twelve PFASs were detected in the fish muscle and liver samples, respectively. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was found to be the predominant PFAS both in muscle and liver with its highest concentrations of 79 ng/g wet weight (ww) in muscle and 1500 ng/g ww in liver, followed by Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) and Perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) with trace concentrations. The mean PFOS concentrations in fish muscle and liver tissues of the nine collected species ranged from 0.40 ng/g in mud carp to 25 ng/g in snakehead, and from 5.6 ng/g in mud carp to 1100 ng/g in snakehead, respectively. Significant positive correlations were found among PFASs both in water and fish, indicating a similar pollution source for these PFASs. In tilapia samples, PFOS concentrations showed an increasing trend with increasing length and weight, but no significant difference between genders. Bioaccumulation factors (log BAF) in fish for the PFASs were in the range from 2.1 to 5.0. The calculated hazard ratios (HR) of PFOS for all fishes were in the range of 0.05-2.8, with four out of nine species (tilapia, chub, leather catfish and snakehead) having their HR values more than 1.0.

Here, we report the first investigation of the toxicokinetics and oxidative stress of F-53B in adult zebrafish. Adult male and female zebrafish were exposed to 10 and 100 μg/L of F-53B for 7 days followed by a 5-d depuration period to examine bioaccumulation, distribution, and depuration of F-53B in fish. The results showed that F-53B was readily accumulated in fish tissues with log BCF values of 2.36–3.65, but was eliminated slowly (t 1/2 = 152.4–358.5 h). F-53B accumulation was greater in males than in females and the concentration in tissues decreased in the following order: gonad ≈ liver ≫ gill ≫ brain in females and liver ≈ gill ≫ gonad ≫ brain in males, showing sex- and tissue- specific accumulation of F-53B in fish. After chronic exposure to F-53B for 28 days, a significant dose-dependent increase in histopathological changes in the liver were mainly manifested by vacuolation. Furthermore, F-53B also significantly reduced the enzyme activity (or content) of most of the measured oxidative stress-related markers (e.g., SOD, CAT and MDA) except for an increase in GSH-Px activity, indicating that oxidative stress was induced in zebrafish after treatment with F-53B. The results of this study provide important information on the toxicokinetics and toxic effects of F-53B, which will contribute to the ecological risk assessments of F-53B released into surface waters. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.01.010,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Rivers;Animals;Article;Chromatography;Oxidative Stress;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;ecotoxicity;sex difference;bioaccumulation;animal tissue;chemistry;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);adult;alkanesulfonic acid;oxidative stress;liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;risk assessment;toxicity;drug effect;liver toxicity;ecotoxicology;tissue distribution;toxicokinetics;F-53B;animal model;zebra fish;toxicity testing;river;depuration;catalase;Zebrafish;Sewage;enzyme activity;Toxicokinetics;environmental impact;histopathology;cyprinid;Danio rerio;glutathione peroxidase;superoxide dismutase;malonaldehyde;fresh water;water analysis;reaction kinetics;pharmacokinetics;Fresh Water;Alkanesulfonates;sewage;Water Pollutants;long term exposure;water quality;cell vacuole;Chemical;4;2;5;1;3;Liquid;6;2-((6-chloro-1;2-tetrafluoroethanesulfonic acid;6-dodecafluorohexyl)oxy)-1;6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate;Toxic effects,NA,NA

Although some of these compounds are potentially highly source-specific and sufficiently degradation-resistant, their capacity as sedimentary biomarkers remains under-investigated. Distinct series of long-chain 1-chloro-n-alkanes have previously been reported in three species of European saltmarsh vegetation; however, these compounds have never been further investigated in a more diverse plant population. Here we report the presence of similar series with a typical higher plant odd/even carbon number predominance in species of Australian mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation, including the black mangrove Lumnitzera racemosa, the grass Sporobolus virginicus and samphire, supporting the potential use of long-chain 1-chloro-n-alkanes as halophyte biomarkers. Based on carbon stable isotope values, which were reported here for the first time, and similarities in their distributions, we propose that the biosynthetic pathway of chloroalkanes is linked to that of other n-alkyl plant wax components.

Previously, using zebrafish as a model vertebrate, we found larvae exposed to a mixture of 29 POPs based on average blood levels from the Scandinavian population showed hyperactivity, and identified perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as the driving agent for the behavioral changes. In order to identify possible mechanisms, we exposed zebrafish larvae from 6 to 96 h post fertilization to the same mixture of POPs in two concentrations or a single PFOS exposure (0.55 and 3.83 μM) and performed behavioral tests and transcriptomics analysis. Behavioral alterations of exposed zebrafish larvae included hyperactivity and confirmed previously reported results. Transcriptomics analysis showed upregulation of transcripts related to muscle contraction that is highly regulated by the availability of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ingenuity pathway analysis showed that one of the affected pathways in larvae exposed to the POP mixture and PFOS was calcium signaling via the activation of the ryanodine receptors (RyR). Functional analyses with RyR inhibitors and behavioral outcomes substantiate these findings. Additional pathways affected were related to lipid metabolism in larvae exposed to the lower concentration of PFOS. By using omics technology, we observed that the altered behavioral pattern in exposed zebrafish larvae may be controlled directly by mechanisms affecting muscle function rather than via mechanisms connected to neurotoxicity. © 2020 The Author(s)",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109702,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;animal;concentration (parameter);female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;persistent organic pollutant;pollutant;animal tissue;lipid metabolism;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;toxicity;embryo;human;priority journal;blood;chemical analysis;animal model;zebra fish;real time polymerase chain reaction;calcium;upregulation;Zebrafish;health impact;Vertebrata;cyprinid;Danio rerio;transcriptomics;behavioral response;locomotion;Water Pollutants;Calcium Signaling;Chemical;omics;Transcriptomics;larva;Larva;caffeine;RNA sequencing;Behavior;hyperactivity;swimming speed;muscle contraction;calcium signaling;Calcium signaling;dantrolene;experimental behavioral test;ryanodine receptor;Ryanodine receptors;sarcoplasmic reticulum;Humanities;Humanism,NA,NA

Recent studies have detected FTAs at low concentrations (ng/L) in precipitation and surface waters; however, information regarding chronic toxicity is lacking. The present study assessed the chronic toxicity of the 8:2 saturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (8:2 FTCA) to Chironomus dilutus and the 10:2 saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (10:2 FTCA and 10:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid [FTuCA]) to Daphnia magna in separate life-cycle tests. In D. magna tests the FTCA was consistently more toxic than the FTuCA. Lethal concentrations (LC50s) were 150 and >60 μg/L for FTuCA and FTCA, respectively. Reproduction was significantly reduced relative to the controls, with respective median effective concentrations (EC50s) for time to first brood and mean number of offspring/female of 287 and 214 μg/L for FTuCA and 50 and 48 μg/L for FTCA. In tests with C. dilutus, EC50s for survival and growth at 20 d were 2,610 and 1,250 μg/L.

Few adults emerged and no reproduction occurred at the two highest concentrations (600 and 1540 μg/L). Mean number of eggs/female was not affected. These results represent the first chronic toxicity data for FTCAs and additional evidence that FTCAs are more toxic than some PFCAs.

In this study, the competitive adsorption behavior and mechanism of six traditional and emerging PFASs on anion-exchange resin IRA67 in the bisolute and mixed systems were studied. The adsorption equilibrium of the long-chain PFASs was at least 96 h whereas 48 h was required for the short-chain PFASs. When the PFASs were co-removed in the bisolute system, their competition was not obvious at low PFAS concentration of 0.01597 mmol/L due to the relatively adequate adsorption sites. When the concentrations of PFASs were increased to 0.07666 mmol/L, the removal of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) decreased by 77.78% and 72.09%, respectively. The competitive experiments showed that the adsorbed short-chain PFASs could be replaced by the long-chain ones, which was closely related to their hydrophobicity, backbone and functional groups. With the increase of solution pH from 3 to 7, the polyamine groups on the resin IRA67 were transferred to the base forms and the effective adsorption sites decreased, resulting in a more obvious competitive replacement behavior. This study suggested that the PFASs with long chain could be more effectively removed from the coexisting PFASs solution by the anion-exchange resins, and the short-chain PFASs in water may be removed when high dosage of anion-exchange resins is applied or the solution pH is decreased. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.jcis.2019.09.066,PFASs;Article;Adsorption;unclassified drug;analytic method;hydrophobicity;perfluoroalkyl substance;tandem mass spectrometry;ultra performance liquid chromatography;polyfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;Ions;pH;Competitive adsorption;perflubutane;fluorine derivative;adsorption kinetics;anion exchange resin;Adsorption mechanism;Anion exchange resins;Ion exchange resins;Adsorption behavior;Anion exchange resin;polyamine;Anion Exchange Resins,NA,NA

The results showed that a compact PFOS layer was generated at the rutile surfaces, and the assembling structures and dynamic profiles were crystal-face-dependent. PFOS molecules were attached to the (110) and (001) surfaces mainly by the sulfonate headgroups. A well-defined monolayer was formed on the (110) surface with the perfluorinated alkyl chains nearly perpendicular to the substrate, whereas the C-F chains were inclined at an angle (30-75°) and formed a hemicylinder-like configuration on the (001) surface. On the other hand, the perfluorinated amphiphiles interacted with the (100) plane through both the sulfonate headgroups (relatively strong electrostatic attraction) and the C-F tailgroups (weak van der Waals forces) and yielded an irregular assembling pattern. Water molecules were mostly concentrated more than 17.0Å away from the solid surfaces and formed a continuous solvent layer, suggesting the super hydrophobicity of perfluorinated alkyl chains.

We found that the Ti4O7 electrode loaded with amorphous Pd clusters significantly outperformed the Ti4O7 electrode loaded with crystalline Pd particles due to enhanced electron transfer through dominant Pd-O bonds. Combined with the efficient binding of PFOA and its degradation intermediates to the fluorinated electrode surface, this electrode was capable of mineralizing PFOA and releasing fluoride as F-.

Field studies aiming at evaluating the pollutant transfer from MAFOR to livestock remain scarce. They are mainly based on sewage sludge application in grasslands and they do not allow estimating the impact of other forms of MAFOR. Taking into account the available knowledge on pollutants transfer to animal products, it appears that organic pollutants are more strongly absorbed and transferred than Trace Metals (TM). Mainly non metabolized pollutants significantly accumulate in animal products: organic pollutants generally concentrate in fatty tissues and products while TM are preferentially found in offal. However, a serious lack of knowledge about the behavior of emerging organic contaminants (brominated perfluorocarbons, phthalates, paraffin) or certain TM (vanadium, thallium) has to be noted.

This has been home to sources of PFAS air-emissions from Teflon-coating operations for over 50 years. Since 2015, the Vermont and New York Departments of Environmental Conservation have documented ∼1200 residential wells and two municipal water systems across a 200 km2 area contaminated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Given the large areal extent of the plume, and the fact that much of the contaminated area lies up-gradient and across rivers from manufactures, we seek to determine if groundwater contamination could have resulted primarily from air-emission, land deposition, and subsequent leaching to infiltrating groundwater. Sampling of soils and groundwater in the Green Mountain National Forest (GMNF) downwind of factories shows that both soil and groundwater PFOA contamination extend uninterrupted from inhabited areas into conserved forest lands. Groundwater springs and seeps in the GMNF located 8 km downwind, but >300 meters vertically above factories, contain up to 100 ppt PFOA.

As the most common PFOS alternative, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (6:2FTS) and its salts have been increasingly used. However, little is known about its photochemical decomposition. This paper reports the ferric ion-induced efficient decomposition and defluorination of 6:2FTS under 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) irradiation; the underlying mechanisms were also investigated. In the presence of 100 μmol/L ferric ion and at pH 3.0, the first-order decomposition rate constant of 6:2FTS (10 mg/L) was 1.59/hr, which was 6 times higher than for direct UV photolysis. The effects of the ferric ion concentration and the solution pH on the 6:2FTS photodecomposition were investigated and the optimal reaction conditions were determined. In addition to fluoride and sulfate ions, shorter-chain PFCAs (C2–C7) were detected as major intermediates. The addition of hydrogen peroxide or oxalic acid accelerated the decomposition of 6:2FTS under UV irradiation, but not its defluorination, indicating that hydroxyl radicals can directly react with 6:2FTS but not with the shorter-chain PFCAs. Accordingly, a mechanism for 6:2FTS photochemical decomposition in the presence of ferric ion was proposed, which comprises two reaction pathways. First, hydroxyl radicals can directly attack 6:2FTS, leading to C[sbnd]C bond cleavage. Alternatively, 6:2FTS coordinates with ferric ion to form Fe(III)-6:2FTS complexes, which can undergo ligand-to-metal charge transfer under UV irradiation, causing C[sbnd]S bond cleavage. © 2016",NA,10.1016/j.jes.2016.08.010,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;fluorocarbon;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;chemistry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;sulfonate;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;ion;Ions;pH;Charge transfer;Electroplating shops;Chains;ultraviolet radiation;Ultraviolet Rays;iron;chemical model;Chemical;Models;decomposition;Rate constants;photochemistry;ferric ion;hydroxyl radical;Irradiation;Photolysis;6:2 Fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2FTS);Decomposition rate constants;Ferric Compounds;Ferric ion;Ferric ions;Ligand-to-metal charge transfers;Oxalic acid;Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) alternative;Photo-decomposition;Photochemical decompositions;Photochemical Processes;Photodecomposition;Sulfones,NA,NA

Traditional soil remediation procedures have not been successful in reducing or removing them from the environment. Therefore, this review focuses on new phytoremediation techniques for PFAS contamination of soils and water.

Nevertheless, the behaviour of trace organics in coagulation processes is currently poorly understood because of the complex interactions between these compounds, the coagulants and dissolved organic matter (DOM). This study assessed the coagulation removal from synthetic secondary effluent of twenty-four compounds including ten PFAS and four brominated flame retardants. Testing involved two coagulants (alum, ferric chloride) and five DOM surrogates (resorcinol, benzoic acid, citric acid, tannic acid, humic acid); DOM surrogates had assorted molecular weights, structures, charges, and hydrophobicity. With coagulant doses of 14 mg Fe/L and 4 mg Al/L, ten trace organics were removed by >30 % in the presence of at least one DOM surrogate. Humic acid effected the highest removals owing to complexation of trace organics and subsequent co-removal by adsorption or sweep floc. For instance, removal extents for three brominated diphenyl ethers were 60 to 75 % with Al and 50 to 88 % with Fe (initial concentration 0.4 to 0.8 ng/L); PFTDA, a long-chain PFAS, was removed by 87 and 91 % with Fe in the presence of tannic or humic acid, respectively (initial concentration 0.03 μg/L). The varying coagulation performance of different treatment works in terms of trace substance removal can be explained because of the site-specific DOM characteristics.

Given the complex nature of mixtures of environmental pollutants in aquatic systems together with the persistent and bioaccumulative properties of PFOS, this study aimed at evaluating the long-term effects and toxicity-increasing behavior of PFOS . in vivo using the zebrafish (. Danio rerio). Fish were maintained in flow-through conditions and exposed to single and binary mixtures of PFOS and the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) at nominal concentrations of 0.6, 100 and 300. μg/L and 10, 200 and 400. μg/L, respectively. F1 and F2 generations were evaluated from 0 to 180 days post-fertilization (dpf) and F3 generation was evaluated from 0 to 14 dpf. Survival was documented in all generations, whereas growth, fecundity, fertilization rate, histological alterations (in liver, thyroid and gonads) and vitellogenin (Vtg) induction in males were evaluated for F1 and F2 generations. Data for growth were collected at 30, 90 and 180 dpf and data for histological evaluations and Vtg induction were analyzed at 90 and 180 dpf. No significant effects on survival were seen in the F1 generation in any treatment following 180 d exposure; however, in the F2 generation, 300. μg/L PFOS both alone and in combination with BPA (10, 200 and 400. μg/L) induced 100% mortality within 14 dpf. PFOS (0.6 and 300. μg/L) did not increase the Vtg-inducing potential of BPA (10, 200 and 400. μg/L) in a binary mixture. In contrast, binary mixtures with 300. μg/L PFOS suppressed the Vtg levels in F1 males at 90 dpf when compared to single BPA exposures. Whereas the lowest tested PFOS concentration (0.6. μg/L) showed an estrogenic potential in terms of significant Vtg induction, Vtg levels were generally found to decrease with increasing PFOS-exposure in both F1 and F2 generations. In F1 generation, BPA-exposure was found to increase Vtg levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Histological analyses of F1 and F2 fish revealed hepatocellular vacuolization, predominantly in males, following PFOS-exposure both alone and in combination with BPA. Hepatotoxicity by PFOS might explain the suppressed Vtg response seen in PFOS-exposed F1 and F2 males. PFOS-exposed fish also showed granulomas, mainly in the liver. Given previous reports of the immunosuppressive potential of PFOS, the granulomas could be a consequence of a PFOS-induced reduction of the immune response potential. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the presence of PFOS increases the endocrine potential of BPA could not be confirmed in zebrafish. Adverse effects on liver structure and survival were only seen at concentrations well above ecologically relevant concentrations; however, the decline in survival rates following PFOS-exposure seen over generations again documents the importance of long-term studies for the investigation of persistent environmental pollutants. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.04.003,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;exposure;Animals;Liver;Thyroid Gland;Phenols;male;Male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;ecotoxicity;survival;animal tissue;in vivo study;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);sulfonate;toxicity;liver toxicity;article;mortality;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;priority journal;endocrine disruptor;Endocrine Disruptors;zebra fish;Zebrafish;histopathology;cyprinid;Danio rerio;liver cell;histology;fertility;vitellogenin;Vitellogenins;Bisphenol A;Water Pollutants;Statistics;fertilization;Gonads;cell vacuole;thyroid disease;Histocytochemistry;Chemical;4;4' isopropylidenediphenol;phenol;immune deficiency;Nonparametric;gonadal disease;liver granuloma;Long-term;Mixture;Vitellogenin;Sulfones,NA,NA

However, many commercial chemicals are ionic or ionizable and require different tools and approaches for their assessment. In recent years this task starts to obtain increasing attention but our understanding for their environmental fate is still far behind that for neutral chemicals. This review first gives an overview on the principles that govern ionic partitioning in environmental systems which are more complex than the simple partition processes of neutral chemicals. Second, a summary of our current knowledge on various topics such as bioaccumulation, sorption in soils, and nonspecific-toxicity reveals that ionic species can actually be quite hydrophobic contrary to commonly held beliefs. Eventually, we discuss existing models for the quantitative prediction of organic ions' sorption in soils and biota. We have to assert that the available model tools are quite restricted in their application range compared to neutral chemicals which is due to the higher complexity of the various ionic sorption processes. In order to further advance our understanding more high-quality sorption data are needed with a focus on multivalent and zwitterionic ions in all partition systems as well as cations in biological matrices.",NA,10.1007/398_2019_37,Bioaccumulation;Adsorption;Soil;Sorption;Intermolecular interactions;Organic Chemicals;Cations;0;Index Medicus;Ionizable organic chemicals;Modelling;Speciation,NA,NA

All samples were analysed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for PBDEs and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for PFASs and HBCDs, using an in-house developed analytical procedure. The brominated flame retardants (BFR) levels in livers were negligible: E10PBDEs reached a maximum value of 0.079 mu g/kg, whereas HBCDs were not quantified in almost all of the samples analysed. BFR concentrations in muscles were higher, but not significantly therefore, for E10PBDEs lower bound, a mean value of 0.045 mu g/kg (0.005-0.155 mu g/kg range) was measured, while a-HBCD was quantified with a maximum of 0.084 mu g/kg in 9 of the samples. Only two muscles contained all 3 HBCD isomers at concentrations of approximately 0.200 mu g/kg.

An important issue facing both the scientific and chemical regulatory communities is the extent to which PFOS concentrations in biota are attributable to direct exposure versus metabolism of PFOS-precursors (higher molecular weight derivatives that can be biotransformed to PFOS). Given that certain branched PFOS-precursors are chiral, we hypothesized that nonracemic proportions of PFOS isomers in biological samples could be used as a marker of significant exposure to PFOS-precursors. In this proof-of-principle study we examined the enantiomer-specific biotransformation of a high-purity model PFOS-precursor isomer: C6F13C*F(CF3)SO2N(H)CH2(C6H4)OCH3 (named 1 m-PreFOS hereafter, and whereby * indicates the chiral carbon center). A method for the enantiospecific separation of a compound with a long perfluoroalkyl chain and a chiral center was developed and applied to evaluate the enantioselectivity of 1m-PreFOS biotransformation in human liver microsomes. Gradient elution in reversed-phase mode on a Chiralpak IC column permitted the near-baseline separation of the two enantiomers (Ell and E2, nomenclature based on retention order) in 65 min. Microsome incubations demonstrated that El and E2 were metabolized at significantly different rates; k(E1) = 6.5(+/-0.3) x 10(-2) min(-1) (half-life = 10.6 min) and k(E2) = 5.2(+/-0.3) x 10(-2) min(-1) (half-life = 13.3 min), respectively.

Toxicity was only observed at concentrations well above environmental levels. The toxicity of the PFAS mixture generally followed that of the individual substances, but the mixture reduced the potencies of individual PFASs. BCF was determined for all nine PFASs and ranged between 0.9 (PFPeA) and 2700 (PFOS). Long-chain PFASs (C8) and PFASs with sulfonate as an active group showed the greatest toxic potential, while short-chain PFASs (C6 and C7) also caused significant behaviour alterations and accumulated in the embryos.

PFASs have been shown to interact with blood proteins and are suspected of causing a number of pathological responses, including cancer. Given this threat to living organisms, we carried out a broad review of possible sources of PFASs and their potential accumulation in agricultural plants, from where they can transfer to humans through the food chain. Analysis of the literature indicates a direct correlation between PFAS concentrations in soil and bioaccumulation in plants. Furthermore, plant uptake largely changes with chain length, functional group, plant species and organ. Low accumulations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) have been found in peeled potatoes and cereal seeds, while short-chain compounds can accumulate at high levels in leafy vegetables and fruits. Significant variations in PFAS buildup in plants according to soil amendment are also found, suggesting a particular interaction with soil organic matter. Here, we identify a series of challenges that PFASs pose to the development of a safe agriculture for future generations. Highlights • Main sources of PFASs for plants are polluted water and biosolids. • Content and type of soil organic matter affect plant uptake of PFASs. • Extent of PFAS accumulation depends on their chain length and functional groups. • Sulfonated PFASs are commonly less taken up than those with carboxylic groups and the same number of carbon atoms. • Leaf of cereals and vegetables can accumulate high levels of short-chain PFASs.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2018.10.023,Perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;Soil amendments;Bioaccumulation in plants;Plant species,NA,NA

They can occur in saliva and stool, and on scalp hair together with skin. Further, MPs can end up in the human diet through seafood, honey, salt, and mineral water. They can be taken up into the plants' roots and lead to the occurrence of MPs in fruits and vegetables. Concentration of the airborne MPs was also reported in the environment. These pieces of evidence clarify that introduction of MPs to the human body through ingestion and inhalation routes should not be overlooked. Following oral exposure to MPs, hazardous chemicals can be released in the gastrointestinal tract leading to toxicity. Inhalation route deserves more attention due to the oxidative potential of the inhaled plastic particles. Although the major characteristics of MPs are being investigated, there are currently few regulations to control concentration of MPs in the environment and their human health impacts remained unclear indicating the need for further investigation. For instance, it is not clear if the present air quality limits for PM 2.5 and PM 10 can be used for the areas with high suspended plastic particles. Without comprehensive knowledge about the retention and egestion rates of field populations, it is difficult to deduce the ecological and human health consequences. In general, more information about MP contamination in various species and the consequences of MP uptake and retention is required to gain a better idea of MPs in the food web and their environmental fate. The finer details on the MP translocation between tissues and the fate of the small plastic particles might be obtained when considering the existing information about the application of MPs in the pharmaceutical industry.

The load of short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (< C8) in the fetus liver was as high as that of the sows, whereas the concentrations of long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (≥ C8) were lower than in the dams. This result shows for the first time that fetuses take up PFAA from their mothers in utero. Our study shows that PFAA content in wild boar livers is comparably high in all animals in a local population and indicates a need for further research regarding a nationwide background exposure to PFAA in wild boars and their surrounding environment. © 2022, The Author(s).",NA,10.1007/s11356-022-23086-6,PFAS;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Environmental pollution;chemical pollutant;Animals;Liver;Swine;Pregnancy;animal;female;fluorocarbon;bioaccumulation;PFAA;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);alkanesulfonic acid;risk assessment;Risk assessment;carboxylic acid;Germany;pig;octanoic acid;Caprylates;pregnancy;wild population;environmental quality;Sus scrofa;Poly-;North Rhine-Westphalia;perfluorinated substances;Wild boar,NA,NA

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an important PFAS, and considerable attention has been paid to its hepatotoxicity and reproductive and developmental impact, while potential nephrotoxic effects are largely ignored, especially in fish. This study documents the structural and ultrastructural effects on kidney of common carp Cyprinus carpio exposed to waterborne PFOA at an environmentally relevant concentration of 200 ng L−1 and at 2 mg L−1. Dilation of the glomeruli capillary bed, increased vesiculation in the proximal tubular segment, compromised mitochondria, apical blebbing, and sloughing of collecting duct cells occurred in exposed fish, primarily at 2 mg L−1. Perfluorooctanoic acid exposure resulted in higher numbers of rodlet cells (RC), putative immune cells exclusive to fish, mainly in the renal interstitium, than seen in controls, increased association with cells of myeloid lineage and modifications to ultrastructure. No differences in other cells of innate immunity were observed. Despite the absence of severe histological lesions, PFOA was shown to affect both nephron and hemopoietic interstitium at high concentration, raising concern of the impact on renal and immune function in fish. The response of RCs to PFOA concentration of 200 ng L−1 suggests a potential role as a biomarker of PFOA exposure. © 2022 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113407,Article;nonhuman;controlled study;biomarker;Biomarker;persistent organic pollutant;animal tissue;perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;toxicity;kidney;animal cell;innate immunity;carp;mitochondrion;cell proliferation;teleost;bone marrow cell;ultrastructure;cell;immunocompetent cell;kidney function;kidney proximal tubule;Per-;Teleost;hematopoietic tissue;poly-fluoroalkyl substances;capillary;kidney interstitium;nephron;Nephrotoxicity;Rodlet cell;Ultrastructure analysis,NA,NA

We examined the environmental impact of ski wax use at an outdoor recreation area with significant cross-country ski activity by measuring PFAS levels in melted snow, soil and water following a collegiate ski race. We found extremely high levels of long- and short-chain PFAS (C4–C14) contamination in snow at the race start line (∑[PFAS] 7600–10,700 ng/L), with the longer-chain analytes (C10–C14) predominating. The complement of 14 PFAS detected in snow matched what has been found in ski wax. This snow contamination was greatly reduced at a point 3.9 km into the race. Soil at the start line contained the four most predominant PFAS in snow at a mean individual concentration of 2.81 ng/g dry weight. Control soil contained only perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), not found in other soil samples, at a concentration of 2.80 ng/g. Shallow groundwater from an on-site well contained only the shorter-chain PFAS (C4–C8), with a mean individual concentration of 4.95 ng/L. Our results suggest that ski wax use, from which fluorocarbons abrade at very high levels onto snow during a ski race, are the main source of PFAS contamination at our site.

In the present study, concentrations of PFAS were analyzed in Swedish peregrine falcon eggs (Falco peregrinus), collected between 1974 and 2007. Analytes included in the study were perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs; carbon chain lengths C6-C15), perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs; C4, C6, C8, and C10), and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA). The predominant PFAS was perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFOS (83 ng/g wet weight (w wt) mean concentration in samples from 2006), followed by perfluorotridecanoate, PFTriA (7.2 ng/g w wt) and perfluoroundecanoate, PFUnA (4.2 ng/g w wt). PFCA concentrations increased exponentially over the studied time. In contrast, concentrations of PFOS and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) increased initially but leveled off after the mid 1980s. This is different from previously observed temporal trends in marine organisms. The present study is the first to establish temporal trends for PFAS in terrestrial biota. The results indicate potential differences between marine and terrestrial biota regarding sources of PFAS exposure and response to emission changes. The toxicological implications of PFAS exposure for the falcons are not known, but according to recent findings impaired hatching success and sublethal toxicological effects from PFOS exposure in the Swedish peregrine falcon cannot be ruled out. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/es100028f,Eggs;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Carboxylation;Perfluorooctane sulfonamide;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Sulfur compounds;Sweden;Temporal trends;Falco peregrinus;Surface-Active Agents;Chromatography;High Pressure Liquid;Hydrocarbons;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;Marine biology;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;raptor;bioaccumulation;perfluoro compound;perfluorotridecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;egg;marine environment;pollution exposure;perfluorooctane sulfonamide;surfactant;hatching;article;trend analysis;ecotoxicology;Wet weight;Environmental contaminant;Perfluorinated alkyl substances;Falconidae;Falconiformes;Peregrine falcon;Potential difference;Raptors;Surface active agents;temporal analysis;Toxicological effects;reproductive success;Mean concentrations;Hatching success;Quality Control;perfluorooctane sulfonic acid;Concentration (process);Water analysis;Analytes;Carbon-chain length;Emission change;land biome;Marine organisms;perfluorinated carboxylic acid derivative;perfluorinated sulfonic acid derivative;Perfluorinated surfactants;sublethal effect;sulfonate (ester);Terrestrial biota;Ovum,NA,NA

Chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate has received increased attention due to its potential risk to ecosystems. However, its toxicity in the soil organisms remains unclear. In the present study, a comparative investigation was conducted on the toxicities of 6:2 Chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B) and PFOS to the earthworm Eisenia. fetida. F-53B was significantly more acutely toxic to earthworms than PFOS, with median lethal concentrations of 1.43 and 1.83 mmol/kg dry soil ( 816 and 984 mg/kg dry soil), respectively. Although both F-53B and PFOS, at 0.4 mmol/kg dry soil (=228 and 215 mg/kg dry soil) caused oxidative stress in earthworms, as evidenced by increased superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase activities as well as malondialdehyde level, the stress caused by F-53B was higher than that caused by PFOS. In transcriptomic and metabolomic studies, negative effects of PFOS and F-53B were observed on several metabolic processes in earthworms, including protein digestion and amino acid absorption, lipid metabolism, and the immune response. Compared with PFOS, F-53B exhibited a weaker disruption of lipid metabolism, comparable potency for toxicity to the immune response, and a stronger potency in extracellular matrix destruction along with apoptosis and ferroptosis induction. Hence, our data suggest that F-53B is more toxic than PFOS to earthworms. The findings provide some new insights into the potential toxicity of F-53B to soil organisms.

PFOS markedly increased two subtypes of potassium currents, including transient outward current and delayed rectifier current, at doses over 10 μM. PFOS did not affect the amplitude of sodium current at all administrated doses (1, 10 or 100 μM) but clearly shifted the activation current-voltage curve toward negatively potential. Further, PFOS significantly altered the glutamate-activated current at all doses. Taken together these findings indicated that PFOS disturbs the neuronal physiological processes, which revealed the damage of this pollutant to nerve system and will be helpful for further exploration to its underlying mechanism. © 2009.",NA,10.1016/j.etap.2008.11.013,Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS);nonhuman;controlled study;pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;article;priority journal;neurotoxicity;Neurotoxicity;animal cell;rat;glutamic acid;ion channel;sodium channel;Rattus;hippocampus;Glutamate-activated current;ion current;nervous system injury;patch clamp;potassium channel;Potassium channel;potassium current;Sodium channel;sodium current;Ion Channels;Rats;Sulfones;Glutamic Acid;Glutamates;Neurons,NA,NA

A portion of this unknown organofluorine likely originates in proprietary fluorinated surfactants not included in LC-MS/MS analyses and not fully characterized by the environmental science community, which may enter the environment through use in aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs) for firefighting. Contamination of water, biota, and soils with various PFASs due to AFFF deployment has been documented. Ten fluorinated AFFF concentrates, 9 of which were obtained from fire sites in Ontario, Canada, and two commercial fluorinated surfactant concentrates were characterized in order to identify novel fluorinated surfactants. Mixed-mode ion exchange solid phase extraction (SPE) fractionated fluorinated surfactants based on ionic character. High resolution mass spectrometry assigned molecular formulas to fluorinated surfactant ions, while collision induced dissociation (CID) spectra assisted structural elucidation. LC-MS/MS detected isomers and low abundance fluorinated chain lengths. In total, 12 novel and 10 infrequently reported PFAS classes were identified in fluorinated chain lengths from C3 to C15 for a total of 103 compounds.

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Orbitrap-MS) employing a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) interface operated in negative mode was used for the quantitative determination of these contaminants. HPLC separation of analytes was achieved using a reversed phase C18 (RP-C18) analytical column. The efficiency of various solid phase extraction (SPE) columns for the pre-concentration and clean-up as well as the performance of different ionization sources and detection modes for the instrumental determination were evaluated. The validation results indicate recoveries of analytes between 88 and 116%, while the intra-day and inter-day precision parameters in terms of relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 1.0–5.9% and 1.5–7.3%, respectively. The measured values for certified reference material (CRM) agreed with the provided reference values, revealing the accuracy of obtained concentrations in the range of 107–108%. The trueness of the method was verified by a successful participation in a proficiency testing (PT) program.

In the Chinese Xiaoqing River Basin, the C8homologue was the most prevalent compound of the emerging series of chlorinated perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (Cl-PFCAs) and perfluoroalkylether carboxylic acids (PFECAs). In contrast, C6and shorter homologues were dominant in the German Alz River. This indicates that the phaseout of long-chain compounds in Europe and their ongoing production in Asian countries also apply to unregulated emerging PFAS classes. Additional characteristics to differentiate the point sources were the peak area ratio of perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) versus the emerging compound hydro-substituted PFBS (H-PFBS) as well as the occurrence of byproducts of the sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based polymer Nafion.

The effects of salmon origin (wild or hatchery-reared), feeding area (Baltic Main Basin, Bothnian Sea, and Gulf of Finland), and OHC concentration on the differences in hepatic proteome of salmon were investigated. Multi-level analysis of the OHC concentration, transcriptome, proteome, and oxidative stress biomarkers measured from the same salmon individuals were performed to find the key variables (origin, feeding area, OHC concentrations, and oxidative stress) that best account for the differences in the transcriptome and proteome between the salmon groups. When comparing wild and hatchery-reared salmon, differences were found in xenobiotic and amino acid metabolism-related pathways. When comparing salmon from different feeding areas, the amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways were notably different. Several proteins found in these pathways are correlated with the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The multi-level analysis also revealed amino acid metabolic pathways in connection with PCBs and oxidative stress variables related to glutathione metabolism. Other pathways found in the multi-level analysis included genetic information processes related to ribosomes, signaling and cellular processes related to the cytoskeleton, and the immune system, which were connected mainly to the concentrations of Polychlorinated biphenyls and Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and their metabolites.

The bioconcentration factor (BCF) indicated that the plants affinity to PFOA accumulation was; E. crassipes, > P. salicifolium, > C. congestus, > P. x canescens, > P. amphibian, > F. carica, > A. schmidtiana, > X. strumarium, > P. australis, > R. maritime, > S. corymbosus.

The highest BCF was observed in sediment for which its core water had a high salinity, total organic carbon and a pH which was near neutral. As the studied plants had a higher affinity for PFOA, the resultant effect is that riparian plants such as E. crassipes, X. strumarium, and P. salicifolium, typified by a fibrous rooting system, which grow closer to the water edge, exacerbate the accumulation of PFOA in riparian wetlands. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",NA,10.1080/15226514.2013.810574,Fluorocarbons;Rivers;South Africa;fluorocarbon;chemistry;water pollutant;perfluorooctanoic acid;drug effect;article;Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA);metabolism;sediment;river;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;Geologic Sediments;bioremediation;perfluorinated compounds;Water Pollutants;Biodegradation;wetland;Chemical;plant root;Environmental;Plant Roots;Wetlands;angiosperm;Angiosperms;bioconcentration factor (BCF);reed grass;wetland plants,NA,NA

This study aimed to detect and quantify 15 PFASs in the muscle and liver of 40 roe deer from a specific area in Northern Italy by UPLC-HRMS. In the roe deer, liver PFAS concentrations were higher than those seen in muscle (p < 0.05). Although PFAS content in animals from urbanized areas was higher than those found in deer from rural areas, this difference was not statistically significant. In female roe deer, the concentration was higher than in males (p < 0.05); moreover, older animals showed higher concentrations of PFASs in the liver than younger animals (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the amount of PFASs was higher in tissues from roe deer belonging to urbanized areas, showing that this species might serve as a good bioindicator due to its territorial behavior. PFAS content was significantly higher in female roe deer, although the reason is not fully known. Finally, PFAS concentration was higher in the liver of older animals, probably due to compromised hepatic function. © 2024 by the authors.",NA,10.3390/ani14040529,PFAS;Article;female;male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;biological monitoring;biomonitoring;controlled study;animal tissue;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;adult;urban area;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;muscle;liver;mass spectrometry;ultra performance liquid chromatography;rural area;ecotoxicology;perfluorononanoic acid;endocrine disruptor;limit of quantitation;limit of detection;age;wild animal;sex;high-resolution mass spectrometry;2H perfluoro 2 decenoic acid;6 2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid;8 2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid;endocrine disruptors;Northern Italy;Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;Perfluorobutanoic acid;Perfluoroheptanoic acid;Perfluorooctanesulfonamide;Perfluoropentanoic acid;polyfluorinated alkyl substances;roe deer;Sodium dodecafluoro 3H 4 8 dioxanonanoate;wild animals;Italy;Liver,NA,NA

There were two control groups: control (only fish) and solvent control (DMSO and fish). After exposure times, the blood samples and tissues (gill, liver, muscle, brain, and kidney) were taken from the fish. The physiological (hematocrit) and genotoxic (micronucleus) parameters were done with the blood samples. The biochemical parameters (the advanced oxidative protein products, AOPP and glutathione, GSH) were done with the muscle, gill, brain, and liver samples. While the micronucleus and nuclear abnormalities increased, the hematocrit values decreased in the 1 mg/L PFOS-exposed groups during 96 h and 21 days. The AOPP values of the muscle, gill, brain, and liver tissues significantly changed in PFOS-exposed groups at both exposure times (P < 0.05). Unlike AOPP, glutathione levels of gill did not change in both PFOS-exposed groups at 96 h (P > 0.05). Histopathological changes were seen in the gill, liver, and kidney tissues after exposure to PFOS. Therefore, even low concentrations of PFOS have genotoxic, biochemical, and histopathological effects on carp.

The PFASs concentrations in water from the upstream across the rural area reflected the background level due to the extremely low concentration and very few detected PFASs. The consumer products and metal plating/textile were the predominant pollution sources of PFASs in winter and summer, respectively, for both water and sediment samples. Integrating the determined baseline value, the distribution of PFASs concentrations, and the ecological risks of PFASs, three criteria were proposed, which divide the PFASs concentrations in water into four pollution levels, i.e., insignificant, low, medium, and high. According to the suggested criteria, 96.4% of the PFASs levels in upstream was insignificant pollution, which decreased to 50.4% in downstream and 50.8% in reservoirs. The PFASs in China's and world's surface waters demonstrated similar pollution patterns, with PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxA being the top 3 polluted PFASs.

To evaluate the toxicity of these compounds and how they affect the environment, it is important to perform systematic ecotoxicological and physicochemical studies. The best way to address this problem is to conduct studies on different aquatic trophic levels. In this work, an ecotoxicological study of six drugs (anhydrous caffeine, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, gentamicin sulphate, lidocaine hydrochloride, tobramycin sulphate and enalapril maleate) that used three aquatic biological models (Raphidocelis subcapitata, Aliivibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna) was performed. Additionally, the concentration of chlorophyll in the algae R. subcapitata was measured. Furthermore, EC50 values were analysed using the Passino and Smith classification (PSC) method, which categorized the compounds as toxic or relatively toxic. All of the studied drugs showed clear concentration-dependent toxic effects. The toxicity of the chemicals depended on the biological model studied, with Raphidocelis subcapitata being the most sensitive species and Aliivibrio fischeri being the least sensitive.

For these reasons global RMMs have been imposed on the manufacture and use of select PFAS. To evaluate the occurrence and potential current risk of PEAS in the Ontario environment, PFAS were quantitatively measured in source waters pre- (2005-2007) and post- (2012-2016, 2018-2019) implementation of RMMs. Source water samples were collected pre- (n = 105), and post-RMMs (n = 326) from lake, river and groundwater and analyzed for up to14 PFAS. Pre-RMMs, the most frequently detected PFAS in source water were perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; 83%) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; 76%) followed by perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS; 47%) and the maximum Sigma PFAS(10) was 42.1 ng/L. Post-RMMs, the maximum Sigma PFAS(10) (which includes PFOS) was statistically significantly reduced to 15.5 ng/L, well below the Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines for PFOS. To evaluate post-RMMs risk to human health, 226 drinking water samples were collected from 25 drinking water systems with conventional and advanced treatment. All individual (or LPFAS) concentrations are well below current and proposed Health advisory levels or regulatory guidelines/standards for PEAS in drinking water with calculated Risk Quotients (RQ) <0.02.

The rotifer Plationus patulus, a basal member of riverine food webs, was used to test acute and chronic toxicity of 4 PPCPs (acetamidophenol, caffeine, fluoxetine, triclosan). A population from a remote site in Mexico (reference population) and one from an urbanized stretch of the Rio Grande were exposed. Acute toxicity tests show that both populations were more sensitive to fluoxetine. Chronic exposure to acetamidophenol (10mg/L, 15mg/L, and 20mg/L) inhibited reference population growth, whereas Rio Grande population growth was inhibited only at 15mg/L and 20mg/L. Population growth was inhibited at 200mg/L and 300mg/L of caffeine for both populations. Chronic exposure to fluoxetine (0.020mg/L) significantly inhibited population growth for the Rio Grande population only. Triclosan (0.05mg/L, 0.075mg/L, 0.10mg/L) had the most deleterious effects, significantly reducing both populations' growth rates.

They have been produced since the 1950s, resulting in a global contamination of the environment and wildlife. They are resistant to biodegradation and have the tendency to bio-accumulate in organisms and bio-magnify in the food chain. However, little is known about the bioaccumulation of PFAAs in terrestrial invertebrates, including how they af-fect the physiology and particularly oxidative status. Therefore, we studied the bioaccumulation of PFAAs in snails that were exposed for 3 and 6 weeks along a distance gradient radiating from a well-known fluorochemical hotspot (3M). In addition, we examined the potential effects of PFAAs on the oxidative status of these snails. Fi-nally, we tested for relationships between the concentrations of PFAAs in snails with those in soil and nettles they were feeding on and the influence of soil physicochemical properties on these relationships. Our results showed higher concentrations of PFOA and/or PFOS in almost every matrix at the 3M site, but no concentration gradient along the distance gradient. The PFOS concentrations in snails were related to those in the nettles and soil, and were affected by multiple soil properties. For PFOA, we observed no relationships between soil and biota concen-trations. Short-chained PFAAs were dominant in nettles, whereas in soil and snails long-chained PFAAs were dominant. We found a significant positive correlation between peroxidase, catalase and peroxiredoxins and PFAA concentrations, suggesting that snails, in terms of oxidative stress (OS) response, are possibly susceptible to PFAAs pollution. Capsule: We observed a positive correlation between the levels of PFAAs and the antioxidants peroxidase, catalase and peroxiredoxins in snails, exposed on nettles grown at contaminated sites.

Although much work has been done, the toxigenicity of PFCs remains largely unknown. In this work, the non-covalent interactions between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and serum albumin (SA) and DNA were investigated under normal physiological conditions, aiming to elucidate the toxigenicity of PFCs. Results: In equilibrium dialysis assay, the bindings of PFOS to SA correspond to the Langmuir isothermal model with two-step sequence model. The saturation binding number of PFOS was 45 per molecule of SA and 1 per three base-pairs of DNA, respectively. ITC results showed that all the interactions were spontaneous driven by entropy change. Static quenching of the fluorescence of SA was observed when interacting with PFOS, indicating PFOS bound Trp residue of SA. CD spectra of SA and DNA changed obviously in the presence of PFOS. At normal physiological conditions, 1.2 mmol/l PFOS reduces the binding ratio of Vitamin B2 to SA by more than 30%. Conclusion: The ion bond, van der Waals force and hydrophobic interaction contributed to PFOS binding to peptide chain of SA and to the groove bases of DNA duplex. The non-covalent interactions of PFOS with SA and DNA alter their secondary conformations, with the physiological function of SA to transport Vitamin B2 being inhibited consequently.

NIST and multiple groups have been measuring the mass fraction of a group of emerging contaminants, polyfluorinated substances (PFASs), in a variety of SRMs. Here we report levels determined in an interlaboratory comparison of up to 23 PFASs determined in five SRMs: sediment (SRMs 1941b and 1944), house dust (SRM 2585), soil (SRM 2586), and sludge (SRM 2781). Measurements presented show an array of PFASs, with perfluorooctane sulfonate being the most frequently detected. SRMs 1941b, 1944, and 2586 had relatively low concentrations of most PFASs measured while 23 PFASs were at detectable levels in SRM 2585 and most of the PFASs measured were at detectable levels in SRM 2781.

Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as Cmale/Cfemale (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important.

Diet can be an important route of PFEA exposure, but the presence of PFEAs in food is poorly understood. Extraction methods for food samples exist for traditionally studied PFAS, but their suitability for PFEAs and other novel PFAS remains unknown. In this study, an extraction and matrix cleanup method was developed to quantify 45 PFAS, including 13 PFEAs, 3 perfluoroalkane sulfonamides, and 6 fluorotelomer carboxylic acids in 10 types of fruits and vegetables. Homogenized samples were extracted with basic methanol, and resulting extracts were diluted with water and cleaned up using solid-phase extraction with weak anion-exchange cartridges. The method was validated by performing spike-recovery experiments at spike levels of 1 ng/g in all 10 matrices and 0.1 ng/g in 2 matrices. For PFAS without a corresponding isotopically labeled internal standard (IS), adopting an IS with a similar chromatographic retention time generated the most accurate recoveries. Dependent upon the matrix, recoveries of 38-44 PFAS (including 10-13 PFEAs) fell within 50-150% for samples spiked at 1 ng/g. Recoveries of 40 and 38 PFAS in blueberries and corn, respectively, fell within 50-150% for samples spiked at 0.1 ng/g. Method quantification limits (MQLs) of PFAS in pure solvents were determined as the lowest calibration level with an accuracy between 70 and 130%. To compensate for matrix effects, a matrix factor was applied on the basis of the analyte response in different matrices relative to the pure solvent. The MQLs of 45 PFAS (including 13 PFEAs) in 10 matrices ranged from 0.025 to 0.25 ng/g.

Previous studies have focused on the toxicity of NPs itself, often ignoring the important effects of exposure routes. Here, we evaluated the impact of different exposure routes (waterborne, foodborne, and coexposure) of 80 nm polystyrene NPs on intestinal accumulation and inflammatory response using zebrafish. Our results demonstrated that aqueous and dietary exposures led to both time- and dose-dependent bioaccumulation of NPs, damaged intestinal structure, and induced immune cells and genes in the intestine. While waterborne exposure caused lower NPs accumulation than foodborne exposure, both demonstrated similar immunotoxicity in the intestine. In addition, co-exposure can lead to a higher accumulation of NPs and toxicity in zebrafish, suggesting that the risk of environmental exposure may be underestimated, as current toxicity assessments have focused on single-route exposure scenarios. We further revealed that NPs activated downstream genes of the toll-like 4 receptor, suggesting that NPs can cause an inflammatory response. Our study is the first known to report that exposure to NPs via different routes induces an accumulation in the intestine and can cause similar intestinal disturbance effects, providing new insights for adequately assessing the potential risks of NPs.",NA,10.1021/acsestwater.3c00392,character(0),NA,NA

The correlation of cross-species data supports a unique perspective that humans can be regarded as a sentinel for PFAS effects in other species. The health harms due to PFAS are potentially most concerning for populations of endangered and threatened species that are simultaneously exposed to PFAS and other toxic pollutants, and also face threats to their survival due to habitat loss, degradation of ecosystems, and over-harvesting. Human epidemiological studies on the PFAS doses associated with health harm present a rich source of information about potential impacts on wildlife health due to PFAS.

We measured PBDEs and PCBs, together with stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes as an index of trophic level, in low-trophic-level organisms collected from a coastal area in Tokyo Bay. PBDEs were biomagnified to a lesser degree than PCBs. The more hydrophobic congeners of each were biomagnified more. However, the depletion of BDE congeners BDE99 and BDE153 from fish was suggested. To study congener-specific biotransformation of halogenated compounds, we conducted an in vitro experiment using hepatic microsomes of two species of fish and five BDE congeners (BDE47, 99, 100, 153, and 154) and five CB congeners with the same substitution positions as the PBDEs. BDE99 and 153 were partially debrominated, but BDE47 and 154 were not debrominated. This congener-specific debromination is consistent with the field results. Both in vitro and field results suggested selective debromination at the meta position. The CB congeners were not transformed in vitro. This result is also consistent with the field results, that PCBs were more biomagnified than PBDEs. We conclude that metabolizability is an important factor in the biomagnification of chemicals, but other factors must be responsible for the lower biomagnification of PBDEs in natural ecosystems.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.092,Japan;Organohalogen compounds;Polybrominated diphenyl ethers;Biotic communities;Biotransformation (Metabolism);Debromination;Nitrogen isotopes;Tokyo Bay (Japan);Ethers;Ether,NA,NA

Nine different PFCs were measured in eleven mollusk species (soft tissues) collected from 9 coastal cities. Most of the analyzed PFCs could be detected in the samples, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as the prominent PFC, although perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been shown to be more bioaccumulative than PFOA by other studies. The detection frequency of PFOA was 72%. Significantly high levels of PFOA were found in Mactra veneriformis, Scapharca subcrenata and Meretrix meretrix Linnaeus, with mean concentrations at 31.3 ng g(-1), 15.0 ng g(-1) and 12.2 ng g(-1), respectively (dry weight). The distinct distribution of PFOA in these species can be used as a potential indicator of the bioaccumulation capacity. PFOS was found in mollusks at lower concentrations and frequency (61%). Positive linear regressions were found between perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), PFOA and PFOS (p < 0.01, n = 123), suggesting that these compounds may come from a similar origin of exposure and accumulation. It is suspected that higher emissions from usage or production of PFC related products might exist in Shouguang City, since the majority of the elevated concentrations of PFOA or PFOS were found in Shouguang.

Considerable research has been conducted on submerged bottom sediment in long, straight channels. However, less attention has been paid to the junction of a plain river network where the hydrodynamic disturbance of confluence dominates. To date, the release mechanism of PFCs in confluence channels has not been revealed quantitatively. In this study, we carried out a series of flume experiments to evaluate the effect of varied discharge ratios of mainstream and tributary waters on the efflux of PFCs from sediment. The results demonstrate that the convergence of tributary water can affect the mainstream water significantly. The two most obvious features are the separation zone and the maximum velocity zone. The release of PFCs in sediment is correlated with the flow velocity. The discharge in the separation zone is low, and the discharge in the maximum velocity zone is high. The release of PFCs in water bodies, including the true soluble phase, colloid phase, and particle phase, increase with an increase to the discharge ratio. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is more widely distributed in the true dissolved phase, and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) dominates in the colloid and particle phases.

Plastic sleeves were sampled from an oyster aquaculture farm and the PIOM was isolated from the intertidal, subtidal, and sediment-buried segments to investigate the levels of metal(loid)s, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and explore the microbial community composition. Results indicated that the PIOM present on long-term aged high-density polyethylene plastic harbored high concentrations of metal(loid)s, PAHs, and PFAS. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the bacterial composition in the PIOM differed by habitat type, which consisted of potentially pathogenic taxa including Vibrio, Shewanella, and Psychrobacter. This study provides new insights into PIOM as a potential sink for hazardous environmental contaminants and its role in enhancing the vector potential of plastic.

In this study, we evaluated the sorptive removal behavior of PFOS from aqueous solution using three forms of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), namely, nitrate-, carbonate- and chloride-intercalated LDHs. Batch experiments showed that the sorption process was very fast with an equilibrium time of 10 -60 min. The nitrate-LDH had the greatest ability to remove PFOS with a removal rate of 99.7% at an initial concentration of 100 mg/L and the maximum uptake capacity reached 865 mg/g. The sorption kinetic and equilibrium data could be fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively. The intraparticle diffusion model suggests that both external diffusion and intraparticle diffusion are the rate-limiting processes for PFOS sorption onto the LDHs. The initial pH, background electrolyte concentration and coexisting ions influenced the sorption of PFOS by the LDHs. It was concluded that both surface adsorption and anion exchange were involved in the PFOS sorption onto the LDHs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

PFAS have been found all across the planet, from the polar regions to the global ocean. Global oceans have emerged as a substantial sink for the carbon in the environment due to their remarkable capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon. Oceans absorb around 24% of the world's CO2 emissions. Thus, the ocean plays a prominent role in the earth's carbon cycle. However, the widespread application of PFAS in a wide range of products and the inefficient management of PFAS-containing wastes made them ubiquitous pollutants, which are increasingly getting as a pollutant of emerging concern. Marine PFAS pollutants can produce harmful effects on gas exchange and the ocean's carbon cycle. Thus, it leads to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which eventually adversely affects global warming and climate change. Consequently, threats of marine PFAS to oceans carbon sequestration are discussed in this paper. Marine PFAS pollutants adversely affect the following sectors: (1) The growth and photosynthesis of phytoplankton, (2) development and reproduction of zooplankton by causing toxicity in zooplankton, (3) marine biological pomp, and (4) carbon stock of oceans. In this way, marine PFAS can pose a threat to ocean carbon sequestration. It is expected that this study can develop knowledge about the potential impact of PFAS on ocean carbon sequestration.

We measured the concentrations of 15 PFAAs in liver and kidney samples of 16 species of stranded cetaceans from Hawai'i and other tropical North Pacific regions utilizing high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Eleven PFAAs in liver and nine PFAAs in kidney were detected, including substantial perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA). Regression models indicated that phylogenetic family and age class significantly influenced concentrations of certain PFAAs. PFAAs can activate transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which induces transcription of cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A). Relative expression of PPARα and CYP4A mRNA was quantified using real-time PCR (qPCR) and CYP4A protein expression, using Western blot and then compared to PFAA concentrations in liver and kidney. Concentrations of four PFAA congeners, summation of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (ςPFCAs), and ςPFAAs correlated significantly with PPARα mRNA expression and CYP4A protein expression in kidney, suggesting either may be biomarkers of PFAA exposure in cetaceans. This is the first study to quantify PFAAs in marine mammals from this region and the first observation of a direct relationship between PFAA exposure and PPARα and CYP4A expression in cetaceans. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.8b05619,Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Hawaii;Chromatography;animal;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;biological marker;biomarker;alkyl group;animal tissue;perfluoro compound;protein;Mammals;Mass spectrometry;Biomarkers;chemical compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;concentration (composition);marine environment;Regression analysis;high performance liquid chromatography;liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;gene expression;liver tissue;biota;Cytology;mass spectrometry;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha;Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor;PPAR alpha;carboxylic acid;kidney tissue;Pacific Ocean;Pacific Ocean (North);Western blotting;age;protein expression;real time polymerase chain reaction;detection method;temporal analysis;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids;phylogeny;Phylogeny;Mammalia;messenger RNA;Proteins;Polymerase chain reaction;High performance liquid chromatography;High-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometries;induced response;aquatic organism;Cytochrome p450;phylogenetic tree;Cetacea;Liquid;gender;cetacean;Transcription;age class;Cytochrome P-450 CYP4A;cytochrome P450 4A;Protein expressions;Real-time PCR (qPCR);Regression model,NA,NA

A new and fast analytical method is described here for the analysis of these compounds in the edible part of fish samples. The method uses a simple liquid extraction by sonication, followed by a direct determination using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The linearity of the instrumental response was good, with average regression coefficients of 0.9971 and 0.9979 for PFOS and PFOA, respectively, and the coefficients of variation (CV) of the method ranged from 8% to 20%. Limits of detection (LOD) were 0.04ng/g for both the analytes and recoveries were 90% for PFOS and 76% for PFOA. The method was applied to samples of homogenized fillets of wild and farmed fish from the Mediterranean Sea. Most of the samples showed little or no contamination by perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid, and the highest concentrations detected among the fish species analyzed were, respectively, 5.96ng/g and 1.89ng/g.

Plastics have been categorized as emerging pollutants particularly in the marine environment due to their ubiquity and persistence, particularly microplastics (< 5 mm, MPs). Numerous studies reported the occurrence of MPs in the marine environment (surface water, sediments). However, neither there exist standardized nor harmonized methods to evaluate their potential toxicity and their role as vector of hazardous chemicals into organism. This thesis had three main objectives, (1) the investigation of sorption of chemicals models on MPs, (2) the study of the toxic potential of these sorbed chemicals on zebrafish and (3) the characterization and the study of the toxicity of environmental MPs. The first part of the thesis aimed at the investigation of the sorption processes of three model pollutants - perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and oxybenzone (BP3) - on pristine MPs using different sizes and polymer types. The second part studied the vectorization of the three compounds sorbed on MPs toward zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, juveniles and adults through direct or trophic exposures, and their toxicities. The third part investigated the toxicity of environmental samples of MPs from two sandy beaches (Guadeloupe Island, France), using the same procedure as above, as well as the characterization of additives and adsorbed chemicals through a non-target approach. Study of pollutants sorption demonstrated differences in pattern (e.g. kinetics, sorption efficiency), depending on size particles and chemical used. Potential adverse effects of MPs associated with chemicals were investigated in zebrafish embryos using OECD 236 guideline and by using a chronic exposure from larvae or juveniles up to 5-months old adults through trophic exposure. Molecular and individual toxicological endpoints were monitored during exposure.

The aim of this study was to determine signatures that could link morphological phenotypes to the toxicity mechanisms of four Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs): bisphenol A (BPA), perfluorooctanesulfonate potassium salt (PFOS), tributyltin chloride (TBT), and 17-ß-estradiol (E2). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) eleutheroembryos were exposed from 2 to 5 dpf to a wide range of BPA, PFOS, TBT and E2 concentrations. At the end of the exposures several morphometric features were assessed. Common and non-specific effects on larvae pigmentation or swim bladder area were observed after exposures to all compounds. BPA specifically induced yolk sac malabsorption syndrome and altered craniofacial parameters, whereas PFOS had specific effects on the notochord formation presenting higher rates of scoliosis and kyphosis. The main effect of E2 was an increase in the body length of the exposed eleutheroembryos. In the case of TBT, main alterations on the morphological traits were related to developmental delays. When integrating all morphometrical parameters, BPA showed the highest rates of malformations in terms of equilethality, followed by PFOS and, distantly, by TBT and E2. In the case of BPA and PFOS, we were able to relate our results with effects on the transcriptome and metabolome, previously reported. We propose that methodized morphometric analyses in zebrafish embryo model can be used as an inexpensive and easy screening tool to predict modes of action of a wide-range number of contaminants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.105232,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;Estradiol;Phenols;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;animal tissue;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;principal component analysis;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;toxicity;drug effect;embryo development;embryology;Embryonic Development;embryo;morphology;human;infant;ecotoxicology;priority journal;endocrine disruptor;Endocrine Disruptors;phenol derivative;tributyltin;zebra fish;toxicity testing;morphometry;Zebrafish;nonmammalian embryo;absorption;cyprinid;Danio rerio;kyphosis;phenotype;transcriptome;Benzhydryl Compounds;benzhydryl derivative;histology;least square analysis;Least-Squares Analysis;Principal Component Analysis;organotin compound;Toxicity Tests;estradiol;Embryo;Endocrine disruption;Dose-response;multivariate analysis;Water Pollutants;body height;Multivariate Analysis;Morphology;yolk sac;pharmacology;Chemical;4;4' isopropylidenediphenol;larva;Larva;Survival Analysis;body size;Nonmammalian;developmental delay;metabolome;scoliosis;swim bladder;survival analysis;anatomy;cranium;EDCs;eleutheroembryo;Eleutheroembryo;Trialkyltin Compounds;tributyltin chloride,NA,NA

Significantly higher concentrations of summed polychlorinated biphenyls (sumPCB7) in eggs collected from Barentsburg (2980 ng/g lipid weight (lw)) and Pyramiden (3860 ng/g lw) compared to Longyearbyen (96 ng/g lw) are attributed to local sources of PCBs within these settlements. Similar findings were observed for p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE) where higher median concentrations observed in Pyramiden (173 ng/g lw) and Barentsburg (75 ng/g lw) compared to Longyearbyen (48 ng/g lw) may be influenced by guano inputs from breeding seabird populations, although other point sources cannot be ruled out. Concentrations of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and several perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in snow bunting eggs were found to be statistically higher in the populated settlements of Longyearbyen and Barentsburg compared to the abandoned Pyramiden. Narrow foraging ranges of snow buntings during breeding season was useful in assessing point sources of exposure for PCBs and PFAS at particular sites with extreme differences observed between nest locations. SumPCB7 concentrations ranged from 2 μg/g ww to below detection limits between nest sites located less than a kilometer from each other in Pyramiden. Similar findings were observed in Longyearbyen, where several PFCAs ranged from 2 to 55 times higher between nest sites with similar spatial distances.

However, it is unclear whether PFHpA affects Leydig cell development during puberty. The 35-day-old Sprague Dawley male rats were exposed to PFHpA by gavage with 0 (corn oil), 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day for 21 days. PFHpA did not affect the body weight of rats, but it reduced testis weight, relative testis weight, and epididymis weight at 100 mg/kg. It significantly increased serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels at a dose of 100 mg/kg without affecting serum estradiol levels. PFHpA suppressed sperm production at a dose of 100 mg/kg. PFHpA induced Leydig cell hyperplasia (increased number of CYP11A1-positive Leydig cells) at a dose of 100 mg/kg, but down-regulated the expression of Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, and Cyp17a1 in individual Leydig cell pe se and up-regulated the expression of Fshr in the Sertoli cell pe se. PFHpA did not affect the number of HSD11B1 (a biomarker for more mature Leydig cells) positive Leydig cells and SOX9 positive Sertoli cells. PFHpA increased BCL2, and the phosphorylation of AKT1, AKT2, ERK1/2, and JNK, but decreased BAX levels. However, it had no effect on SIRT1 and PGC-1α levels. In conclusion, PFHpA induces Leydig cell hyperplasia due to the increase in the secretion of luteinizing hormone through negative feedback after down-regulating the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and inhibiting testosterone production in individual Leydig cells. This proliferation may be mediated by increasing BCL2 and phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, and JNK, and decreasing BAX level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.tox.2020.152633,Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Rats;Spermatogenesis;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;gene expression;dose response;drug effect;pathology;perfluoroheptanoic acid;animal cell;animal model;Western blotting;down regulation;rat;age;cell maturation;peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha;physiology;cytochrome P450;histopathology;ultraviolet spectrophotometry;RNA extraction;steroidogenesis;cell proliferation;phosphorylation;Sprague Dawley rat;estradiol;estradiol blood level;Age Factors;immunohistochemistry;testosterone;spermatogenesis;hyperplasia;luteinizing hormone;follitropin;protein bcl 2;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;puberty;sexual maturation;Sexual Maturation;Sertoli cell;Sprague-Dawley;heptanoic acid derivative;Heptanoic Acids;PFHpA;Perfluoroheptanoic acid;corn oil;protein kinase B;3beta hydroxy delta5 steroid dehydrogenase;chemoluminescence;cholesterol monooxygenase (side chain cleaving);cytochrome p450 17a1;epididymis;Hyperplasia;Immature Leydig cells;Leydig cell;leydig cell hyperplasia;Leydig cell hypoplasia;Leydig Cells;mitogen activated protein kinase 1;mitogen activated protein kinase 3;protein Bax;real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;stress activated protein kinase;testis tissue;testis weight;Testosterone short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances;transcription factor Sox9,NA,NA

A total of 200 fosfomycin-resistant strains were obtained from food animals and their surrounding environments, with the fosA, fosA3, and fosA7.5 genes being detected in 26% (52/200), 10% (20/200), and 5% (10/200), respectively. Surprisingly, three fosA7.5-producing E. coli isolates were found to be concomitant with fosA3. Most of the fosA-like-gene-positive isolates were multidrug-resistant strains and consistently possessed bla(CTX- M-1/CTX-M-9), floR, and bla(TEM) genes. Only fosA3 was successfully transferred to the recipient strains, and the 29 fosA3-carrying transconjugants exhibited high-level resistance to fosfomycin (MIC >= 512 mu g/ mL). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) combined with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) analyses indicated that fosA3 or fosA7.5 genes were spread by horizontal transfer as well as via clonal transmission between E. coli. We used the PCR mapping method to explore the genetic contexts of fosA-like genes, and two representative strains (fEc.1 and fEcg99-1) were fully sequenced. Six different genetic structures surrounding fosA3 were detected and one infrequent context was discovered among the conjugable fosA3-positive E. coli isolates. The five genetic environments of fosA were identified and found to be highly similar to the partial sequence of transposon Tn2921. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) results showed that fosA7.5 was colocalized with mcr-3, bla(CMY-63), sul3, tet(A), dfrA, and a number of virulence-related factors on the same chromosomes of strains, and various insertion sequences (IS3/ISL3) were detected upstream or downstream of fosA7.5. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that both fosA7.5- and fosA3-carrying E. coli ST602 and fosA7.5-carrying E. coli ST2599 were closely related to E. coli isolates from humans, which may indicate that they pose a threat to human health. IMPORTANCE Here, we report the widespread and complex genetic environments of fosA-like genes in animal-derived strains in China. The fosA7.5 gene was identified in this study and was found to confer resistance to fosfomycin. The high prevalence of fosA-like genes in farms indicates that food animals serve as a potential reservoir for the resistance genes. This study also discovered that fosfomycin resistance genes were always associated with mobile elements, which would accelerate the transmission of fosA-like genes in strains. Importantly, E. coli ST602 and ST2599 carrying fosA3 or fosA7.5 from food animals had high similarity to E. coli isolates from humans, suggesting that fosA-like genes can be transmitted to humans through the food chain, thus posing a serious threat to public health. Therefore, the prevalence of fosA-like genes isolated from animals should be further monitored.",NA,10.1128/spectrum.00545-22,China,NA,NA

In a previous study, the concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in grab samples collected from the waste water treatment plant (WWTP) of Bayreuth, a city of 72,000 inhabitants in Bavaria, Germany, during two periods showed considerable variability. For a better estimate of average mass flows, the surfactants were monitored (five samplings) from 16 March to 18 May 2007. In a second campaign, river water receiving the WWTP effluent was sampled twice a day for five consecutive days. Quantitative analysis was done by stable-isotope dilution, pre-cleaning, and pre-concentration by solid-phase extraction, and liquid chromatography followed by electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry. The mass flows of PFOA and PFOS through the WWTP were determined. PFOA is fully discharged into the river, while about half of PFOS is retained in the sewage sludge. The average daily mass load of the river Roter Main by the WWTP of Bayreuth is about 1.2 +/- 0.5 g PFOA and 5 +/- 2 g PFOS, with variations of up to 140% within one day.
