The transfer of particulate matter down to the deep is enhanced during atmosphere-driven, high-energy physical oceanographic processes like dense shelf water cascading (DSWC), which is caused by winter surface heat losses and evaporation. Here we present data from samples collected during winter 2012, when dense shelf water formation and subsequent cascading triggered the flushing of large amounts of PFASs through a submarine canyon to depths in excess of 1000. m. The finding of quantifiable concentrations of long-chain PFOA, PFOS and PFNA substances and significantly high concentrations of the short-chain substances PFHxA and PFBA indicates that these compounds, sorbed onto particulate matter, are quickly and directly transferred to the ocean's interior, thus highlighting the role of DSWC in removing those pollutants from the coastal ocean. Eventually, uncertainties about our results arising from the limited number of samples available are counterbalanced by their intrinsic value as intense DSWC events, like the one in 2012, occur only every 5-7. years in the study area, which seriously restricts sampling opportunities. Our results add PFASs to the list of persistent organic pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorobenzenes or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons known to be conveyed to the deep marine environment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.080,Pollution;Fluorocarbons;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;fluorocarbon;Marine pollution;unclassified drug;Organic pollutants;polychlorinated biphenyl;environmental monitoring;chemistry;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;geographic distribution;Mediterranean Sea;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;concentration (composition);marine environment;procedures;perfluorohexanoic acid;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;sea water;priority journal;suspended particulate matter;chemical analysis;seashore;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluoroheptanoic acid;perfluoropentanoic acid;perfluorotetradecanoic acid;perfluorobutanoic acid;sediment;perfluorodecanesulfonate;analysis;organic pollutant;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;Seawater;Geologic Sediments;perfluorohexadecanoic acid;perfluorooctadecanoic acid;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);concentration (parameters);perfluorooctanesulfonamide;winter;seasonal variation;chlorobenzene;pollution transport;perfluorobutanesulfonate;Aromatic hydrocarbons;Chains;environmental parameters;marine pollution;pollutant transport;Water Pollutants;Particulate Matter;Chemical;deep sea;Deep sea;particulate matter;Mediterranean Sea (Northwest);Dense shelf water cascading;Dense shelf-water cascading;dense water;North-western mediterranean seas;Oceanographic process;perfluorodecylphosphonic acid;perfluorohexasulfonate;perfluorohexylphosphonic acid;perlfuorooctylphosphonic acid;Settling particles,NA,NA

In this study, the enantiomer fractions (EFs) of chiral chlordanes and atropisomeric polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were determined in the blood plasma of adult male and female glaucous gulls from three breeding colonies in Svalbard. Plasma EFs were similar in magnitude and direction to El's previously reported in glaucous gulls from other arctic food webs, suggesting overall similarities in the biochemical processes influencing the EFs of bioaccumulated organochlorine (OC) contaminants within the food webs at those locations. Additionally, EFs in yolk of eggs collected concurrently from within the same nesting colonies varied with location, laying date, and OC concentrations, and may be influenced by changes in the local feeding ecology between those colonies. No differences were found between the El's for any analyte in female gulls compared to those found in egg yolk, indicating that processes involved in the maternal transfer of chlordanes and PCBs to eggs do not modulate the stereochemical ratio between enantiomers, Therefore, the use of eggs as a valuable and noninvasive means of OC biomonitoring may also extend to enantiomer compositions in glaucous gulls, and perhaps also in other seabird species from arctic regions.",NA,10.1021/es8000147,character(0),NA,NA

Fishmeal is an important animal feed applied around the world and is generally of marine origin. However, the levels and sources of PBDEs in fishmeal have not been thoroughly evaluated and their structural analogues have not been reported to date. The present study collected ninety-two fishmeal samples from world main fishmeal producing area to determine 27 PBDEs, 10 MeO-PBDEs and 11 OH-PBDEs. The concentrations of Sigma 27PBDEs, Sigma 10MeO-PBDEs and Sigma 11OH-PBDEs were in the ranges of 0.1-1498 (mean: 75.8), 1.14-881 (37.4) and 1.00-47.5 (8.17) ng/g lipid, respectively. PBDEs were found primarily correlated with the historically commercial production, meaning higher production of certain commercial product in a country, higher corresponding PBDE congeners in local fishmeal. A market shift from penta- and octa-formulations toward deca-formulation was observed. BDE209 was identified as a major congener in fishmeal. Both the MeO-PBDEs and the OH-PBDEs were influenced by fishmeal producing areas (p < 0.001). High MeO-PBDEs were identified in the Southeast Asian fishmeal, which might be due to the suitable environmental conditions for the generation of bromoperoxidase-contained algae in local area. The ratio of two major MeO-PBDE congeners, 6-MeO-BDE47/2'-MeO-BDE68, were generally >1 in the northern hemisphere and <1 in the southern hemisphere in the present study, which was consistent with the results obtained from previous published papers. Both MeO-PBDEs and OH-PBDEs were in accordance with the specialties of naturally produced halogenated compounds.

They are found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems, which are known to be sensitive to environmental impacts. Dolphins are considered sentinel organisms for monitoring the health of coastal marine ecosystems due to their role as predators that can bioaccumulate contaminants. Although recent studies have focused on capturing the circulating metabolomes of these mammals, and in the context of pollutants and exposures in the marine environment, skin and blubber are important surface and protective tissues that have not been adequately probed for metabolism. Using a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) based metabolomics approach, we quantified 51 metabolites belonging to 74 different metabolic pathways in the skin and blubber of stranded bottlenose dolphin (n = 4) samples collected at different localities in the Southern Zone coast of Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Results indicate that metabolism of skin and blubber are quantitatively very different. These metabolite abundances could help discriminate the tissue-types using supervised partial least square regression discriminant analysis (PLSDA). Further, using hierarchical clustering analysis and random forest analysis of the metabolite abundances, the results pointed to unique metabolites that are important classifiers of the tissue-type. On one hand, the differential metabolic patterns, mainly linking fatty acid metabolism and ketogenic amino acids, seem to constitute a characteristic of blubber, thus pointing to fat synthesis and deposition. On the other hand, the skin showed several metabolites involved in gluconeogenic pathways, pointing towards an active anabolic energy generating metabolism. The most notable pathways found in both tissues included: urea cycle, nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism among others. Our H-1 NMR metabolomics analysis allowed the quantification of metabolites associated with these two organs, i.e., pyruvic acid, arginine, ornithine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, and acetic acid, as discriminatory and classifying metabolites. These results would lead to further understanding of the functional and physiological roles of dolphin skin and blubber metabolism for better efforts in their conservation, as well as useful target biopsy tissues for monitoring of dolphin health conditions in marine pollution and ecotoxicology studies.",NA,10.1016/j.cbd.2019.02.004,character(0),NA,NA

Recently, these emerging PFASs were observed in estuary and marine areas with a pollution level of ng/L. In this study, three levels (10 ng L−1, 100 ng L−1 and 1000 ng L−1) for these PFASs were selected to investigate the response of marine Chlorella sp. to 14 days of exposure. The growth of Chlorella sp. was significantly inhibited by each PFAS over time. Treatments with 1000 ng/L exposure caused the most severe reduction in growth for each PFAS treatment. For the first half of the experimental period (from Day 0 to Day 6), the influence of each PFAS was not significant (p > 0.05). However, treatments with all concentrations of 6:2 Cl-PFAES, HFPO-DA and 1000 ng L−1 PFECHS significantly reduced the growth of Chlorella sp. from Day 8. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in Chlorella sp. were significantly increased (p < 0.05) when exposed to 6:2 Cl-PFAES, HFPO-DA and PFECHS. The catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities in Chlorella sp. were significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) by each PFAS. The glutathione (GSH) contents in Chlorella sp. were significantly increased by each PFAS. However, the increases in GSH concentration in Chlorella sp. were low. The inhibition of algal growth was primarily due to the reduction of the activities of CAT and POD. PFECHS had the lowest toxicity among the three PFASs, and it induced less oxidized damage to Chlorella sp. In conclusion, as alternatives to phased-out PFASs, the emerging PFASs are not safe in aquatic environment, and attention should be paid to the management and restriction of these emerging PFASs. Environmentally relevant emerging PFASs inhibited the growth of Chlorella sp. and affected the antioxidant response of algae. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.05.103,Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;Antioxidants;Article;Sulfonic Acids;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;Marine pollution;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;concentration (composition);oxidative stress;sulfonic acid derivative;toxicity;Toxicity;ecotoxicology;growth;growth rate;pollution effect;polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid;metabolism;glutathione;Glutathione;Estuaries;estuary;catalase;Propionic acid;aquatic environment;enzyme activity;environmental impact;superoxide dismutase;Enzymes;antioxidant;aging;concentration response;marine pollution;perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate;Water Pollutants;algae;Algae;antioxidant activity;development;Catalase;Chemical;Aquatic environments;2;1;3;green alga;algal growth;Chlorella;growth inhibition;Emerging PFASs;Propionates;peroxidase;3 tetrafluoro 2 (1;3 heptafluoropropoxy)propanoic acid;Long term exposure;Bioaccumulation potential;Anti-oxidant response;Chlorella sp.;Environmentally relevant concentration;HFPO2 compound;Long-term exposure;Marine microalgae;perfluoroethylcyclohexanesulfonic acid;Peroxidase;propionic acid derivative;Superoxide Dismutase;Superoxide dismutase activities;Growth Substances;Military Personnel,NA,NA

Samples of adult krill, caught from 12 sites distributed between 30 degrees and 80 degrees E (60-70 degrees S), were analysed for > 100 organohalogen compounds including chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated organic compounds and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs). Organochlorine pesticides dominated measured krill contaminant burdens with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) as the single most abundant compound quantified. Krill HCB concentrations were comparable to those detected at this trophic level in both the Arctic and temperate northwest Atlantic, lending support for the hypothesis that HCB will approach global equilibrium at a faster rate than other POCs. Para, para'-dichlorodiphenylethene (p,p'-DDE) was detected at notable concentrations. Measurements of DDT and its degradation products provide an important baseline for monitoring the temporal and geographical influence of renewed, DDT usage for malaria-control in affected southern hemisphere countries. In contrast to the Arctic, PCBs did not feature prominently in contaminant burdens of Antarctic krill. The major commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners -99 and -47 were quantified at low background levels with clear concentration spikes observed at around 70 degrees E, in the vicinity of modem, active research stations. The likelihood that local anthropogenic activities are supplementing low PBDE levels, delivered otherwise primarily via long range environmental transport, is discussed. The suspected naturally occurring brominated organic compound, 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA), was a ubiquitous contaminant in all samples whereas the only PCDD/Fs quantifiable were trace levels of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and 1,2,3,4,7,8/1,2,3,4,7,9-hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF). With the aims of, i) Generating a robust and broadly applicable POC auditing platform for the scarcely studied eastern Antarctic sector; ii) Determining the compounds accumulating in Antarctic krill for further toxicity evaluation studies and iii) Establishing a baseline for Antarctic predator exposure to POCs, this study represents one of the most comprehensive reports of POC contamination of the Antarctic food web to date.

Herein, multisegment injection-nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (MSI-NACE-MS/MS) is introduced as a high throughput approach for PFAS screening in serum samples following a simple methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) liquid extraction. Separation and ionization conditions were optimized to quantify low nanomolar concentration levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) from serum extracts when using multiple reaction monitoring under negative ion mode conditions. Multiplexed separations of PFOA and PFOS were achieved with excellent throughput (<3 min/sample), adequate concentration sensitivity (LOD ∼ 20 nM, S/N = 3) and good technical precision over three consecutive days of analysis (mean CV = 9.1%, n = 84). Accurate quantification of PFASs was demonstrated in maternal serum samples (n = 16) when using MSI-CE-MS/MS following pre-column sample enrichment with median concentrations of 3.46 nM (0.7-9.0 nM) and 3.29 nM (1.5-6.6 nM) for PFOA and PFOS, respectively. This was lower than average PFAS exposures measured in pregnant women who had serum collected prior to 2009 likely due to subsequent phase out of their production. Overall, this method offers a convenient approach for large-scale biomonitoring of environmental exposures to legacy PFASs and their emerging replacements that is relevant to maternal health and chronic disease risk assessment in children. © 2020 The Authors.

These areas are important sinks for many persistent organic pollutants. In this study, the concentration of legacy and emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in marine sediments from the YS and ECS were investigated. Nineteen PFAS were identified, ranging in concentration from 0.21 ng/g to 4.74 ng/g (mean: 1.60 ng/g). Legacy long-chain PFAS [e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)] were the dominant contaminants.

HFPO-DA was measured in all sediments in equivalent levels to PFOS (0.119 ng/g and 0.139 ng/g, respectively). This is the first reported occurrence of perfluoro-1-butanesulfonamide (FBSA) and HFPO-DA in marine sediments, indicating a replacement in the production of PFAS from legacy to emerging ones along with eastern coastal cities of China. The results of the potential source identification demonstrated that metal plating plants, textile treatments, fluoropolymer products, food packaging, and the degradation of volatile precursor substances were the main sources of PFAS in the ECS and YS. The environmental risk assessment based on the risk quotient demonstrated that PFOA and PFOS in the ECS and YS may present a low to medium risk at most sampling points. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131042,PFAS;Fluorocarbons;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Risk Assessment;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;Organic pollutants;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;persistent organic pollutant;chemical substance;concentration ratio;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;chemical compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;chlorination;concentration (composition);Spatial distribution;alkanesulfonic acid;source apportionment;urbanization;risk assessment;Risk assessment;organofluorine derivative;Pacific Ocean;perfluorononanoic acid;sediment;chemical composition;temporal analysis;Propionic acid;spatial analysis;Sediments;sediment pollution;environmental risk;Alkanesulfonates;surface water;Water Pollutants;food packaging;Chemical;2;1;3;Marine sediments;Source apportionment;HFPO-DA;3 tetrafluoro 2 (1;Yellow Sea;mathematical model;source identification;polyfluorinated ether sulfonate;Environmental risk assessment;3 heptafluoropropoxy)propanoic acid;East China Sea;Ocean sediments;perfluoro 1 butanesulfonamide;Yellow sea;China,NA,NA

To assess long-term exposure to HCAs, we developed a simple and sensitive method for measuring HCAs in hair by automated on-line in-tube solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column, 16 HCAs were analyzed within 15 min. The optimum in-tube SPME conditions were 20 draw/eject cycles of 40 mu L sample at a flow rate of 200 mu L min(-1) using a Supel-QPLOT capillary column as an extraction device. The extracted HCAs were easily desorbed from the column by passage of the mobile phase, with no carryover observed. This in-tube SPME LC-MS/MS method showed good linearity for HCAs in the range of 10-2000 pg mL(-1), with correlation coefficients above 0.9989 (n = 18), using stable isotope-labeled HCA internal standards.

The acute reference dose (%ARfD) and hazard ratios (HR) of major PFASs in biota were all <100 %, and also below 1, respectively, which means that consumption of PFASs from seafood does not pose risk and threat to human health. However, it should be taken into account that the HR of PFHxA in Mimachlamys nobilis reached 0.82. Potential adverse effects toward human health induced by short-chain PFASs (such as <6 C) via invertebrate seafood consumption should be concerned. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115112,Biochemistry;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Bioaccumulation;China;animal;concentration (parameter);fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;ecotoxicity;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;Health risks;water pollutant;chemical compound;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;Meats;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;risk assessment;adverse event;biota;human;Pacific Ocean;seashore;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluoroheptanoic acid;perfluoropentanoic acid;perfluorotetradecanoic acid;food intake;sediment;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;perfluorodecane sulfonic acid;health impact;marine species;habitat;perfluorohexadecanoic acid;sea food;Seafood;human activity;Shorter chains;Water Pollutants;Invertebrates;invertebrate;Chemical;Human health;macroinvertebrate;Hazard ratio;South China Sea;consumption behavior;Health implications;human activities;Invertebrate;Legacy;Mimachlamys nobilis;nonadecafluorodecanoic acid;novel perfluoroalkyl substance;novel PFASs;perfluorobutanoic Acid;scallop;South China;South China sea,NA,NA

PFAS are fluorinated substances whose unique properties make them effective surface-active agents with uses ranging from stain repellants to fire-fighting foams. In response to concerns about drinking water contamination and health risks from PFAS exposure, the United States Environmental Protection Agency published Health Advisories (HAs) for perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid. The occurrence of six PFAS in drinking water has been reported in the Third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3), and subsequent analysis of the dataset suggested that four percent of water systems reported at least one detectable PFAS compound and 1.3 percent of water systems reported results above the HAs. Many treatment technologies have been evaluated in the literature, with the most promising and readily applied treatment technologies being activated carbon, anion exchange resins, and high-pressure membrane systems.

To discover unknown PFASs, previous researchers have applied high-resolution mass spectrometer using fragmentation flagging approach with common fragment ion at the same retention time as the flags. However, it was difficult to search for their molecular ion from co-eluting peaks in the full-scan spectrum at a specific retention time. Here, we attempted to utilize drift time acquired by ion mobility spectrometry for making linkages between fragment ions and their molecular ions. For validating the process, standard solution spiked with PFASs were analyzed by liquid chromatography/ion mobility – quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/IM-QTOF-MS). Fluorinated fragment ions (fragmentation flags) were categorized into three classes: Class 1 (120 types of [CxFy]−), Class 2 (123 types of [CxFyO]−), Class 3 (131 types of [CxFyO3S]−) and all overlapping fragmentation flags detected at an identical retention time were bundled together as a “flag set”. Injecting standard mixed solution of 20 types of PFASs resulted in picking up 20 flag sets by fragmentation flagging. All the fragmentation flags were detected within a designated range of drift time, and their molecular ion was confirmed as a PFAS spiked in the standard solution even when co-eluting compounds were found at almost same retention time. This method was applied to a household fire extinguisher liquid, resulting in finding out nine molecular ions. Therefore, the new linking method achieved rapid searching for the prospective molecular ions using LC/IM-QTOF-MS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124644,Fluorocarbons;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Chromatography;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;controlled study;environmental monitoring;persistent organic pollutant;chemical substance;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;perfluoroalkyl substance;liquid chromatography;procedures;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;mass spectrometry;drinking water;organofluorine derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;halogenation;Halogenation;ion;Ions;detection method;chemical structure;Fluorinated compound;time of flight mass spectrometry;prospective study;Prospective Studies;Standard solutions;Liquid;Per-;retention time;Non-target analysis;ion mobility spectrometry;Ion Mobility Spectrometry;Quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry;polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);Ion mobility spectrometers;Fragmentation flagging;High resolution;Ion mobility spectrometry;Ion sources,NA,NA

As awareness and understanding of its prevalence, persistence, and potential health risks grows, so have concerns about human exposure. While drinking water has received substantial attention, dietary intakes have also been reported to contribute significantly to total exposure, with fish consumption in particular. Most studies of U.S. fish have targeted sport fish from areas of known or suspected contamination. This study was undertaken to improve data on PFAS levels in the U.S. commercial seafood supply. A total of 70 samples of finfish and shellfish were purchased at U.S. grocery stores and fish markets and analyzed for 26 PFAS compounds. The samples included a range of marine and freshwater species from four regions of the U.S. and seven countries with significant imports to the U.S. Up to ten PFAS were detected in 21 samples, with PFOS the predominant compound. There were no detections in the remaining 49 samples (detection limits of approximately 0.4–0.5 ppb). Total PFAS concentrations in most samples were single digit or sub-ppb levels. The exception was commercial finfish from the Great Lakes area, for which higher levels (up to 22 ppb) were observed in whitefish, walleye, and yellow perch fillet. Study findings suggest PFAS is present at low or non-detect levels in the U.S. commercial seafood supply and exposure is low for consumers of market basket fish and shellfish. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109932,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;chemical pollutant;Animals;Article;United States;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;controlled study;food contamination;animal tissue;chemical substance;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;fish;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;human;dietary exposure;Dietary exposure;priority journal;perfluorononanoic acid;detection method;Great Lakes [North America];health risk;Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS);food analysis;marine species;Fishes;sea food;Seafood;freshwater species;seafood;shellfish;Shellfish;Fish consumption;Water Pollutants;Chemical;finfish;fish consumption;market;Perca flavescens;Commercial fish;coregonine;Perca;Stizostedion vitreum,NA,NA

This review summarizes the biological monitoring of PFCAs, PFSAs, and related PFSs in wildlife and humans, compares concentrations and contamination profiles among species and locations, evaluatesthe bioaccumulation/biomagnification in the environment, discusses possible sources, and identifies knowledge gaps. PFSs can reach elevated concentrations in humans and wildlife inhabiting industrialized areas of North America, Europe, and Asia (2-30,000 ng/ mL or ng/g of wet weight (ww)). PFSs have also been detected in organisms from the Arctic and mid-ocean islands (< or = 3000 ng/g ww). In humans, PFSAs and PFCAs have been shown to vary among ethnic groups and PFCA/PFSA profiles differ from those in wildlife with high proportions of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. The pattern of contamination in wildlife varied among species and locations suggesting multiple emission sources. Food web analyses have shown that PFCAs and PFSAs can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Knowledge gaps with respect to the transport, accumulation, biodegradation, temporal/spatial trends and PFS precursors have been identified.

The biomarkers included neutral red retention, phagocytosis, and spontaneous cytotoxicity, all of which were tested on mussel hemocytes. Hemocytes are an important component of the invertebrate immune system. We found that exposure to PFASs could lead to reduced hemocyte cell viability and suppress immune function by up to 50% of normal performance within the experimental exposure range. The results indicate that PFASs have an immunotoxic potential and thus could pose severe health risks to aquatic organisms. The reported immunotoxicity is likely to result from the compounds’ direct and indirect interactions with the hemocyte membrane, and therefore likely to affect the functionality of these cells. The immunotoxic response was found to be related to the organism's burden of PFASs, and was reversible when the compounds were removed from the test organisms. Based on this relationship, models using an organism's PFAS concentration and bioaccumulation factor (BAF) as the independent variables were established to quantify PFAS-induced immunotoxicity. The models help us to gain a better understanding of the toxic mechanism of PFASs, and provide a tool to evaluate adverse effects for the whole group of compounds with one mathematical equation.

Accumulation and transformation as the result of environmental distribution may have long-term consequences; this is indicated by the ultimate accumulation and long-term bioactivity of several widely spread organochlorines, and is clearly evident in the decomposition of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere. Depending on the order of trophic levels biomagnifiaction factors of 10 000 up to 100 000 are encountered for persistent semivolatile organochlorines like 4,4'-DDE, PCB congeners or some Toxaphene constituents. Mammals show intra-species pollutant transfer during the lactation period. While the mother animal is partly depleting its body burden the calve accumulates in a critical period of its life via the milk a concentrated input of persistent organochlorines. A similar depletion phenomenon is also found for fish and crustacean which enrich in the eggs a substantial part of the accumulated body burden of the female.

Concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) were relatively stable between 1984-2010, increasing substantially in 2011; trends in perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) concentrations were not strictly linear over the study period. PBDE, HBCD, and PFCA trends in the HI population were opposite/different to that of many other arctic animals (e.g. polar bears) for the same time-period. Trends were inconsistent among locations, suggesting that regional differences in dietary exposure and/or sources may also impact these trends.

Here, we quantified long-term changes in plasma concentrations of 20 organochlorine and 16 perfluoroalkyl pollutants in king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus during the breeding and molting fasts, which are marked by low and high levels of protein catabolism, respectively, and by strong lipid use. The profile of measured pollutants in plasma was dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS, initial relative contribution of 60%). Initial total pollutant concentrations were similar in molting (3.3-5.7 ng g(-1) ww) and breeding penguins (range of 4.2-7.3 ng g(-1) wet weight, ww). Long-term fasting (25 days) for molting and breeding led, respectively, to a 1.8- and 2.2-fold increase in total plasma pollutant concentrations, although the rate and direction of change were compound-specific. Hexachlorbenzene (HCB) and PFOS concentrations increased in plasma (net mobilization) during both types of fasting, likely due to lipid use. Plasma perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) and perfluorotridecanoate (PFTrDA) concentrations increased in breeders (net mobilization) but decreased in molting individuals (net excretion), suggesting a significant incorporation of these pollutants into feathers.

Renal and branchial clearance rates (mL/d/kg) determined for all experiments averaged 19% and 81% of total clearance, respectively. Expressed as mean values for all experiments, the steady-state volume of distribution was 277mL/kg and the terminal half-life was 86.8 d. Additional animals were exposed to PFOS in water, resulting in an average calculated branchial uptake efficiency of 0.36%. The renal clearance rate determined in the present study is approximately 75 times lower than that determined in earlier studies with perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Previously, it was suggested that PFOA is a substrate for membrane transporters in the trout kidney. The present study suggests that glomerular filtration may be sufficient to explain the observed renal clearance rate for PFOS, although a role for membrane transporters cannot be ruled out.

The method was developed to replace old techniques which applied solid phase extraction and ultra-violet detection. The old methods had reached their limit of capacity regarding the number of samples and co-medicated drugs interfering with the detection. Serum samples were precipitated with zinc sulphate and methanol containing a stable isotope labelled analog for each analyte. Quantitative analysis was performed by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography combined with a tandem mass spectrometer using a Zorbax SB-C8 column (2.0 x 50 mm: 1.8 mu m) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water and methanol, respectively. The total run time of the chromatography was 4 min. Precision and trueness varied from 2.6% to 14.9% and 87.6% to 103.5%, respectively. At the lower limit of quantification, precision was up to 17.9% and trueness varied from 89.5% to 111.5%. A five point standard curve covering the clinically relevant ranges with a power function fit was applied for calibration. Ion suppression from matrix effects and internal standards were thoroughly investigated and are discussed. Process efficiency rates varied from 42% to 99%. The method has shortened the response time, reduced interference from other drugs, avoided acetonitrile usage, and reduced the amount of serum needed for analysis 50-fold. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesize that the presence, uptake, and accumulation of PFAS in aquatic vegetation (AV) is dependent upon several factors, such as the physiochemical properties of PFAS and proximity to potential sources. In this study, AV was collected from eight locations in Florida to investigate the PFAS presence, accumulation, and spatiotemporal distribution. PFAS were detected in AV at all sampling locations, with a range from 0.18 to 55 ng/g sum (∑)PFAS. Individual PFAS and their concentrations varied by sampling location, time, and AV species. A total of 12 PFAS were identified, with the greatest concentrations measured in macroalgae. The average bioconcentration factor (BCF) among all samples was 1225, indicating high PFAS accumulation in AV from surface water. The highest concentrations, across all AV types, were recorded in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), a location with a history of elevated PFAS burdens. The present study represents the first investigation of PFAS in naturally existing estuarine AV, filling an important gap on PFAS partitioning within the environment, as well as providing insights into exposure pathways for aquatic herbivores.

The primary sources of CECs in farmlands are agricultural inputs, such as wastewater, biosolids, sewage sludge, and agricultural mulching films. The percent increase in cropland area during 1950–2016 was 30 and the rise in land use for food crops during 1960–2018 was 100–500%, implying that there could be a significant CEC burden in farmlands in the future. In fact, the alarming concentrations (μg kg<sup>−1</sup>) of certain CECs such as PBDEs, PAEs, and PFOS that occur in farmlands are 383, 35 400 and 483, respectively. Also, metal nanoparticles are reported even at the mg kg<sup>−1</sup> level. Chronic root accumulation followed by translocation of CECs into plants results in their detectable concentrations in the final plant produce. Thus, there is a continuous flow of CECs from farmlands to agricultural produce, causing a serious threat to the terrestrial food chain. Consequently, CECs find their way to the human body directly through CEC-laden plant produce or indirectly via the meat of grazing animals. Thus, human health could be at the most critical risk since several CECs have been shown to cause cancers, disruption of endocrine and cognitive systems, maternal–foetal transfer, neurotoxicity, and genotoxicity.

We studied demographic, life-style and physiological determinants of serum PFAS concentrations in Swedish adolescents from a nation-wide survey, Riksmaten Adolescents 2016–17 (RMA, age 10–21 years, n = 1098). Serum samples were analyzed for 42 PFAS, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The cumulative probability model was used to estimate associations between serum PFAS and determinants, using ordinal logistic regression. Legacy linear (lin-) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononaoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), lin-perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and lin-/branched (br-) perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were quantifiable in ≥70% of the samples. The emerging PFAS 9-chlorohexanedecafluoro-3-oxanone-1-sulfonic acid (9Cl-PF3ONS) was quantified in 5.4% of the samples, suggesting initiation of long-range transport far from production sites. Median concentrations of all legacy PFAS were <2 ng/g serum, with a few participants having very high (>100 ng/g serum) lin-PFHxS and lin-/br-PFOS concentrations due to previous high exposure from PFAS-contaminated drinking water. Legacy PFAS exposure was strongly associated with birth country of the participants and their mothers. 2-fold higher estimated adjusted mean (EAM) concentrations were seen among high income country participants with mothers from high income countries than among low/lower-middle income country participants with mothers from the same category. Menstruating females had lower lin-PFOA and br-PFOS EAM concentrations than those who were not. Iron status (plasma ferritin) among females may be a marker of intensity of menstrual bleeding, but it was not significantly associated with legacy PFAS concentrations among females. Further studies are needed to determine how physiological changes occurring around menstruation affect the toxicokinetics of PFAS in females.

The highest levels of OBS were observed in blood (mean/median: 144/133 ng/ml) with the mean tissue/blood ratios (TBRs) consistently below 1, ranging from 0.090 (muscle) to 0.644 (liver).

The calculated tissue-specific LogBAF values, except for muscle, 3.78 (gill)–4.14 (blood) over the regulatory bioaccumulation criterion (Log value: 3.70) indicated its obvious bioaccumulative potency in crucian carp. Molecular docking with estimated binding energies at −8.5 and −9.0 kcal/mol corroborated the strong interactions of OBS with human serum albumin and liver fatty acid binding protein, even though the binding energies were lower than those of PFOS.

This study is focused on the Pb concentrations and isotope ratios in the particulate matter of the Brazilian city of GoiA cent nia in order to determine the main Pb emission sources. Particulate matter samples were collected on clean Teflon filters during rainy and dry season in 2014 in the center of GoiA cent nia city near main roads with a high traffic volume. Pb concentrations as well as stable Pb isotope ratios of the particulate matter samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. To apply this analytical technique successfully, it was necessary to optimize parameters in case of acquisition time, detector dead time, and mass discrimination, which affect the measurement accuracy and precision. Results showed that Pb concentrations in GoiA cent nia were different between rainy and dry season. Pb concentrations showed higher values and less variation in dry season than in rainy season. Pb isotope ratios demonstrated significant variations between dry and rainy season. An enrichment of Pb-206 isotopes related to Pb-207 and Pb-208 isotopes was observed in dry season. However, the comparison of the obtained isotopic Pb signature with data of potential Pb sources from previous studies indicated that traffic-related sources should be considered as main Pb source in the particulate matter of GoiA cent nia. These assumptions were incorporated by the calculation of the contribution factor of Pb coming from traffic-related sources by applying binary mixing equations.",NA,10.1007/s11356-017-9687-9,Multiple Sclerosis;Intracranial Hypertension,NA,NA

Despite regulatory efforts to phase out legacy PFAS, they remain detectable in drinking water throughout the United States. This is due to the stability of legacy PFAS and the continued use of replacement compounds. In humans, PFAS have been detected in placenta and cord blood and are associated with low birth weight and preeclampsia risk. Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal mortality and is driven by insufficient endometrial trophoblast invasion, resulting in poor placental blood flow. PFAS alter invasion of other cell types, but their impact on trophoblasts is not understood. We therefore assessed the effects of PFAS on trophoblast migration, invasion, and gene expression in vitro. Trophoblast migration and invasion were assessed using a modified scratch assay in the absence or presence of Matrigel, respectively. Treatment with perfluorooctanoic sulfate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and GenX (1000 ng/ml) each decreased trophoblast migration over 24 h. However, only GenX (1000 ng/ml) significantly inhibited trophoblast invasion. Treatment with PFOS, PFOA, and GenX also decreased trophoblast expression of chemokines (eg, CCL2), chemokine receptors (eg, CCR4), and inflammatory enzymes (eg, ALOX15) involved in migration. Inhibition of chemokine receptors with pertussis toxin (10 ng/ml), a G-protein inhibitor, inhibited trophoblast migration similar to the PFAS. Taken together, PFAS decrease trophoblast migration, invasion, and inflammatory signaling. By understanding the mechanisms involved, it may be possible to identify the biological and exposure factors that contribute to preeclampsia.",NA,10.1093/toxsci/kfaa043,character(0),NA,NA

The majority of the studies on PPCPs in wastewaters involve analysis only of representative compounds for each class, while few studies reported for the analysis of several compounds from multiple classes of PPCPs in samples. In this light, the aim of this work was to develop a multiresidue analytical protocol based on solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometer-(LC-MS/MS) for simultaneous determination of 138 substances including 37 different classes of PPCPs that can be used for monitoring in wastewater. Hence, an extensive monitoring survey of PPCPs in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in three cities of North (Thessaloniki) and Central (Larisa, Volos) Greece region has been conducted. In addition, the occurrence of the target compounds in raw waters of effluents from two medium-size hospitals located in the Larisa Region was investigated. Analgesics-anti-inflammatories (paracetamol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, salicylic acid), diuretic (furosemide), antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, clarithromycin, azithromycin), anti-hypertensives (valsartan, irbesartan, telmisartan), psychiatric drugs (carbamazepine, venlafaxine, citalopram), stimulant (caffeine) and beta blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol) were among the most frequently detected compounds. The removal rates varied between the different therapeutic groups, as well within each therapeutic group, important variations in removal were observed, going from not eliminated to 100%. Mass loading distribution in the different WWTPs was also evaluated. Finally, the risk quotient approach (RQ) for single substances and the cumulative RQ for the classes of the target PPCPs was used in order to identify the potential ecotoxicological risk posed in the tree trophic levels of aquatic organisms.

The main exposure route for these substances is diet but comparative studies on how dietary habits influence exposure are lacking. Objectives: To examine the relations between blood levels of PFAS and adherence to three predefined dietary patterns (a WHO recommended diet, a Mediterranean-like diet, and a Low-Carbohydrate High-Protein (LCHP) diet) in an elderly Swedish population. Methods: Dietary data from 7-day food records and serum concentrations of PFAS were obtained from a 70-year-old Swedish population (n=844), the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study. The Healthy Diet Indicator score (based on WHO recommendations), the Mediterranean Diet Score and LCHP score were used to assess adherence. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the associations between eight major PFAS and adherence to each dietary pattern. Results: The WHO recommended diet was positively associated with perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS). The LCHP diet was positively related to four out of eight PFAS; namely, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). The Mediterranean-like diet was positively associated with most PFAS; namely perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUnDA. Conclusions: All dietary patterns were positively associated with blood levels of PFAS. The highest body burden of PFAS was found in individuals with high adherence to a Mediterranean-like diet, whilst individuals who more closely followed the officially recommended diet displayed a lower body burden of these compounds. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2016.05.016,Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Sweden;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;unclassified drug;dietary intake;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;alkyl group;diet;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;pollution exposure;perfluoroalkyl substance;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;blood level;human;serum;aged;Aged;very elderly;epidemiology;major clinical study;priority journal;blood;perfluorononanoic acid;cholesterol blood level;glucose blood level;triacylglycerol blood level;glucose;analysis;Diet;organic pollutant;caloric intake;protein intake;health risk;body condition;body burden;organic compound;statistical model;Cross-Sectional Studies;cross-sectional study;cholesterol;Linear Models;triacylglycerol;prospective study;Prospective Studies;multivariate analysis;Multivariate Analysis;nutritional assessment;waist circumference;high density lipoprotein cholesterol;systolic blood pressure;elderly population;low density lipoprotein cholesterol;80;over;Mediterranean;Epidemiology;multiple regression;Carbohydrate-Restricted;Dietary patterns;Dietary Proteins;Elderly;low carbohydrate diet;Low Carbohydrate High dietary score;Mediterranean diet;Mediterranean Diet Score;protein diet;Uppsala [Sweden];Cesarean Section,NA,NA

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a ubiquitous compound of a particular concern in Europe. PFOS can reach high concentrations in tissues of organisms and many toxic effects have been reported in fish. This study aimed at evaluating the toxicological effects of PFOS in European eel peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at the protein expression level. To identify proteins whose expression was modified by PFOS, we performed a proteomic analysis on the post-nuclear fraction of PBMCs after a chronic exposure (28. days) of yellow eels to zero, 1 or 10. μg/L PFOS. This in vivo study was completed by a proteomic field study on eels sampled in Belgian rivers presenting different PFOS pollution degrees. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) to compare the post-nuclear fraction of PBMCs from the reference group with cells from fish exposed to the pollutant of interest. On the 28 spots that were significantly (p. <. 0.05; ANOVA followed by a Dunnett post-hoc test) affected by PFOS in the in vivo experiment, a total of 17 different proteins were identified using nano-LC ESI-MS/MS and the Peptide and Protein Prophet of Scaffold software. In the field experiment, 18 significantly (p. <. 0.05; ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test) affected spots conducted to the identification of 16 different proteins. Interestingly, only three proteins were found in common between in vivo and in situ experiments: plastin-2, alpha-enolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Comparing the results with a previous study, plastin-2 and alpha-enolase were also been found to be affected after in vitro exposure of PBMCs during 48. h to either 10. μg or 1. mg. PFOS/L. Potential use of these proteins as biomarkers of PFOS exposure in European eel could indicate early warning signals. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.110,Biochemistry;Fish;Pollution;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Rivers;effluent;PFOS;Animals;Europe;Leukocytes;Chromatography;Biological Markers;Belgium;female;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;biomarker;in vivo study;protein;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Electrophoresis;mass spectrometry;article;ecotoxicology;priority journal;protein analysis;protein expression;river;glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase;Membrane Glycoproteins;Sewage;River pollution;Population statistics;Gene Expression Regulation;Proteins;population decline;Analysis of Variance;Experiments;Proteomics;long term exposure;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;Molecular biology;proteomics;Liquid;Gel;Anguilla anguilla;eel;Analysis of variance (ANOVA);Software testing;2D-DIGE;Mononuclear;PBMC;peripheral blood mononuclear cell;2D DIGE;Eels;Microfilament Proteins;Phosphopyruvate Hydratase;Scaffolds (biology);two dimensional gel electrophoresis;Two-Dimensional;Sulfones,NA,NA

In order to achieve this objective the optimization of an ultrasonic probe-assisted extraction (UPAE) method was carried out before the analysis of the target compounds by liquid-chromatography-triple quadrupole-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS/MS). 7 mL of 1 % acetic acid in methanol and a 2.5-min single extraction cycle were sufficient for the extraction of all the target analytes. The optimized analytical method was validated in terms of recovery, precision and method detection limits (MDLs). Apparent recovery values after correction with the corresponding labeled standard were in the 69-103 % and 62-98 % range for samples fortified at 25 ng/g and 50 ng/g concentration levels, respectively and MDL values in the 0.6-2.2 ng/g range were obtained.

The SEM, FT-IR, TGA and XPS analysis indicated that the modifier nylon-6 was successfully adsorbed on the surface of raw cellulose paper. The solution pH had little effect on PFASs extraction by nylon-modified cellulose paper, and the recoveries of the nine targeted PFASs had a maximum at pH 5.0. Adsorption experiments showed that nylon-modified cellulose paper can adsorb the PFAS targets mainly by a combination of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobicity. The recoveries of PFASs extracted by nylon-modified cellulose paper in real water samples such as groundwater and wastewater under external standard method conditions ranged from 54.5% to 90.5%. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were in the range of 0.05–1.85 ng/L.

Most work has focused on characterizing dangers to humans, and the effects of PFAS on the environment are under-studied. PFAS contamination of surface water can result in bioaccumulation and biomagnification in fishes. Studies have linked PFAS to lower fitness in fishes, and anglers who consume wild fish can have higher exposure to PFAS compared to the general population. These chemicals remain largely unregulated and the public has been unaware of the extent of contamination and their risk to human health until recently.

Differences in total mercury (THg) concentrations in surface water between dry and wet seasons were insignificant, which was also the case with surface sediment THg levels. Large variations in Hg isotopic compositions were observed both in surface water (delta Hg-202: - 1.53 to 0.61 parts per thousand; Delta Hg-199: - 0.22 to 0.20 parts per thousand) and surface sediment (delta Hg-202: - 2.64 to - 0.96 parts per thousand; Delta Hg-199: - 0.27 to 0.25 parts per thousand). Concentration correlations between mercury and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) implied that mercury in surface sediment may undergo resuspension and be re-emitted to the water surface. The negative Delta Hg-199 in most of the surface sediments and the correlation between mercury and DIN in the wet season indicate that soil erosion is the major source of mercury. The main sources of mercury in surface water are precipitation and natural soil. The correlation between mercury and dissolved inorganic carbon, perfluoroalkyl substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and dissolved Cd indicates that the contribution of underground water and industrial and urban waste cannot be ignored, which is supported by the positive signature of Delta Hg-199. The results of the isotopic analysis also indicate that atmospheric dry deposition is another source of mercury in surface water.

The proposed MD comprises cascaded metalenses, which can invoke polarization-selective transmission phases. The MD which emulates a set of convex and concave lenses renders positively increased beam deflection, whereas the case corresponding to a pair of convex lenses facilitates negatively amplified beam deflection. The essential phase profiles required for embodying the MD are efficiently extracted from its geometric lens counterpart. Furthermore, the implemented FTS, operating in the vicinity of a 1550 nm wavelength, can successfully enable enhanced beam steering by facilitating polarization-sensitive bidirectional deflection amplifications.

This is because food is a vulnerable media for contamination by thousands of biological, chemical and physical agents, and radio nuclear materials. Such contamination may occur intentionally or unintentionally far of ""intended crime."" On the other side, food may deliberately contaminate within ""intended terroristic crime."" Food and water contamination remains the easiest way to distribute toxic agents for the purpose of terrorism. Intentional contamination of food and water supplies by such harmful agents for terrorist purpose is a real and current threat to consumer's health. This presentation addresses the chemical contamination of foods. Unlike most microbiological agents, chemical contaminants present in foods are often unaffected by thermal processing. They can be classified according to the source of contamination and the mechanism by which they enter the food product. They include a wide range of agrochemicals used in agricultural practices and animal husbandry with the intent to increase crops and reduce costs. Such agents include pesticides (e.g. insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides), plant growth regulators, veterinary drugs (e.g. nitrofuran, fluoroquinolones, malachite green, chloramphenicol), and bovine somatotropin (rBST). Moreover, food can be contaminated by chemicals that are present in the environment in which the food is grown, harvested, transported, stored, packaged, processed, and consumed. Possible contaminants include radio nuclides (e.g., cesium, strontium), heavy metals (e.g., arsenic, mercury, cadmium, copper), persistent organic pollutants, [e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), acrylamide, furan, perchlorate], as well as numerous substances attributed to packaging materials [e.g., antimony, tin, lead, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), semicarbazide, benzophenone, isopropylthioxanthone (ITX), bisphenol-A]. At present, melamine represents one of the largest deliberate food contaminant. Increasing incidences of cancer, chronic kidney diseases, suppression of the immune system, sterility among males and females, endocrine disorders, neurological and behavioral disorders, especially among children, have been attributed to chronic exposure to toxic chemicals and/or long-term consumption of food contaminated with such chemicals. Chronic exposure to food chemical contaminants may adversely affect human health even at contamination levels below MRLs (maximum residue limits) of each chemical. Furthermore, exposure through food to different contaminants may lead to additive or synergistic effects, a matter which poses an urgent need to improve our knowledge on such possible interactions at the intestinal level. Sophisticated analytical tools needed for detection of some chemical compounds, such as dioxins and nanoparticle materials, are not available in many countries, a matter which requires assisting these countries to raise their capacity building in this concern. On the other side, there is an urgent need for establishing a Security Plan Development (SPD) which can be realized easily and efficiently by implementing the principles of hazard analyses and critical control points (HACCP). In conclusion, although unintentional contamination of food could be controlled by local regulations, intentional contamination for the purpose of ""terrorism"" should be faced internationally and early as soon as multinational consequences are expected. Coordination between food-safety authorities worldwide is needed to efficiently exchange information and to enable tracking and recalling of affected products to ensure food safety and to protect public health. Cooperation between countries has to be activated and exchanging information is something very important to minimize threat and contamination on national, regional and international levels.

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) were predominant in the coastal water of the South Yellow Sea with a relatively higher level than other coastal regions in the world.

Here, for an efficient control of emerging environmental risks in groundwater, we systematically studied the source apportionment, spatial attenuation, composition change and risk zoning of 12 PFAAs and five novel alternatives within a region of 200 km2 around a mega fluorochemical industrial park (FIP) along the Yangtze River, and in-depth explored potential association between groundwater and soil pollution as well as influencing factors on contaminant migration and risk distribution in the aquifer. Short-chain PFAAs and novel alternatives together accounted for over 70% in groundwater, revealing their prevalence in replacing legacy perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Novel alternatives for PFOA were mainly hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) and hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA), while those for PFOS were 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS). PFAAs (maximum total: 1339 ng/L) and novel alternatives (maximum total: 208 ng/L) in groundwater were mostly derived from the FIP, and exhibited an exponentially decreasing trend with increasing distance. Compared with those in groundwater, more diverse sources of PFAAs and novel alternatives in surface soil were identified. The transport of these chemicals may be retarded by clayed surface soils with high organic matter contents. High aquifer permeability could generally promote the dilution and migration of PFAAs and novel alternatives in groundwater, as well as reduce the differences in their spatial distribution. Shorter-chain components with smaller molecules and higher hydrophilicity exhibited greater migration capacities in the aquifer. In addition, different levels of health risk from PFOS and PFOA were zoned based on drinking groundwater, and high risks tended to be distributed in areas with relatively poor aquifer water yield due to higher pollutant accumulation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154413,Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Rivers;PFAAs;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;concentration (parameter);fluorocarbon;perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;environmental monitoring;alkyl group;Health risks;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;chlorination;concentration (composition);alkanesulfonic acid;migration;source apportionment;surfactant;risk assessment;Risk assessment;Risks assessments;Dimers;hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid;oxide;Oxides;organic matter;soil;drinking water;Potable water;Soil;soil pollution;Soils;Organic chemicals;Soil pollution;health hazard;surface soil;river;ground water;Groundwater;Groundwater pollution;chemical industry;chemical structure;prevalence;health risk;hydrophilicity;River pollution;spatial analysis;molecular analysis;aquifer;Aquifers;Groundwater resources;dilution;environmental risk;Molecular structure;Water Pollutants;Fluorochemicals;Chemical;Environmental risks;Yangtze River;fluorotelomer sulfonic acid;hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid;propylene oxide;Aquifer water;Aquifer water yield;chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid;Fluorinated substitute;Fluorinated substitutes;groundwater resource;sulfone;water transport;Water yield,NA,NA

Wheat plants were grown in the spiked-PFCA hydroponic culture system at different salinities and temperatures. As expected, salinity and temperature significantly impacted the root uptake and translocation of wheat to four PFCAs, and the concentrations for each of PFCAs in wheat root and shoot increased with increasing salinity and temperature, respectively. PFCA concentrations at high salinity or high temperature were up to thrice those found at low salinity or low temperature. Except for perfluorobutanoic acid, the amount of PFCAs in root was always higher than that in shoot at the ranges of salinity and temperature tested.

BDE47/Sigma-PBDE was higher in the seals from Svalbard compared to that for Baltic seals, while the trend was opposite for BDE153 and 154. The geographical difference in contaminant pattern of PBDEs in ringed seals could be explained by biotransformation via oxidative metabolism and/or by dietary differences. OH-PBDEs were detectable in the majority of plasma samples from both locations, and dominated by bioaccumulation of naturally occurring congeners. Low levels of 3-OH-BDE47 and 4'-OH-BDE49 in the Baltic ringed seals suggested minor oxidative biotransformation of BDE47. In the Baltic seals, BDE153/Sigma-PBDEs and BDE154/Sigma-PBDEs increased and BDE28/Sigma-PBDE decreased with increasing Sigma-POP concentration, which suggests BDE153 and 154 are more persistent than BDE28.

To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated the association between concentrations of perflurooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and their sum (∑4PFAAs) in DW and serum in Swedish adolescents using weighted least squares regression. We paired serum PFAA concentrations in adolescents (age 10–21 years, n = 790) from the dietary survey Riksmaten Adolescents 2016–17 (RMA) with mean PFAA concentrations in water samples collected in 2018 from waterworks (n = 45) supplying DW to the participant residential and school addresses. The median concentrations of individual PFAAs in DW were < 1 ng/L. Median concentrations of PFNA and PFHxS in serum were < 1 ng/g, while those of PFOA and PFOS were 1–2 ng/g. Significant positive associations between PFAA concentrations in DW and serum were found for all four PFAAs and ∑4PFAAs, with estimated serum/DW concentration ratios ranging from 210 (PFOA) to 670 (PFHxS), taking exposure from sources other than DW (background) into consideration. The mean concentrations of PFHxS and ∑4PFAA in DW that would likely cause substantially elevated serum concentrations above background variation were estimated to 0.9 ng/L and 2.4 ng/L, respectively. The European Food Safety Authority has determined a health concern concentration of 6.9 ng ∑4PFAAs/mL serum. This level was to a large degree exceeded by RMA participants with DW ∑4PFAA concentrations above the maximum limits implemented in Denmark (2 ng ∑4PFAAs/L) and Sweden (4 ng ∑4PFAAs/L) than by RMA participants with DW concentrations below the maximum limits.

The present survey was conducted in the Gironde estuary (southwestern France) where PFASs were ubiquitously detected albeit at low levels. Emerging PFASs such as fluorotelomer sulfonates or polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diesters accounted for a relatively minor proportion of ΣPFASs, while perfluorooctanesulfonate, perfluorohexanesulfonate, and perfluorohexanoate were the predominant congeners. Multiple linear regressions provided insights into the relative influence of factors controlling PFAS sediment levels. In that respect, the organic carbon fraction (strongly correlated to sediment grain size) appeared as a more important controlling factor than black carbon or distance from upstream sources for long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids. In the maximum turbidity zone (suspended solids up to 2600 mg L-1), the particle-associated fraction was almost consistently >50% for long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and sulfonates (≥C8 and ≥ C6, respectively). Empirical models of KD partitioning coefficients were derived by integrating, for the first time, both particle-concentration and salting-out effects. These results represent significant progress toward the development of numerical transport models integrating both PFAS partitioning and 3D-hydrosedimentary dynamics, with a view to estimate PFAS mass budgets at the land-sea interface. © XXXX American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.7b03626,Fluorocarbons;Article;Carboxylation;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Carboxylic Acids;France;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;environmental monitoring;alkyl group;organophosphate;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;chemical compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;carboxylic acid;polyfluoroalkyl substance;chemical analysis;sodium chloride;sediment;Estuaries;estuary;coastal waters;environmental impact;concentration process;organic carbon;Organic carbon;physical chemistry;environmental factor;water quality;river discharge;salinity;partitioning;Salinity;hydrology;coastal water;Environmental factors;iron oxide;Multiple linear regressions;Partitioning coefficients;Organic carbon fraction;Discharge (fluid mechanics);black carbon;Budget control;Gironde Estuary;land-sea interaction;Numerical transport model;organic nitrogen;Particle concentrations;turbidity,NA,NA

The goal of the present study was, therefore, to experimentally determine the bioaccumulation of fully ionized compounds and to identify screening parameters that can indicate high bioaccumulation potential of IOCs. Three feeding studies with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were carried out according to OECD TG 305. Separation of liver, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and carcass allowed to further elucidate the tissue distribution of the individual test substances. The chemicals chosen had characteristics that made them suspect for high bioaccumulation, and included two cations (tetrabutylphosphonium bromide (TBP), trimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride (TMOA)) and four anions (benzotriazole, tecloftalam, pentachlorophenol (PCP), MEE-phosphonate). Data on the dietary biomagnification of IOCs (strong acids) were also collected from published literature. Results The highest distribution factors were found for the GIT, followed by liver. However, none of the tested IOCs showed a distinct biomagnification potential, as kinetic biomagnification factors (BMFk) ranged between 0.001 and 0.05 g/g (median 0.009 g/g). Cations showed lower assimilation efficiency (alpha) than anions, except for tecloftalam. In contrast, anions showed a considerably faster depuration rate (half-life less than 0.5 days) compared to cations (half-life of around 5 days). Sixteen potential screening parameters for BMF were calculated with a chemical property estimation tool (ACD/i-Lab) and correlated with the BMF data from this study and from literature. The number of hydrogen bond donors (nHBD) showed the highest correlation to measured BMF, but the prediction is only based on two values (one or two nHBD), while the other descriptors were insignificantly correlated. Conclusion The suspected dietary bioaccumulation potential of the six IOCs could not be confirmed in the feeding studies with rainbow trout. The more than twenty screening parameters showed no particularly high correlation neither with the test results nor with the BMF values collected from literature. The results corroborate earlier findings that ionization lowers the tendency of a chemical for dietary bioaccumulation, compared to non-ionized chemicals. In addition to the lipophobicity of ionic molecule moieties, fast depuration seems to be a major reason for the observed low dietary bioaccumulation of ionic compounds, in particular anions. Fast depuration may happen due to rapid metabolism of charged compounds, and future studies should test this hypothesis.",NA,10.1186/s12302-020-00443-1,character(0),NA,NA

While PCBs dominated the composition of these contaminants in loons at all sites (Sigma PCBs > p,p'-DDE> Sigma PBDEs > Sigma Chlordanes > HCB), p,p'-DDE and Sigma PBDEs were also important, averaging approximately 50% and 20% of total PCB concentrations, respectively. Sigma PCBs and Sigma PBDEs were higher in males than in females. Inter-lake variation was apparent for contaminant concentrations and patterns and were largely explained by dietary signatures (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and proximity to a large hydroelectric dam.

In the last three decades, this led to different regulatory restrictions for specific PFAS as well as shifts in the production and usage of these substances. In this study, we analyzed the PFAS levels of 100 human blood plasma samples collected from 2009 to 2019 for the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB) to further elucidate the time course of exposure towards this substance group as shown by Schröter-Kermani et al., (2013) with samples from 1982 to 2010. A spectrum of 37 PFAS, including perfluorocarboxylic (PFCA) and –sulfonic acids (PFSA) as well as potential precursors and substitutes like ADONA, GenX or F-53B was analyzed by UHPLC coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Validation was successful for 33 of the substances. The two legacy substances perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were detected in every sample of the 2009–2019 dataset and showed the highest concentrations with ranges of 0.27–14.0 ng/mL and 1.21–14.1 ng/mL, respectively. A significant portion of total PFOS analytes was present as branched isomers (mean: 34 ± 7%). High detection frequencies of 95% and 82% were also found for perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), respectively, but in lower concentrations (PFHxS: <LOQ – 4.62 ng/mL; PFNA: <LOQ – 3.66 ng/mL) than PFOA and PFOS. Besides other PFCA and PFSA only 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (8:2 FtS) and N-methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid were detected in very few samples. In combination with the previous results from 1982 to 2010, declining temporal trends were observed for all PFAS (PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, and PFOS) frequently detected in the ESB samples.

The occurrence of 78 pharmaceuticals belonging to several therapeutic classes was assessed in hospital effluents and WWTP wastewaters (influent and effluent) as well as the contribution of each hospital in WWTP influent in terms of pharmaceutical load. Results indicate that pharmaceuticals are widespread pollutants in both hospital and urban wastewaters. The contribution of hospitals to the input of pharmaceuticals in urban wastewaters widely varies, according to their dimension. The estimated total mass loadings were 306 g d(-1) for the university hospital, 155 g d(-1) for the general one, 14 g d(-1) for the pediatric hospital and 1.5 g d(-1) for the maternity hospital, showing that the biggest hospitals have a greater contribution to the total mass load of pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, analysis of individual contributions of each therapeutic group showed that NSAIDs, analgesics and antibiotics are among the groups with the highest inputs. Removal efficiency can go from over 90% for pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen and ibuprofen to not removal for beta-blockers and salbutamol. Total mass load of pharmaceuticals into receiving surface waters was estimated between 5 and 14 g/d/1000 inhabitants. Finally, the environmental risk posed by pharmaceuticals detected in hospital and WWTP effluents was assessed by means of hazard quotients toward different trophic levels (algae, daphnids and fish). Several pharmaceuticals present in the different matrices were identified as potentially hazardous to aquatic organisms, showing that especial attention should be paid to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin and clarithromycin, since their hazard quotients in WWTP effluent revealed that they could pose an ecotoxicological risk to algae.

Few studies have been conducted, and the environmental effects of CBs on marine species are still poorly understood. This study aims to evaluate the ecotoxicological effects on marine organisms of both classic and electronic CBs. Three representative species of different trophic levels in marine ecosystems (Aliivibrio fischeri, bacteria; Phaeodactylum tricornutum, algae, primary producers; Paracentrotus lividus, echinoderms, consumers) were tested. The effects of natural ageing of CBs due to exposure to atmospheric conditions (natural sunlight vs. simulated rain) and for different times (1 vs. 2 weeks) were evaluated. The results were weighted together to obtain a synthetic hazard level to the environment (Class of Hazard) from Sediqualsoft (R). Classic CBs (CCBs) performed the worst and posed a mild to moderate risk compared to electronic CBs (absent Class of Hazard). Smoked classic CBs posed a higher environmental risk than unsmoked. The highest risk was produced by classic CBs after one week of exposure in dry weather. Echinoderms and the body size reduction in normo-formed (72 h) plutei were shown to be the more sensitive organism and endpoint, respectively. We recommend the use of Sediqualsoft (R) software for risk assessment studies of sediments contaminated with contaminants of various types, especially in conjunction with a weight of evidence approach (WOE).",NA,10.3390/jmse9070734,Military Personnel,NA,NA

Metabolism of diSPAP was investigated in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) after exposure in water for 10 days, followed by 10 days of depuration. Branched isomers of diSPAP (B-diSPAP) were preferentially enriched in medaka exposed to diSPAP, with the proportion of branched isomers (BF) ranging from 0.56 to 0.80, which was significantly greater than that in the water to which the medaka were exposed (0.36) (p < 0.001). This enrichment was due primarily to preferential uptake of B-diSPAP. PFOS together with perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamide (NEtFOSA), 2-(perfluorooctanesulfonamido)acetic acid (FOSAA), NEtFOSAA, FOSE, and NEtFOSE were detected in medaka exposed to diSPAP, which indicated the potential for biotransformation of diSPAP to PFOS via multiple intermediates. Due to preferential metabolism of branched isomers, FOSAA and PFOSA exhibited greater BF values (>0.5) than those of NEtFOSA, NEtFOSAA, and NEtFOSE (<0.2). Such preferential metabolism of branched isomers along the primary pathway of metabolism and preferential accumulation of B-diSPAP led to enrichment of branched PFOS (B-PFOS) in medaka. Enrichment of B-PFOS was greater for 3-, 4-, and 5-perfluoromethyl PFOS (P3MPFOS, P4MPFOS, and P5MPFOS), for which values of BF were 0.58 ± 0.07, 0.62 ± 0.06, and 0.61 ± 0.05 (day 6), respectively; these values are 5.8-, 7.8-, and 6.4-fold greater than those of technical PFOS.

Still, our knowledge about spatial distribution, temporal changes and ecotoxicological fate of metals and organic contaminants in wildlife is limited. We studied concentrations of 69 elements and 50 organic compounds in 300 bank voles (Myodes glareolus), Europe's most common mammal, sampled in spring and autumn 2017-2018 in five monitoring areas, representing three biogeographic regions. In addition, we compared measured concentrations with previous results from bank voles sampled within the same areas in 1995-1997 and 2001. In general, our results show regional differences, but no consistent patterns among contaminants and study areas. The exception was for the lowest concentrations of organic contaminants (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFOS), which were generally found in the northern Swedish mountain area Concentrations of metals and organic contaminants in adults varied seasonally with most organic contaminants being higher in spring; likely induced by diet shifts but potentially also related to age differences. In addition, metal concentrations varied between organs (liver vs. kidney), age classes (juveniles vs. adults; generally higher in adults) as well as between males and females. Concentrations of chromium and nickel in kidney and liver in the northernmost mountain area were lower in 2017-2018 than in 1995-1997 and in three of four areas, lead concentrations were lower in 2017-2018 than in 2001. Current metal concentrations (except mercury) are not expected to negatively affect the voles. Concentrations of hexachlorobenzene displayed highest concentrations in 2001 in the mountains, while it was close to detection limit in 2017-2018. Likewise, PFOS concentrations decreased in the mountains and in south-central lowland forests between 2001 and 2017-2018.

Plasma collected from live-captured white whales from two time periods (2013–2014, n = 9, and 1996–2001, n = 11) were analysed for 19 different PFASs. The 11 PFASs detected included seven C8–C14 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) and three C6–C8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) as well as perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA). Recent plasma concentrations (2013–2014) of the dominant PFAS in white whales, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; geometric mean = 22.8 ng/mL), was close to an order of magnitude lower than reported in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Svalbard. PFOS concentrations in white whales were about half the concentrations in harbour (Phoca vitulina) and ringed (Pusa hispida) seals, similar to hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) and higher than in walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) from that same area. From 1996 to 2001 to 2013–2014, plasma concentrations of PFOS decreased by 44%, whereas four C9-12 PFCAs and total PFCAs increased by 35–141%. These results follow a similar trend to what has been reported in other studies of Arctic marine mammals from Svalbard. The most dramatic change has been the decline of PFOS concentrations since 2000, corresponding to the production phase-out of PFOS and related compounds in many countries around the year 2000 and a global restriction on these substances in 2009. Still, the continued dominance of PFOS in white whales, and increasing concentration trends for several PFCAs, even though exposure is relatively low, calls for continued monitoring of concentrations of both PFCAs and PFSAs and investigation of biological effects. © 2020 The Authors; Short quote: Perfluoroalkyl substances have been measured in white whales from Svalbard sampled 15 years apart.

Top predators, including seabirds, are effective monitors of POPs because they forage over a range of marine habitats, integrating signals over space and time. However, migration patterns can make unravelling contaminant sources, and potentially assessments of the effectiveness of regulations, challenging if chemicals are acquired at distant sites. In 2014, we fitted geolocators on ancient murrelets (Synthliboramphus antiqueus) at four colonies on the Pacific Coast of Canada to obtain movement data throughout an annual cycle. All birds underwent a post-breeding moult in the Bering Sea. Around one-third then returned to overwinter on the British Columbia (BC) coast while the rest migrated to overwinter in waters along the north Asian coast. Such a stark difference in migration destination provided an opportunity to examine the influence of wintering location on contaminant signals. In summer 2015, we collected blood samples from returned geo-tagged birds and analyzed them for a suite of contaminants, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), non-PBDE halogenated flame retardants, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organochlorines, and mercury. Feathers were also collected and analyzed for stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta(34)5). We found no significant differences in blood concentrations of any contaminant between murrelets from the two different overwinter areas, a result that indicates relatively rapid clearance of POPs accumulated during winter. Spatial variation in diet (i.e., delta C-13) was associated with both BDE-47 and -99 concentrations. However, individual variation in trophic level had little influence on concentrations of any other examined contaminants. Thus, blood from these murrelets is a good indicator of recent, local contaminants, as most signals appear independent of overwintering location. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Among them, several long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids bioaccumulate in aquatic vertebrates, but our understanding of the mechanisms of absorption, distribution and elimination is still limited in fish. For this purpose, we developed a 10-compartment physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model to elucidate perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) kinetics in adult rainbow trout. This PBTK model included various physiological characteristics: blood perfusion to each organ, plasmatic fraction, PFOS free fraction, and growth of individuals. The parameters were optimized using Bayesian inferences. First, only PFOS absorption by diet was considered in the model as well as its elimination by urine, bile and feces. Then two mechanistic hypotheses, assumed to govern PFOS toxicokinetics in fish, namely the enterohepatic cycle and the absorption and elimination though gills, were tested. Improvement of the model's fit to the data was studied in each organ by comparing predictions with observed data using relative error. The experimental data set was obtained from an exposure experiment, where adult rainbow trout were fed with a PFOS-spiked diet for 42 days, followed by a 35-day depuration period. In all cases, PFOS concentrations were accurately predicted in organs and feces by the model. The results of this PBTK model demonstrated that feces represented the major elimination route for PFOS while urine was a minor route. Also, PFOS branchial uptake can be substantial despite low concentrations of the compound in water, and elimination through gills should not be neglected. Finally, the enterohepatic cycle is likely to play a minor role in PFOS toxicokinetics. Overall, this PBTK model accurately described PFOS distribution in rainbow trout and provides information on the relative contribution of absorption and elimination pathways. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.105,Physiology;Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;animal;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;bioaccumulation;animal tissue;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);adult;alkanesulfonic acid;sulfonate;priority journal;tissue distribution;toxicokinetics;metabolism;Oncorhynchus mykiss;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;physiology;Toxicokinetics;Vertebrata;absorption;biological uptake;analytical parameters;Body fluids;pollution transport;Physiological models;Perfluorooctanoate;Alkanesulfonates;salmonid;Water Pollutants;body growth;feces level;Chemical;Bayes theorem;gill;compartment model;Rainbow trout;enterohepatic circulation;physiologically based toxicokinetic model;Bayesian networks;bile flow;Elimination route contribution;modeling;Multi-compartment models;Perfluorooctanoate sulfonate;Physiological multicompartment model;plasmatic fraction;Simultaneous uptake pathway;tissue perfusion;Uptake pathways;urinary excretion;Sulfones,NA,NA

Many of these contaminants have been found to have ill effects over wildlife and humans. Birds are known to be particularly affected through endocrine disruption and eggshell thinning. POPs have been banned or restricted through the Stockholm Convention (2001), making monitoring essential for tracking effects of regulation. Seabirds have been used as monitoring tools for being top predators and consuming a diverse array of prey in different trophic levels. Non-destructive sampling has become widely popular using feathers and preen oil, as opposed to carcasses and internal organs. This study aimed to set baseline levels of POP and PAH concentration in a highly pelagic and abundant seabird in Ireland and the Atlantic, the European storm petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus, and to investigate the profiles of contaminant congeners in preen oil and feathers, comparatively. Mean concentrations in preen oil followed: PCB (10.1 ng/g ww) > PAH (7.1 ng/g ww) > OCP (5.4 ng/g ww) > PBDE (3.9 ng/g ww), whilst mean concentrations in feathers followed the order: PAH (38.9 ng/g ww) > PCB (27.2 ng/g ww) > OCP (17.9 ng/g ww) > PBDE (4.5 ng/g ww). Congener profiles highly differed between preen oil and feathers, and little correlation was found between the matrices.

Based on systematic monitoring of PFASs at 43 hydrologic stations along a 4300 km continuum of the Yangtze River, we investigated the ecological risk of PFASs under changing exposure resulting from operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). Importantly, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was found extensively exposed in most mainstream water samples, accounting for about 90% of the total content of PFASs in both spring and autumn, while short-chain PFASs contributed more than PFOA in sediment. The significant inversion of long-chain PFASs occurrence from sediment to water reflected a profound change in exposure due to loss of finer sediments resulting from long-distance and long-term scour of the riverbed downstream of the TGD. The coarsening of bed materials would weaken sorption of long-chain PFASs in sediments and enhance their exposure in water, resulting in substantial increase of ecological risk to representative aquatic organisms. In the long term, particular attention should be paid to reduction of PFOA discharge to downstream of the TGD from typical industries. This also highlights the significance of huge dams to alternative exposures of persistent organic pollutants and the necessity of new strategy for ecological risk management of large river systems. © 2020",NA,10.1016/j.watres.2020.115933,Fluorocarbons;Rivers;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;China;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;controlled study;ecotoxicity;Organic pollutants;environmental monitoring;alkyl group;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;chemical compound;Perfluorooctanoic acid;river water;priority journal;sediment;river;organic pollutant;dam (barrier);Geologic Sediments;Sediments;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);spring;season;seasonal variation;Seasons;environmental risk;aquatic organism;Aquatic organisms;river system;Ecological risks;Water Pollutants;Risk management;Chemical;river discharge;Yangtze River;Ecological risk;sediment-water interface;autumn;Hubei;Changing exposure;Coarsening;Hydrologic stations;Large river system;Potential ecological risk;scour;Scour;Three Gorges Dam,NA,NA

Many previous studies have performed data-dependent acquisition (DDA) of mass spectra from an environmental sample by high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify PFAS suspects individually. In comparison, the data-independent acquisition (DIA) of comprehensive mass spectra of the sample is a technology which enables to know the occurrences of suspects and non-targets simultaneously. However, it is difficult to associate the fragment ions of targeted precursor ions by retention time only, because of the existence of co-eluting ions derived from environmental samples. Since the separation of ions is not enough with only the conventional DIA method, here, we attempted to support it using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMS) to distinguish the relevant ions from co-eluting ions by drift time. Firstly, suspect screening of PFASs with eternal database resulted in determining 32–96 PFAS suspects in firefighting foam impacted groundwater samples (n = 8) by suspect screening. Among all the pairs of respective precursor ions and fragment ions of the PFAS suspects, 5%–19% (4–9 PFASs) of them were associated without considering the drift time of IMS, while 37%–49% (15–43 PFASs) of them were associated with considering the drift time. The consideration of the drift time increased the association ratios in all samples. In a sample, most precursor ions could be associated with their fragment ions (41 of 43 PFASs) because at least one probable fragment ion was observed among three of maximum intensity fragment ions. Thus, the method improved the identification by excluding the unrelated co-eluting ions by IMS. Moreover, the method can acquire a certain reliable MS/MS spectra of suspects in environmental samples in one analysis. It is not essential to conduct instrumental analyses again for samples stored for a long time even when the data sets and/or methodologies of data analyses are modified (e.g., the original database, screening list, or statistical filtering/data cleaning approach). It will be particularly useful for studies that must analyze a large number of environmental samples. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.chroma.2021.461899,Fluorocarbons;Article;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;chemistry;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;liquid chromatography;procedures;solid phase extraction;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;water sampling;organofluorine derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;chemical analysis;Ions;molecular weight;ground water;Groundwater;time of flight mass spectrometry;High resolution mass spectrometry;Instrumental analysis;Water Pollutants;Mass spectrometers;Environmental sample;data analysis;electrophoresis;Chemical;information processing;Per-;perfluoropentane sulfonic acid;retention time;Suspect screening;Screening;ion mobility spectrometry;Ion Mobility Spectrometry;polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);Environmental water samples;Computer-Assisted;Data-independent acquisition (DIA);Drift time;image processing;Image Processing;Ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMS);Ion mobility spectrometers;Ion mobility-mass spectrometry;Maximum intensities;perfluoro 1 hexanesulfonamide;perfluoro 1 octanesulfonamide;Statistical filtering;Mass Spectrometry,NA,NA

Previous studies have suggested that several PFASs do not undergo biotransformation due to their chemical stability, yet perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS)- and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)-exposed organisms have presented altered activity of important biotransformation pathways. Given the fundamental role of biotransformation in biological organisms and the significant distribution of PFAS in aquatic environments, the present study investigated the influence of PFOA and PFOS on phase I biotransformation enzymes in vitro using the rainbow trout liver RTL-W1 cell line and in vivo using juvenile rainbow trout. Cells and fish were exposed and co-exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), for 72 h and 10 days, respectively, prior to measurements of cytotoxicity and biotransformation ability through measurements of CYP1A1-, CYP1A2-, and CYP3A4-like activities. Our results indicate that exposure to PFAS-BaP binary mixtures altered CYP1A-like activity in vivo; however, those alterations were not observed in vitro. Similarly, while BaP did not significantly induce CYP3A4 in vivo, exposure to the PFAS led to significantly lower enzymatic activity relative to basal levels. These observations may have implications for organisms simultaneously exposed to PFASs and other environmental pollutants for which biotransformation is necessary, especially in detoxification mechanisms. Furthermore, the interference with biotransformation pathways could potentially predispose exposed organisms to a compromised physiology, which may increase their vulnerability to other stressors and erode their survival fitness. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",NA,10.1007/s10695-022-01093-1,"Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Biotransformation;animal;ecosystem;Ecosystem;fluorocarbon;human;Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA);metabolism;Oncorhynchus mykiss;biotransformation;benzo[a]pyrene;cytochrome P450 3A;In vitro;Rainbow trout;Benzo(a)pyrene;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A;In vivo;Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS);RTL-W1;7,8-Dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene 9,10-oxide;Benzopyrene Hydroxylase",NA,NA

These persistent contaminants are widespread in aquatic ecosystems at low concentrations, possibly exerting long-term toxicity. Larvae of C. riparius of a native population were exposed for 10 generations to 10 μg/L nominal concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, and PFBS, comparable with the maximum values found in European rivers. All treatments showed reduced growth at most/several generations. No effects on survival, development, and reproduction were found. A final tolerance-induction test was performed exposing the pre-exposed experimental cohorts to 100 µg/L PFOS and 150 µg/L PFOA for a whole life cycle. Factorial analysis of variance revealed no difference between treatments (i.e., PFOS vs PFOA), indicating no induced tolerance. Instead, organisms pre-exposed to PFBS were the most stressed, followed by those pre-exposed to PFOA and PFOS, with earlier emergence and reduced adult weight. The results may be related to general stress and genetic erosion induced by long-term laboratory culture, but also to long-term toxicant exposure. However, no effects at the population level (population growth rate) were proved, and thus a toxicity risk in real ecosystems at the tested concentrations seems unlikely.

We investigated the accumulation of PFASs in a marine apex predator, the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Muscle (N = 12) and blood plasma (N = 27) samples were collected from 27 sharks during 2018-2021 OCEARCH expeditions along the eastern coast of North America from Nova Scotia to Florida. Samples were analyzed for 47 (plasma) and 43 (muscle) targeted PFASs and screened for >2600 known and novel PFASs using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Perfluoroalkyl carboxylates with carbon chain-length C11 to C14 were frequently detected above the method reporting limits in plasma samples, along with perfluorooctanesulfonate and perfluorodecanesulfonate. Perfluoropentadecanoate was also detected in 100% of plasma samples and concentrations were estimated semiquantitatively as no analytical standard was available. Total concentrations of frequently detected PFASs in plasma ranged from 0.56 to 2.9 ng mL-1 (median of 1.4 ng mL-1). In muscle tissue, nine targeted PFASs were frequently detected, with total concentration ranging from 0.20 to 0.84 ng g-1 ww. For all frequently detected PFASs, concentrations were greater in plasma than in muscle collected from the same organism. In both matrices, perfluorotridecanoic acid was the most abundant PFAS, consistent with several other studies. PFASs with similar chain-lengths correlated significantly among the plasma samples, suggesting similar sources. Total concentrations of PFASs in plasma were significantly greater in sharks sampled off of Nova Scotia than all sharks from other locations, potentially due to differences in diet. HRMS suspect screening tentatively identified 13 additional PFASs in plasma, though identification confidence was low, as no MS/MS fragmentation was collected due to low intensities. The widespread detection of long-chain PFASs in plasma and muscle of white sharks highlights the prevalence and potential biomagnification of these compounds in marine apex predators. © 2024 The Authors.

Food preparation is known to impact the nutrient and environmental contaminant content of processed items, yet the impacts of preparation on indigenous Arctic MM TFs remain poorly characterized. In order to determine how the various processes involved in preparing beluga blubber TFs affect their levels of nutrients and environmental contaminants, we collected blubber samples from 2 male beluga whales, aged 24 and 37 years, captured during the 2014 summer hunting season in Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, and processed them according to local TF preparation methods. We measured the levels of select nutrients [selenium (Se), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)] and contaminants [organochlorine pesticides, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), mercury (Hg)] in raw and prepared (boiled, roasted, aged) beluga blubber TFs. The impacts of beluga blubber TF preparation methods on nutrient and environmental contaminant levels were inconsistent, as the majority of processes either did not appear to influence concentrations or affected the two belugas differently. However, roasting and ageing beluga blubber consistently impacted certain compounds: roasting blubber increased concentrations of hydrophilic substances (Se and certain PFASs) through solvent depletion and deposited PAHs from cookfire smoke. The solid-liquid phase separation involved in ageing blubber depleted hydrophilic elements (Se, Hg) and some ionogenic PFASs from the lipid-rich liquid oil phase, while PUFA levels appeared to increase, and hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants were retained. Ageing blubber adjacent to in-use smokehouses also resulted in considerable PAH deposition to processed samples. Our findings demonstrated that contaminant concentration differences were greater between the two sets of whale samples, based on age differences, than they were within each set of whale samples, due to variable preparation methods. When considering means to minimize human contaminant exposure while maximizing nutrient intake, consumption of aged liquid from younger male whales would be preferred, based on possible PUFA enhancement and selective depletion of hydrophilic environmental contaminants in this food item. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA,10.1039/c7em00167c,Humans;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Canada;Fatty Acids;Food Contamination;Selenium;animal;Arctic;Arctic Regions;male;Male;food contamination;environmental monitoring;water pollutant;human;meat;analysis;selenium;cooking;Cooking;beluga whale;standards;Water Pollutants;Meat Products;unsaturated fatty acid;Chemical;Unsaturated;Beluga Whale;American Indian;American Native Continental Ancestry Group;Food,NA,NA

Seafood consumption is considered the main source of PBDEs and their methoxylated congeners (MeO-BDEs) for humans. The present study aims to investigate the seasonal occurrence of six PBDEs and eight MeO-BDEs congeners using Douro river biota (different trophic levels) as sentinels, as well as to evaluate the human exposure risk to PBDEs through seafood consumption. Biota samples (n = 273) were collected from one of the most important Portuguese estuaries in the north-western coast of Portugal at four different seasons (2019-2020). The analyses were performed by an environmental-friendly extraction procedure followed by Gas Chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole detector (GC-MS/MS). PBDEs were detected in all seafood samples analysed, with means ranging from 0.02 ng g & minus;1 ww (flounder in autumn) to 3.75 ng g & minus;1 ww (mussel in winter). Levels of lowerbrominated PBDE congeners were significantly higher than higher-brominated ones in all seasons (p < 0.01). MeO-BDEs ranged from 0.001 ng g & minus;1 ww (grey mullet in summer) to 5.66 ng g & minus;1 ww (green crab in spring). Crabs and mussels presented the highest means of PBDEs and MeO-BDEs. Regarding the health risk assessment of the studied PBDE congeners (47, 99, and 153), consumption of Douro river fish is not a case of concern for consumers. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This study analyzed legacy PFASs and potential precursors in surface water, groundwater, soil, and aquifer solid samples collected from a typical arid area, the Hetao Irrigation District of Northern China, to explore PFASs distribution and transformation between surface and ground. Total PFASs (Sigma PFASs) in surface water was 29-232 ng/L, higher than 2-77 ng/L in groundwater. Sigma PFASs in soil were 0.29-0.59 ng/g, higher than 0.09-0.27 in the aquifer solids. Regarding horizontal distribution, the concentration of PFASs in groundwater in-creased in downtowns and the areas recharged with lake water. In terms of vertical distribution, Sigma PFASs decreased with the increase of depth, and more PFASs adsorbed on clay particles in the aquifer. The total oxidable precursor anal-ysis showed that 8:2 FT and 4:2 FT were the dominant precursors of PFASs, resulting in an increment of 0.1-4 ng/L PFASs. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope compositions suggest similar sources between surface water and ground-water in the study area, while principal component analysis and Bayesian inference also indicate that surface water is an important source of groundwater PFASs.

The concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models have been developed to predict mixture toxicity. Both models assume no interaction between the components, resulting in an additive mixture effect. In the present study, the embryo toxicity test (OECD TG no. 236) with zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) was performed to investigate whether the toxicity caused by binary, ternary, and quaternary mixtures of organic (Benzo[a]pyrene, perfluorooctanesulfonate, and 3,3´,4,4´,5-pentachlorobiphenyl 126) and inorganic (arsenate) pollutants can be predicted by CA and IA. The acute toxicity and sub-lethal alterations such as lack of blood circulation were investigated. The models estimated the mixture toxicity well and most of the mixtures were additive. However, the binary mixture of PFOS and PCB126 caused a synergistic effect, with almost a ten-fold difference between the observed and predicted LC50-value. For most of the mixtures, the CA model was better in predicting the mixture toxicity than the IA model, which was not expected due to the chemicals’ different modes of action. In addition, some of the mixtures caused sub-lethal effects not observed in the single compound toxicity tests. The mixture of PFOS and BaP caused a division of the yolk and imbalance was caused by the combination of PFOS and As and the ternary mixture of PFOS, As, and BaP. Interestingly, PFOS was part of all three mixtures causing the mixture specific sub-lethal effects. In conclusion, the present study shows that CA and IA are mostly resulting in good estimations of the risks that mixtures with few components are posing. However, for a more reliable assessment and a better understanding of mixture toxicity, further investigations are required to study the underlying mechanisms. © 2022",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106175,Animals;Article;animal;nonhuman;Binary mixtures;Concentration addition;Independent action;Mixture toxicity;Mixtures;Quaternary mixture;Ternary;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);prediction;drug mixture;risk assessment;toxicity;embryo;blood;chemical analysis;zebra fish;toxicity testing;egg yolk;LC50;organic pollutant;pollution;Zebrafish;environment;acute toxicity;LD50;toxic substance;embryotoxicity;cyprinid;circulation;benzo[a]pyrene;Lethal Dose 50;Toxicity Tests;sublethal effect;Water Pollutants;teratogenesis;yolk sac;Chemical;4;4';3;arsenic acid;Development;edema;3';5 pentachlorobiphenyl;blood cell;inorganic matter;lordosis;Organisation for Economic Co-operation;scoliosis;synergistic effect;tremor;Teratogens,NA,NA

Median concentrations of 6:2 Cl-PFESA and OBS in fish tissues were 0.046–6.0 and 0.46–5.1 ng/g wet weight, respectively. The highest concentrations of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was found in fish livers, whereas OBS was found in the pancreas, brain, gonads, and skin. The tissue distribution pattern of 6:2 Cl-PFESA is similar to that of PFOS. The tissue/liver ratios of OBS were higher than those of PFOS, suggesting that OBS has a greater tendency to transfer from the liver to other tissues. The logarithmic bioaccumulation factors (log BAFs) of 6:2 Cl-PFESA in three carnivorous fish species were greater than 3.7, whereas those of OBS were less than 3.7, indicating that 6:2 Cl-PFESA had a strong bioaccumulation potential. Notably, sex- and tissue-specific bioaccumulation of OBS has also been observed in catfish. Most tissues (except the gonads) exhibited higher OBS concentrations in males than in females. However, no differences were found for 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS.

This study investigated the re-organization and self-assembly of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and macronutrient molecules from rhizospheric organic (RhO) matter induced with a common operation of aeration. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) with infrared spectroscopy (IR)-mapping clearly showed that, after aeration and stabilization, RhO nanocapsules (∼ 1000 nm or smaller) with a core of PFOS-protein complexes coated by “lipid-carbohydrate” layers were observed whereas the capsule structure with a lipid core surrounded by “protein-carbohydrate-protein” multilayers was obtained in the absence of PFOS. It is aeration that exerted the disassociation of pristine RhO components, after which the environmental concentration PFOS restructured the self-assembly structure in a conspicuous “disorder-to-order” transition. AFM IR-mapping analysis of faeces combined with quantification of component uptake denoted the decreased ingestion and utilization of both PFOS and proteins compared with lipids and carbohydrates when Daphnia magna were fed with RhO nanocapsules. RhO nanocapsules acted as double-edged swords via simultaneously impeding the bioaccessibility of hazardous PFOS molecules and macronutrient proteins; and the latter might be more significant, which caused a malnutrition status within merely 48 h.

In this study, the novel cationic covalent organic framework (COF) was developed via an imine condensation reaction for efficient removal of GenX and HFPO-TA from aqueous solution. The prepared COFs exhibited a 2D ordering hexagonal structure with AA stacking and two classes of pores (mesopore and micropore). The introduction of quaternary ammonium on COF exhibited little effect on its morphology and crystal structure. The cationic COF with quaternary ammonium showed high adsorption capacity for GenX (2.06 mmol/g) and HFPO-TA (2.16 mmol/g), more efficient than conventional activated carbons and resins. The effects of pH and natural organic matter on the removal efficiency of GenX and HFPO-TA on COF were also investigated. Interestingly, the previously adsorbed GenX on the cationic COF was replaced by the longer-chain HFPO-TA, and the underlying competitive mechanism was further clarified by performing a density functional theory calculation. This study highlights the exceptional potential of COFs through topology structural design for the efficient removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances from aqueous solution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.cej.2020.127509,Adsorption;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctanoic acid;Dimers;Hexafluoropropylene oxide;Environmental contaminant;PFOA;GenX;Morphology;HFPO-TA;Covalent organic frameworks;Density functional theory;High adsorption capacity;Competitive mechanism;Condensation reactions;Crystal structure;crystal structures;Natural organic matters;Structural design,NA,NA

Here, we have asked if metabolic reprogramming by PKC8 contributes to radioprotection. Analysis of global metabolomics showed that depletion of PKC8 affects metabolic pathways that control energy production and antioxidant, nucleotide, and amino acid biosynthesis. Increased NADPH and nucleotide production in PKC8-depleted cells is associated with upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) as evidenced by increased activation of G6PD and an increase in the nucleotide precursor, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Stable isotope tracing with U -[13C6] glucose showed reduced utilization of glucose for glycolysis in PKC8-depleted cells and no increase in U -[13C6] glucose incorporation into purines or pyrimidines. In contrast, isotope tracing with [13C5, 15N2] glutamine showed increased utilization of glutamine for synthesis of nucleotides, glutathione, and tricarboxylic acid intermediates and increased incorporation of labeled glutamine into pyruvate and lactate. Using a glycolytic rate assay, we confirmed that anaerobic glycolysis is increased in PKC8-depleted cells; this was accompanied by a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation, as assayed using a mitochondrial stress assay. Importantly, pretreatment of cells with specific inhibitors of the PPP or glutaminase prior to irradiation reversed radioprotection in PKC8-depleted cells, indicating that these cells have acquired codependency on the PPP and glutamine for survival. Our studies demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming to increase utilization of glutamine and nucleotide synthesis contributes to radioprotection in the context of PKC8 inhibition.",NA,10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105186,Protein Kinase C;Protein Kinases,NA,NA

Due to its toxicity and persistence, the efficient removal of triclocarban from wastewater systems is challenging. Genetic bioaugmentation with transferable catabolic plasmids has been considered to be a long-lasting method to clean up pollutants in continuous flow wastewater treatment systems. In this study, bioaugmentation with Pseudomonas putida KT2440, harboring the transferrable triclocarban-catabolic plasmid pDCA-1-gfp-tccA2, rapidly converted 50 mu M triclocarban in wastewater into 3,4-dichloroaniline and 4-chloroaniline, which are further mineralized more easily. RT-qPCR results showed that the ratio of the copy number of pDCA-1-gfp-tccA2 to the cell number of strain KT2440 gradually increased during genetic bioaugmentation, suggesting horizontal transfer and proliferation of the plasmid. By using DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) and amplicon sequencing, OTU86 (Escherichia-Shigella), OTU155 (Citrobacter), OTU5 (Brucella), and OTU15 (Enterobacteriaceae) were found to be the potential recipients of the plasmid pDCA-1-gfp-tccA2 in the wastewater bacterial community. Furthermore, three transconjugants in the genera of Escherichia, Citrobacter, and Brucella showing triclocarban-degrading abilities were isolated from the wastewater.

The present study analyzed the occurrence of HNPs in the edible muscle of the three most consumed commercial fish species in the state of Rio de Janeiro: sardine ( Sardinella brasiliensis ), whitemouth croaker ( Micropogonias furnieri ) and mullet ( Mugil liza ) from the highly polluted Guanabara Bay (GB) and the less polluted Ilha Grande Bay (IGB). The analytical steps included Soxhlet extraction, clean-up step and injection in a gas chromatography system coupled to a mass spectrometer operated in the electron-capture negative ion mode (GC/ECNI-MS).

Its structure is similar to fatty acids, which enables it to induce the expression of ACOT genes. To investigate the expression levels of Acot1 in various tissues and organs after exposure to PFOA for 28 days in rats, and to compare the variations of Acot1 expression in different tissues, we sectioned samples and incubated with Acot1 antibody. The results show that the transcription and protein expression levels of Acot1 in the liver and kidney of rats increased significantly. Meanwhile, the transcription and protein expression of Acot1 gene were also detected in testis, muscle, and adipose. The results of immunohistochemistry were also verified by western blot detection, and we detected the transcription of Acot1 gene in these tissues and found that they all increased in varying degrees. In this study, the expression of Acot1 protein in rat serum was detected for the first time, and the expression of Acot1 in rat serum was found to be significantly increased after PFOA exposure. In addition, the expression level of Acot1 in rat organism was found to be higher than that in the control group after 4 days of depuration for 7 days of acute PFOA exposure, and Acot1 protein expression also showed an increase with increasing exposure time, indicating that Acot1 can be used as a sensitive biomarker for health monitoring of PFOA occupational workers or exposed persons. © 2022 The Author(s).

To inform methods for prioritizing these data-poor chemicals for detailed toxicity studies, we evaluated 142 PFAS using an in vitro screening platform consisting of two multiplexed transactivation assays encompassing 81 diverse transcription factor activities and tested in concentration-response format ranging from 137 nM to 300 μM. Results showed activity for various nuclear receptors, including three known PFAS targets–specifically estrogen receptor alpha and peroxisome proliferator receptors alpha and gamma. We also report activity against the retinoid X receptor beta, the key heterodimeric partner of type II, non-steroidal nuclear receptors. Additional activities were found against the pregnane X receptor, nuclear receptor related-1 protein, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, a sensor of oxidative stress. Using orthogonal assay approaches, we confirmed activity of representative PFAS against several of these targets.

Our results showed that the capacities of resins absorbing PFASs were ranked in the following order: gel strong base HPR4700 (297 300 μg/g) ≈ macroreticular strong base S6368 (294 300 μg/g) ≈ macroreticular weak base A111S (289 300 μg/g) > gel weak base WA10 (233 297 μg/g).

Apex predators occupy the top trophic positions in ecosystems and are most affected by the biomagnification behavior of PFASs. Meanwhile, the long lifespans of apex predators also lead to the high body burden of PFASs. The high body burden of PFASs might be linked to adverse health effects and even pose a potential threat to their reproduction. As seen in previous reviews of PFASs, knowledge is lacking between the current stage of the PFAS body burden and related effects in apex predators.

NMPA was derivatized with PFPA to form an N,N'-bis (pentafluoroacyl) derivative (NMPA-PFPA) and analyzed by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-IT-MS/MS) using negative ion electrospray ionization (ESI). Chromatographic behavior of several perfluorocarboxylic acid anhydride derivatives of NMPA and other structurally related diamines on C-18 and perfluorophenyl (PFP) columns was studied. Conversion of the parent drugs to NMPA under various hydrolysis conditions was evaluated. In addition, comparison of the matrix effect and linearity with isotopically labeled internal standard (I.S.) and analogous I.S. were performed and investigated. The method was validated using fortified bovine muscle samples. The apparent recovery (obtained after correction with an isotopically labeled I.S.) was between 89% and 97% and repeatability was less than 10%. The lowest LOD and LOQ (0.42 and 1.39 mu g/kg, respectively) were obtained with LC-QqQ-MS/MS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA,10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.060,Mass Spectrometry,NA,NA

It is of particular interest to understand their transfer from roots to shoots and transformation in plants, such as wheat. The results of hydroponic experiments indicated that C6/C6 PFPiA, C8/C8 PFPiA, perfluorooctanophosphonic acid (PFOPA), and perfluorohexaphosphonic acid (PFHxPA) were quickly adsorbed on the epidermis of wheat root (Triticum aestivum L.), which was driven by their hydrophobicity. A small fraction of the accumulated PFPiAs and PFPAs in the wheat root was subjected to absorption via an active process dependent on H+-ATPase. PFHxPA, which has the smallest molecular weight and medium hydrophilicity (log Kow < 4), displayed the strongest absorption efficiency via the water and anion channels and had the highest translocation potential from roots to shoots in wheat. C6/C6 and C8/C8 PFPiAs experienced phase I metabolism in wheat, although at a low rate, to form more persistent PFHxPA and PFOPA, respectively, as well as 1H-perfluorohexane (1H-PFHx) and 1H-perfluorooctane (1H-PFO), which were regulated by cytochrome P450 in wheat root. As a result, exposure to PFPiAs in roots ultimately caused the accumulation of more persistent PFPAs in the above-ground parts of plants, raising concerns on their potential risks on human health. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/ACS.EST.9B05656,Humans;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Health risks;Triticum;wheat;human;soil;Soil;soil pollutant;Soil Pollutants;Plants (botany);Biological Transport;plant root;Plant Roots;Water absorption;Uptake mechanism;transport at the cellular level;hydroponics;Agricultural fields;Wheat roots;Hydroponics;Hydroponic experiments;Industrial fields;Root to shoot;Transformation mechanisms;Triticum aestivum L;Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),NA,NA

Previous studies mainly focused on aquatic biota; however, the knowledge about the ecotoxicological risk they pose to terrestrial plants was still lacking. In this study, the accumulation of two Cl-PFAES (6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFAES) and PFOS in wheat seedlings at environmentally relevant levels (50 and 100 μg L−1) was investigated. Concentrations of Cl-PFAESs in the roots were an order of magnitude higher than those in shoots, indicating that they were primarily accumulated in the roots. The values of root and shoot bioconcentration factor was comparable between 6:2 Cl-PFAES and PFOS. However, these indexes of 8:2 Cl-PFAES were 42–91% higher and 70–76% lower than PFOS, respectively. As a result, 6:2 Cl-PFAES had a similar accumulation pattern as PFOS, whereas 8:2 Cl-PFAES was predominantly restricted to the roots, which might be attributed to their hydrophobicity and carbon chain length. In addition, at 250 mg L−1 of Cl-PFAESs, plant biomass and pigment content were 24–30% and 0.4–18%, respectively, which were lower than those of PFOS. As compared with PFOS, Cl-PFAESs induced higher levels of root membrane permeability, reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde content, as well as reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione content. These suggested the occurrence of a severer oxidative damage and the breakdown of the antioxidant defence system in wheat cells. Therefore, we conclude that Cl-PFAESs might pose a higher potential threat to the environment than PFOS. © 2020",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126447,Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS);Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Antioxidants;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Ether;Ethers;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;bioaccumulation;hydrophobicity;Chlorine compounds;Wheat seedlings;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;Triticum;wheat;phytotoxicity;toxicity;metabolism;glutathione;physiology;ether derivative;electrospray;enzyme activity;nutrient;soil pollutant;Soil Pollutants;ether;malonaldehyde;Oxidative stress;reactive oxygen metabolite;Reactive oxygen species;reactive oxygen species;antioxidant;Accumulation;accumulation;Alkanesulfonates;Malondialdehyde;Plants (botany);oxygen;antioxidant activity;hydrogen peroxide;Phytotoxicity;plant root;biomass;shoot;Triticum aestivum;seedling;root;Chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonates (Cl-PFAESs);membrane permeability;Seedlings;Sulfones,NA,NA

This greenhouse study used reclaimed water augmented with varying concentrations (0.2-40 mu g/L) of PFAAs, including perfluorocarboxylates (C3F7COO- to C8F17COO-) and perfluorosulfonates (C4F9SO2O-, C6F13SO2O-, C8F17SO2O-), to investigate potential uptake and concentration-response trends in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and strawberry (Fragaria ananassa). In addition, studies were conducted to evaluate the role of soil organic carbon concentrations on plant uptake of PFAAs. PFAA concentrations in lettuce leaves and strawberry fruit were measured for each aqueous PFAA concentration applied. PFAA plant concentrations increased linearly with the aqueous concentration for all PFAAs, with PFCAs bioaccumulating to a greater degree than PFSAs in the edible portions of the tested plants. Chain-length-dependency trends were evident in both lettuce shoot and strawberry fruit, with decreasing concentrations associated with increasing chain length. Perfluorobutanoate (PFBA) and perfluoropentanoate (PFPeA), both short-chain PFAAs (<8 carbon chain length), accumulated the most compared with other PFAAs tested in the edible parts of both lettuce and strawberry. PFAA concentrations in strawberry root and shoot were also measured at selected PFAA aqueous concentrations (0.4, 4, and 40 mug/L). Short-chain perfluorocarboxylates were the dominant fraction in the strawberry fruit and shoot compartments, whereas a more even distribution of all PFAAs appeared in the root compartment. Lettuce grown in soils with varying organic carbon contents (0.4%, 2%, 6%) was used to assess the impact of organic carbon sorption on PFAA bioaccumulation. The lettuce grown in soil with the 6% organic carbon content had the lowest bioaccumulation of PFAAs. Bioaccumulation factors for lettuce were correlated to carbon chain length of PFAAs, showing approximately a 0.4 to 0.6 log decrease per CF2 group. This study confirms that PFAAs can enter and bioaccumulate in food crops irrigated with reclaimed water.

Bioaccumulation of MNPs reached 50% of steady-state condition within 1 h. The presence of algae inhibited the ingestion and depuration of MNPs. To further demonstrate the effects of such accumulation on gut health, we further applied the AIE probes for visualizing the pH and esterase in the digestive tract, as well as the gut inflammation. An accumulation of MNPs in D. magna significantly and rapidly induced the acidification of gut pH while inducing esterase activity. The NPs apparently induced gut inflammation in contrast to the MPs, demonstrating the size-dependent effects on oxidative stress.

Perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanol-based phosphate (SAmPAP) esters are among numerous potential PFOS-precursors which have not been previously detected in the environment and for which little is known about their stability. Based on their high production volume during the 1970s-2002 and widespread use in food contact paper and packaging, SAmPAP esters may be potentially significant sources of PFOS. Here we report for the first time on the environmental occurrence of SAmPAP diester in marine sediments from an urbanized marine harbor in Vancouver, Canada. SAmPAP diester concentrations in sediment (40-200 pg/g dry weight) were similar to those of PFOS (71-180 pg/g). A significant (p < 0.05) correlation was observed between SAmPAP diester and N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetate (an anticipated degradation product of SAmPAP diester). ΣPFOS-precursor (FOSAM) concentrations in sediment (120-1100 pg/g) were 1.6-24 times greater than those of PFOS in sediment. Although SAmPAP diester was not detected in water, PFOS was observed at concentrations up to 710 pg/L. Among the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances monitored in the present work, mean log-transformed sediment/water distribution coefficients ranged from 2.3 to 4.3 and increased with number of CF 2 units and N-alkyl substitution (in the case of FOSAMs). Overall, these results highlight the importance of FOSAMs as potentially significant sources of PFOS, in particular for urban marine environments.

In this study we presented in dose- and time-dependent manner the impact of PFAs on calcium homeostasis in HCT116 cells. Comparative analysis of cytosolic [Ca super(2+)] sub(c) and mitochondrial calcium [Ca super(2+)] sub(m) carried out by flow cytometry revealed distinct uptake of calcium into mitochondria in correlation to increasing lipophilicity of PFAs. Massive accumulation of [Ca super(2+)] sub(m) was not accompanied by equivalent loss of [Ca super(2+)] sub(c).

PFOA is used in the production of fluoropolymers which have applications in the manufacture of a variety of industrial and commercial products (e.g., textiles, house wares, electronics). PFOA is developmentally toxic and in mice affects growth, development, and viability of offspring. This study segregates the contributions of gestational and lactational exposures and considers the impact of restricting exposure to specific gestational periods. Pregnant CD-1 mice were dosed on gestation days (GD) 1-17 with 0, 3, or 5 mg PFOA/kg body weight, and pups were fostered at birth to give seven treatment groups: unexposed controls, pups exposed in utero (3U and 5U), lactationally (3L and 5L), or in utero + lactationally (3U + L and 5U + L). In the restricted exposure (RE) study, pregnant mice received 5 mg PFOA/kg from GD7-17, 10-17, 13-17, or 15-17 or 20 mg on GD15-17. In all PFOA-treated groups, dam weight gain, number of implantations, and live litter size were not adversely affected and relative liver weight increased. Treatment with 5 mg/kg on GD1-17 increased the incidence of whole litter loss and pups in surviving litters had reduced birth weights, but effects on pup survival from birth to weaning were only affected in 5U + L litters. In utero exposure (5U), in the absence of lactational exposure, was sufficient to produce postnatal body weight deficits and developmental delay in the pups. In the RE study, birth weight and survival were reduced by 20 mg/kg on GD15-17. Birth weight was also reduced by 5 mg/kg on GD7-17 and 10-17. Although all PFOA-exposed pups had deficits in postnatal weight gain, only those exposed on GD7-17 and 10-17 also showed developmental delay in eye opening and hair growth. In conclusion, the postnatal developmental effects of PFOA are due to gestational exposure. Exposure earlier in gestation produced stronger responses, but further study is needed to determine if this is a function of higher total dose or if there is a developmentally sensitive period. © 2007 Oxford University Press.",NA,10.1093/toxsci/kfl159,Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Body Weight;Mice;Pregnancy;Birth Weight;female;male;Male;nonhuman;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;animal tissue;mouse;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;blood level;article;newborn;prenatal exposure;animal cell;liver weight;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;birth weight;developmental disorder;Developmental toxicity;newborn mortality;teratogenicity;weight reduction;Gestational Age;Organ Size;Octanoic Acids;Mus;postnatal development;lactation;Lactation;litter size;Litter Size;Inbred Strains;Cross-foster;hair growth;Prenatal sensitivity;Foster Home Care,NA,NA

Detection limits ranged between 0.02 (PFHxS) and 0.85 ng/L (PFOA). The most frequent compounds were PFOS and PFHxS, which were detected in 35 and 31 samples, with maximum concentrations of 58.1 and 5.30 ng/L, respectively. PFBuS, PFHxA, and PFOA were also frequently detected (29, 27, and 26 samples, respectively), with maximum levels of 69.4, 8.55, and 57.4 ng/L. In contrast, PFDoDA and PFTDA could not be detected in any sample. The most contaminated water samples were found in the Barcelona Province, whereas none of the analyzed PFCs could be detected in two samples (Banyoles and Lleida), and only one PFC could be detected in four of the samples. Assuming a human water consumption of 2 L/day, the maximum daily intake of PFOS and PFOA from municipal drinking water would be, for a subject of 70 kg of body weight, 1.7 and 1.6 ng/kg/day. This is clearly lower than the respective Tolerable Daily Intake set by the European Food Safety Authority. In all samples, PFOS and PFOA also showed lower levels than the short-term provisional health advisory limit for drinking water (200 ng PFOS/L and 400 ng PFOA/L) set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Although PFOS and PFOA concentrations found in drinking water in Catalonia are not expected to pose human health risks, safety limits for exposure to the remaining PFCs are clearly necessary, as health-based drinking water concentration protective for lifetime exposure is set to 40 ng/L for PFOA. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,10.1007/s00244-009-9375-y,Fluorocarbons;Humans;Europe;Environmental Exposure;Spain;perfluoro compound;Catalonia;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;water pollution;risk assessment;human;article;drinking water;priority journal;water contamination;health hazard;health risk;sampling;water supply;population exposure;Quality Control;Eurasia;Water Pollutants;Southern Europe;Chemical;Water Supply;water standard;water chemistry;water use;health services;Urban Health;Drinking,NA,NA

A biocide paint containing zinc pyrithione (ZnPT2) and cuprous oxide was assessed as a positive control. A standardized laboratory rotating-cylinder method using each test cylinder with artificial seawater was performed for 45 days. After 1 h rotation, the leaked seawater was subjected for bioassay and chemical analyses twice weekly. The seawater extracts from the biocide paint showed adverse effects on bacteria, algae, and crustaceans, but those from the biocide-free paints did not. The leakage seawater from biocide-free paints, after 7-day continuous rotation, contained the same concentration levels of PFAS as blank seawater used to conduct the tests. Thus, no significant toxicities of the biocide-free paints were found under the conditions of this study. Simultaneous analysis of ZnPT2 and copper pyrithione (CuPT2) was developed using an HPLC with a polymeric resin column, showing that ZnPT2 was converted to CuPT2 by trans-chelation in the leakage seawater from the positive control paint. The experimental results using a laboratory rotating-cylinder method demonstrated that biocide-free paints did not markedly affect three species tested and no PFAS was detected. In contrast, biocide paint was significantly toxic to test species and toxicity of the extract on bacteria was partly responsible for CuPT2 produced in leakage seawater. Thus, a laboratory rotating-cylinder method may be applied for ecotoxicological assessment of antifouling paints. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",NA,10.1080/02772248.2012.662811,Bacteria;Organic pollutants;Chemical analysis;Toxicity;pesticide;environmental impact assessment;ecotoxicology;pollution effect;toxicity test;bacterium;Copper;Zinc;Bacteria (microorganisms);Crustacea;Silicones;Fluorine containing polymers;algae;Algae;Bioassay;perfluoroalkyl substances;alga;crustacean;resin;seawater;Cylinders (shapes);Seawater effects;bioluminescence;antifouling;Antifouling paint;Biocides;biofouling;Biofouling;copper pyrithione;luminescent bacteria;Luminescent bacteria;microalga;Microalga;zinc pyrithione;Rotation,NA,NA

Through co-citation cluster analysis, in addition to the in-depth exploration of traditional POPs, research on emerging POPs such as cyclic volatile methyl siloxane and dechlorane plus were new research frontiers. The distribution and transfer of POPs in the soil-air environment have attracted the most attention, and the regional grid model based on fugacity has been gradually improved and developed.

Livestock and poultry meats (chicken, beef, mutton) account for a significant proportion of dietary consumption in China, and thus it is crucial to investigate the levels and composition profiles of PFCs in consumer meats to assess and mitigate potential health risks. However, rapid and simple analytical methods for such investigations are lacking. This study addresses this shortcoming by developing a rapid filtration clean-up method using carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CMWCNTs) for the detection of 14 PFCs. Good linearities (R2 > 0.99) were obtained for all 14 PFCs in chicken, beef, and mutton. Recoveries ranged from 65 to 145% (except perfluorotetradecanoic acid, PFTeDA) with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 16%. Method limits of detection (LODs) were between 0.12 and 0.83 ng g−1d.w. Subsequently, this method was applied for the analysis of 46 livestock and poultry meat samples collected from markets in Shanghai. PFCs were detected in all samples with total concentrations of 1.61–4.27 ng g−1 wet weight (w.w) in chicken, 1.51–5.56 ng g−1 w.w in beef and 1.61–8.15 ng g−1 w.w in mutton. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were the predominant compounds in these samples and accounted for over 92% of ΣPFCs. For regulated compounds such as PFOA, risk quotients (RQs) were determined to be much lower than 1. This suggests that chicken, beef, and mutton from Shanghai market pose very low PFC exposure risk to residents. However, high detection frequency of the unregulated PFBA demands further investigation of short-chain PFCs in consumer meats. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.108330,Carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes;Dietary risk assessment;Perfluorinated compounds;UPLC-MS/MS;Livestock;poultry meats;Risk Assessment;Chickens,NA,NA

Few data are available on PFOS-precursor biodegradation in other environmental compartments, and nothing is known about the stability of high-molecular-weight perfluorooctane sulfonamide-based substances such as the EtFOSE-based phosphate diester (SAmPAP diester) in any environmental compartment. In the present work, the biodegradation potential of SAmPAP diester and EtFOSE by bacteria in marine sediments was evaluated over 120 days at 4 and 25 degrees C. At both temperatures, EtFOSE was transformed to a suite of products, including N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetate, perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetate, N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Transformation was significantly more rapid at 25 degrees C (t(1/2) = 44 +/- 3.4 days; error represents standard error of the mean (SEM)) compared to 4 degrees C (t(1/2) = 160 +/- 17 days), but much longer than previous biodegradation studies involving EtFOSE in sludge (t(1/2) similar to 0.7-4.2 days). In contrast, SAmPAP diester was highly recalcitrant to microbial degradation, with negligible loss and/or associated product formation observed after 120 days at both temperatures, and an estimated half-life of >380 days at 25 degrees C (estimated using the lower bounds 95% confidence interval of the slope). We hypothesize that the hydrophobicity of SAmPAP diester reduces its bioavailability, thus limiting biotransformation by bacteria in sediments. The lengthy biodegradation half-life of EtFOSE and recalcitrant nature of SAmPAP diester in part explains the elevated concentrations of PFOS-precursors observed in urban marine sediments from Canada, Japan, and the U.S, over a decade after phase-out of their production and commercial application in these countries.",NA,10.1021/es304336r,Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;wastewater;Microbiology;Perfluorooctane sulfonamide;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Sulfur compounds;Canada;Sulfonamides;Bacteria;United States;Hydrocarbons;Organophosphates;Japan;nonhuman;unclassified drug;bioavailability;hydrophobicity;organophosphate;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctane sulfonamide;urban area;sulfonic acid derivative;article;sediment;Commercial applications;biotransformation;organic compound;sludge;Wastewater treatment plants;waste water management;bacterium;biodegradation;water treatment;Geologic Sediments;molecular analysis;temperature;sediment pollution;Esters;Half-Life;data set;marine sediment;Ethanol;Elevated concentrations;Biodegradation;Confidence interval;Environmental compartment;Environmental;Fluorinated;Diesters;Biodegradation potentials;Biodegradation studies;ethanol;High molecular weight;Low molecular weight;Lower bounds;Marine sediments;microbial degradation;Microbial degradation;n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide;n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetate;perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetate;Product formation;sludge treatment;stabilization;Standard error of the means;Submarine geology;Military Personnel,NA,NA

The cod liver samples contained BDE congeners but also abundant signals for the natural 2,3,3',4,4',5,5'-heptachloro-1'methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole Q1 and tribromoanisole (TBA). The mussel sample contained Q1, TBA, another halogenated anisole, BC-1, BC-2, and BC-3, as well as additional, potential natural brominated compounds in the elution range of tribromophenoxyanisoles.

The mean concentrations of PFAAs in the gaseous phase and the particulate phase were 40.31 ± 31.47 pg/m3 and 63.26 ± 41.87 pg/m3, respectively. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) was the predominant contaminant in the gaseous phase (32.56% ± 9.28%), while perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the main contaminant in the particulate phase (33.21% ± 18.69%). The ratios of gaseous to particulate distribution ranged from 0.01 to 16.75. The gaseous-particulate partitioning coefficients, ranging from 0.01 to 23.41 ± 10−2 m3/μg, were significantly correlated with PM10 concentrations and meteorological conditions, such as temperature and air pressure. The inhalation exposures of PFOA and PFOS were 1.94–60.2 pg/(kg·d) and 0.30–4.22 pg/(kg·d), respectively. The carcinogenic risk of PFOA for urban males was the highest and that for rural females was the lowest; the risks were lower than the acceptable level (10−6) defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).

Especially field-based effect studies in aquatic ecosystems are generally lacking, creating a knowledge gap that goes along with monitoring and regulatory challenges. Therefore, this study examined if bioaccumulated PFAS concentrations could be related to ecological responses assessed by changes in the macroinvertebrate community structure. In addition, threshold body burdens that are protective of ecological damage were estimated. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were sampled in 30 streams across Flanders (Belgium) and 28 PFAS target analytes were measured in three resident taxa (Gammarus sp., Asellus sp. and Chironomus sp.) and translocated zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). The macroinvertebrate community structure was assessed by calculating the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF). Primarily long-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were detected in both resident taxa (passive biomonitoring) and zebra mussels (active biomonitoring). Based on a 90th quantile regression model, safe threshold body burdens could be calculated for PFTeDA (7.1 ng/g ww) and ΣPFAS (2264 ng/g ww) in Gammarus sp. and for PFOA (5.5 ng/g ww), PFDoDA (1.7 ng/g ww), PFTrDA (0.51 ng/g ww), PFTeDA (2.4 ng/g ww), PFOS (644 ng/g ww) and ΣPFAS (133 ng/g ww) in zebra mussel. An additional threshold value was calculated for most compounds and species using the 95th percentile method. However, although these estimated thresholds are pertinent and indicative, regulatory applicability requires further lines of evidence and validation. Nevertheless, this study offers first-time evidence of associations between accumulated PFAS concentrations in invertebrates and a reduced ecological water quality in terms of macroinvertebrate community structure and highlights the potential of Gammarus sp. and zebra mussels to serve as reliable PFAS biomonitoring species. © 2024 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170611,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Belgium;animal;concentration (parameter);ecosystem;Ecosystem;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;biological monitoring;biomonitoring;controlled study;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;pollution exposure;Regression analysis;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;source apportionment;water pollution;Body burden;analysis;perfluorinated carboxylic acid;body burden;Body Burden;Flanders;Molluscs;Water Pollutants;Dreissena polymorpha;water quality;Water quality;Chemical;Aquatic ecosystems;community structure;mussel culture;Active biomonitoring;aquatic invertebrate;Aquatic macroinvertebrates;Asellus;Chironomus;community response;Community structures;Dreissena;Gammarus;macroinvertebrate;Macroinvertebrate community;Macroinvertebrates;Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders;organism community;Passive biomonitoring;stream (river);threshold body burden;Water Quality;Zebra mussels,NA,NA

This study analysed the replacing of legacy PFASs in China using PFASs data from residential soils, which might be good environmental indicators of their present usage. The total concentrations of 21 PFASs ranged from 244 to 13564 pg/g, and PFOA was the dominant compound among the studied PFASs, with a concentration of 354 ± 439 pg/g. Serious PFASs pollution in residential soils mainly occurred in Eastern Coastal China as a result of locally developed industry and economies. Weak but significant correlations were found between PFASs and environmental and socioeconomic factors, suggesting that various factors determine PFASs contamination in residential soils. The concentration and detection frequency (DF) of short-chain analogues (C < 8) (375 ± 509 pg/g and 100%), and F-53B (216 ± 306 pg/g and 98.9%) were higher than those for PFOS (193 ± 502 pg/g and 85.4%), indicating that these compounds have been widely used as PFOS alternatives and their consumption has already exceeded that of PFOS in China. In addition, GenX (the PFOA alternative) had a concentration and DF of 19.1 ± 104 pg/g and 40.5%, respectively. These values were much lower than those for PFOA (354 ± 439 pg/g and 96.6%), indicating GenX consumption is still limited at the national scale of China, despite its use as a PFOA replacement. Moreover, the low concentration and DF of FC-98 (2.31 ± 11.1 pg/g and 27.0%) indicate that its consumption might be negligible. Our study demonstrated that short chain analogues and emerging alternatives have become the dominant PFAS pollutants in Chinese residential soils, and further studies need to be conducted to understand their toxicity and environmental risks. © 2019",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2019.105419,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;concentration (parameter);fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;controlled study;environmental monitoring;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);alkanesulfonic acid;surfactant;toxicity;soil;Housing;residential area;polyfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;Soil;soil pollution;Soils;Soil pollution;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;soil analysis;environmental factor;socioeconomics;environmental risk;coastal zone;per;Economics;Legacy PFASs;f 53b;alternatives;Environmental indicators;fc 98;genx;residential location;Residential soil;Residential soils;Short chain analogues,NA,NA

Extraction was performed with acetonitrile followed by a clean-up and fractionation step and instrumental analysis by UPLC/MS/MS and GC/MS. Time trends of PFSAs and their precursors in herring muscle samples originating from the Kattegat at the west coast of Sweden were investigated covering the years 1991-2011. The following analytes were detected, all with decreasing or unchanged trends between 1991 and 2011: Perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS, below the method detection limit (<. MDL)-10. pg/g), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS, 9-38. pg/g), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS, 240-930. pg/g), perfluorodecane sulfonic acid (PFDS, <.

The highest concentrations were found for PFOS and FOSA around the turn of the century. Shorter disappearance half-lives were observed for precursors compared to PFSAs. Assuming that these trend differences are representative for fish consumed by the general Swedish population, this observation suggests that the relative contribution of precursors to total human exposure to PFOS via fish intake has decreased in Sweden over the study period. PFOS precursors in fish may have constituted a significant indirect exposure pathway for PFOS in the 1990s. Isomer-specific analysis of PFOS and FOSA revealed <. 10% relative contributions of branched isomers to total PFOS and total FOSA. Furthermore, the percentage branched isomers decreased over time for both compounds. These findings are contrary to patterns and temporal trends of PFOS isomers commonly found in human serum. In combination with literature data on isomer patterns in other edible fish species and on isomer-specific human toxicokinetics, our results suggest that fish consumption alone cannot account for the PFOS isomer patterns and trends observed in humans. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2014.01.005,Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluorooctane sulfonamide;Sulfur compounds;Sweden;Temporal trends;Liver;Sulfonamides;Food Contamination;Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry;Amides;environmental exposure;nonhuman;unclassified drug;food contamination;bioaccumulation;animal tissue;Human exposures;perfluoro compound;Muscle;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;pollution monitoring;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Chemical analysis;muscle;blood level;serum;ultra performance liquid chromatography;article;Precursors;priority journal;food chain;toxicokinetics;water contamination;seashore;food intake;mass fragmentography;limit of detection;organofluorine;trend study;food consumption;perfluorodecane sulfonic acid;temporal analysis;Isomers;liver level;acetonitrile;herring;isomer;Fishes;Human exposure;sea food;perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid;coastal zone;perfluorobutane sulfonic acid;perfluorohexane sulfonic acid;Isomerism;clupeoid;Time;Water Pollutants;muscle level;Chemical;Skeletal;perfluoroalkane sulfonamide;Perfluorooctane sulfonamides;Herring muscle;Kattegat;perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoacetic acid;perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoethanol;Sulfonic Acids;Sulfones,NA,NA

In the United States (US), federal and state agencies regulate and monitor public-supply drinking water while private-supply monitoring is rare; the current lack of directly comparable information on contaminant-mixture exposures and risks between private- and public-supplies undermines tapwater (TW) consumer decision-making. Methods: We compared private- and public-supply residential point-of-use TW at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where both supplies share the same groundwater source. TW from 10 private- and 10 public-supply homes was analyzed for 487 organic, 38 inorganic, 8 microbial indicators, and 3 in vitro bioactivities. Concentrations were compared to existing protective health-based benchmarks, and aggregated Hazard Indices (HI) of regulated and unregulated TW contaminants were calculated along with ratios of in vitro exposure-activity cutoffs. Results: Seventy organic and 28 inorganic constituents were detected in TW. Median detections were comparable, but median cumulative concentrations were substantially higher in public supply due to 6 chlorine?disinfected samples characterized by disinfection byproducts and corresponding lower heterotrophic plate counts. Publicsupply applicable maximum contaminant (nitrate) and treatment action (lead and copper) levels were exceeded in private-supply TW samples only. Exceedances of health-based HI screening levels of concern were common to both TW supplies. Discussion: These Cape Cod results indicate comparable cumulative human-health concerns from contaminant exposures in private- and public-supply TW in a shared source-water setting. Importantly, although this study?s analytical coverage exceeds that currently feasible for water purveyors or homeowners, it nevertheless is a substantial underestimation of the full breadth of contaminant mixtures documented in the environment and potentially present in drinking water. Conclusion: Regardless of the supply, increased public engagement in source-water protection and drinking-water treatment, including consumer point-of-use treatment, is warranted to reduce risks associated with long-term TW contaminant exposures, especially in vulnerable populations.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106487,Massachusetts,NA,NA

Recently, malonylcarnitine (C3DC) was shown to be elevated in the DBS of affected infants with malonic acidemia. Quantitative features were unknown, so that its measurement was an approximation. Synthesis of malonylcarnitine enabled both a study in the analytical characteristics of C3DC and a survey of its measurement in NBS laboratories. Methods: Malonylcarnitine was enriched in blood and spotted onto filter paper cards. The DBS were sent to several laboratories for analysis, and the results were returned to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for evaluation. Reports included a description of the MS/MS method utilized. Results: A pilot proficiency survey shows a bimodal distribution of data from 98 laboratories. Analysis of proficiency data reveals the use of different stable isotope internal standards for quantification. Analysis of standard, labeled or unlabelled ((2)H(3)-octanoylcarnitine (C8), glutarylcarnitine (C5DC) and malonylcarnitine (C3DC) revealed significantly different ion detection values. Quantification in laboratories is based on the ratio of the metabolite in question to a reference stable isotope standard. Conclusions: Quantification of metabolites depends upon the reference isotope standard utilized. Quantification requires describing the standards used for estimation of concentration (a pseudoconcentration) and a notation that includes a reference to the isotope standard used.

Understanding the fundamental mechanisms for degradation of PFAS is key for the development of field scalable and in-situ destructive based remediation technologies. This study aimed to elucidate and refine the current understanding of PFAS degradation mechanisms in water through a series of controlled gamma irradiation studies. Gamma irradiation of PFAS was performed using a cobalt-60 source in a batch irradiation up to 80 kGy at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS), and a suite of thirteen different PFAS (including C4-C12 PFCAs, C4, C6, C8 PFSAs, and FOSA) were irradiated to investigate degradation, influence of pH, chain length, and transformation. High resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify more than 80 fluorinated transformation products throughout the degradation experiments. These included the −F/+H, −F/+OH, −F/CH2OH exchanged PFAS and n − 1 PFCA, amongst others. Given the reactive species present (hydroxyl radicals (·OH), hydrogen radicals (·H) and aqueous electrons (e−aq)), and the degradation products formed it was shown that aqueous electrons were the key reactive species responsible for initial PFAS degradation. Most importantly, based on degradation product formation, we found that the initial −F/+H does not have to occur at the α-fluoride (nearest the functional head group), rather occurring throughout the chain length leading to more complex degradation pathways than previously postulated. While our results support some of the reaction steps postulated in the literature, we have developed a unified 16 step and 3 pathway schematic of degradation supported by experimental observations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154941,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Article;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Degradation;Mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;sulfonate;mass spectrometry;water;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;polyfluoroalkyl substance;organofluorine;Australia;chemical structure;pH;degradation;perfluorooctanesulfonamide;bioremediation;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid;Water;Chain length;Water Pollutants;hydrogen;Fluorine compounds;Chemical;fluoride;Fluorotelomers;perfluorosulfonic acid;Environmental technology;fluorotelomer sulfonate;Chains length;Remediation technologies;Degradation mechanism;electron;Fluorotelomer;gamma irradiation;Gamma irradiation;gamma radiation;Gamma rays;hydroxyl radical;irradiation;Irradiation;Radiolytic products;Reactive species,NA,NA

In this study, we built and applied suspect and nontarget screening strategies based on the mass difference of the CF2, CF2O, and CH2CF2 units to select potential novel PFASs from 117 paired maternal and cord sera. In total, 10 legacy PFASs and 19 novel PFASs from 10 classes were identified to be above confidence levels 3, among which 14 were not previously reported in human serum. Novel PFASs accounted for a considerable percentage of total PFASs in pregnant women and can be transferred to fetuses at non-negligible concentrations (i.e., 27.9% and 30.3% of total PFAS intensities in maternal and cord sera, respectively). The transplacental transfer efficiency (TTE) of PFASs showed a U-shape trend in the series of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids, perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids, and unsaturated perfluorinated alcohols. The TTE of novel PFASs is suggested to be structure-dependent, based on a flexible docking experiment. This study provides comprehensive TTE information on legacy and novel PFASs for the first time, and additional toxicity studies are needed to evaluate the risk of novel PFASs further. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.9b06505,Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Carboxylic Acids;Sulfonic Acids;Pregnancy;female;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;blood analysis;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;alkyl group;chemical substance;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;chemical compound;Environmental protection;adult;perfluoroalkyl substance;risk assessment;sulfonic acid derivative;toxicity;human;serum;clinical evaluation;newborn;young adult;carboxylic acid;polyfluoroalkyl substance;chemical analysis;placental transfer;prenatal exposure;Environmental engineering;detection method;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids;experimental study;pregnancy;Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids;concentration process;population exposure;maternal blood;umbilical cord blood;pregnant woman;family;Family;womens health;Fetus;alcohol derivative;fetus;Transplacental transfers;Non-target screenings;Confidence levels;human serum albumin;Environmental media;maternal serum screening test;Structure dependent,NA,NA

Until now, changes in the contaminant sorption capacity of MPs due to biofilm formation have not been quantified. This is the first study that compared the capacity of naturally aged, biofilm-covered microplastic fibers (BMFs) to adsorb perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and lead (Pb) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Changes in the surface properties and morphology of aged microplastic fibers (MF) were studied by surface area analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Results revealed that aged MFs exhibited higher surface areas because of biomass accumulation compared to virgin samples and followed the order polypropylene>polyethylene>nylon>polyester. The concentrations of adsorbed Pb and PFOS were 4-25% and 20-85% higher in aged MFs and varied among the polymer types. The increased contaminant adsorption was linked with the altered surface area and the hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics of the samples. Overall, the present study demonstrates that biofilms play a decisive role in contaminant-plastic interactions and significantly enhance the vector potential of MFs for toxic environmental contaminants.

The results showed that earthworm growth was generally inhibited. The antioxidant activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were initially activated and then inhibited. Reduced glutathione content was observed, and malondialdehyde content was elevated over the duration of the exposure. These results suggested that PFOS induced oxidative stress in earthworms. In addition, the values of olive tail moment, tail DNA% and tail length using SCGE showed similar frequency distributions and increased with increases in the PFOS concentration.

Poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have attracted increasing concerns in light of their potential ecotoxicological effects and ubiquitous occurrence in the aquatic environment. Knowledge about their influences on the microbial community, however, remains largely unknown. In the present study, Illumina high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA was applied to explore the changes in the dynamic and composition of the bacterial community upon exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) at different concentrations, i.e. 0.45 µg L−1, 130 µg L−1 and 5.0 mg L−1. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed variations of 57.2% for Principal Component 1 and 16.0% for Principal Component 2 of the total community. This clearly demonstrated changes in the bacterial community structure between the controls and PFOA-amended water samples. At the phylum level, the predominant bacteria in the original pond water included Proteobacteria (64.47%), Armatimonadetes (11.87%), Actinobacteria (10.81%), Bacteroidetes (6.36%), Chloroflexi (1.44%), Verrucomicrobia (0.61%) and Firmicutes (0.14%). The relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia decreased 26.5–38.8%, 40.5–70.7%, and 47.4–87.5%, respectively, upon PFOA exposure. By contrast, PFOA led to an obvious increase of Proteobacteria, by 12.5–18.6% and Chloroflexi by 19.1–74.4%. Results from this study provided the needed evidence that PFAS at high concentrations could affect the microbial community in a freshwater ecosystem.

Lipoprotein subclass concentrations in the VLDL and LDL range were significantly higher after MCFA than after linoleic acid intervention. In addition, LDL subclass concentrations were higher in lower body obese individuals. Differences in VLDL metabolism were found to occur in lipoprotein lipolysis and uptake, not production; MCFAs were elongated intensively, in contrast to linoleic acid.

However, little information is available on the presence and effects of PFOS in the terrestrial compartment. Therefore, we investigated in this project the risks for effects, bioaccumulation and potential mechanisms of activity of PFOS in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) that is an important worldwide pollinator in the terrestrial compartment of wildflowers and cultivated crops. The exposure to PFOS occurred orally via the drinking of treated sugar water in a wide range from 1 μg/l up to 10 mg/l, containing environmentally relevant as well as high concentrations, and this was done with use of microcolonies of B. terrestris in the laboratory. A chronic toxicity assay demonstrated high bumblebee worker mortality (up to 100%) with an LC 50 of 1.01 mg/l (R 2 = 0.98). In addition, PFOS posed strong detrimental reproductive effects, and these concerted with a dramatic reduction in ovarian size. HPLC-MS demonstrated a bioaccumulation factor of 27.9 for PFOS in bumblebee workers fed with sugar water containing 100 μg/l PFOS during 5 weeks (2184 ± 365 ng/g BW). Finally, potential mechanisms of activity were investigated to explain the significant impact of PFOS on survival and reproduction capacity of B. terrestris. Exposure of bumblebee workers to PFOS resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial electron transport activity (p = 0.035) and lipid amounts (p = 0.019), while the respective p-values were 0.58 and 0.12 for protein and glucose amounts. Hence, addition of PFOS to ecdysteroid responsive Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells resulted in a strong antagonistic action on the EcR-b.act.luc reporter construct, demonstrating that PFOS may exert its effects partially through an endocrine disrupting action via the insect molting hormone or ecdysteroid receptor. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,10.1007/s10646-011-0596-2,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Animals;environmental exposure;nonhuman;reproduction;Reproduction;controlled study;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;survival;protein;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;chronic toxicity;toxicity;article;priority journal;pollution effect;endocrine disruptor;glucose;insect cell;organic compound;Feeding Behavior;environmental impact;concentration (parameters);Hexapoda;Survival;Drosophila melanogaster;flower;Antagonistic activity;Apidae;bee;Bees;Bombus terrestris;bumblebee;Bumblebee;cultivated species;ecdysone receptor;ecdysteroid;Electron transport;Electron Transport;Energy content;Hymenoptera;Insecta;LC 50;mitochondrial energy transfer;Pollination;pollinator;worker (insect),NA,NA

The aim of this project was to investigate the possible effects of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg) on the thyroid hormone system, as expressed by circulating thyroid hormone (TH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, as well as the histology of the thyroid gland. Fifteen glaucous gulls were euthanized in Sassendalen and Adventfjorden in Svalbard during the pre-breeding period in April and May 2017. Samples were taken of plasma, feathers, liver, and thyroid gland. PFAS concentrations were quantified in the liver, whereas Hg concentrations were quantified in the liver, feathers, and plasma. TSH and total and unbound fraction of TH were quantified in plasma. As selenium (Se) plays a role both in activation and regulation of THs, and acts as a detoxifying agent for Hg, this element was analysed in the same tissues as Hg. The histology of the thyroid glands was examined for histological changes. Multivariate data analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between Hg, PFASs and thyroid response variables. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the dominating PFAS, accounting for 71 % of the PFAS load. Long-chained perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) constituted the remaining 29 % of the load, and there were no major differences between male and female glaucous gulls.

This pre-sampling isotope dilution method incorporates stable isotope internal standards (ISs) and surrogate recovery standards (SRSs) added to sample bottles prior to sample collection. Pre-sampling isotope dilution corrects for PFC adsorption losses and enables a simple quantitative DI-LC/MS/MS water method with a 28 day sample holding time. Method analytes include perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (C4-C12), perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) (C4, C6, and C8), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), and four SRSs ([2,3,4-C-13(3)]PFBA, [1,2,3,4-C-13(4)]PFOA, [1,2,3,4-C-13(4)]PFOS, and [1,2-C-13(2)]PFUnA). At 28 day sample holding times, mean recoveries of laboratory reagent water samples (Milli-Q (TM) water containing hardness at 165 mg equivalent CaCO3 L-1) fortified with the PFC method analytes at 0.2-40 ng mL(-1) (0.1-1 ng mL(-1) SRSs) are 94.9-115% with relative standard deviations of 0.97-7.9%. At 28 day sample holding times in fortified laboratory reagent water samples, single laboratory lowest concentration minimum reporting levels of 0.010-0.020 ng mL(-1) (0.075 ng mL(-1) PFBA) are demonstrated for method analytes and SRSs. Method applications to synthetic chlorinated drinking water samples and three environmental sample matrices are presented that demonstrate method ruggedness. Mean recoveries of synthetic chlorinated drinking water samples fortified with the PFC method analytes at 0.1-10 ng mL(-1) and SRSs at 0.1-1 ng mL(-1) are 97.8-113% with relative standard deviations of 2.0-18%.

By combining high volume injection with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultrahigh resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry, a sensitive (0.003-0.2 ng F/mL for model mass-labeled PFASs) untargeted workflow was developed for discovery and characterization of novel PFASs in water. In the first step, up to 5 mL of water is injected to in-line solid phase extraction, chromatographed by HPLC, and detected by electrospray ionization with mass spectral acquisition in parallel modes cycling back and forth: (i) full scan with ultrahigh resolving power (RP = 120,000, mass accuracy ≥3 ppm), and (ii) in-source fragmentation flagging scans designed to yield marker fragment ions including [C2F5]- (m/z 118.992), [C3F7]- (m/z 168.988), [SO4H]- (m/z 96.959), and [Cl]- (m/z 34.9). For flagged PFASs, plausible empirical formulas were generated from accurate masses, isotopic patterns, and fragment ions. In the second step, another injection is made to collect high resolution MS/MS spectra of suspect PFAS ions, allowing further confirmation of empirical formulas while also enabling preliminary structural characterization. The method was validated by applying it to an industrial wastewater, and 36 new PFASs were discovered. Of these, 26 were confidently assigned to 3 new PFAS classes that have not previously been reported in the environment: polyfluorinated sulfates (CnFn+3Hn-2SO4-; n = 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15), chlorine substituted perfluorocarboxylates (ClCnF2nCO2-; n = 4-11), and hydro substituted perfluorocarboxylates (HCnF2nCO2-; n = 5-16).

Analyses of trace metals and stable isotope ratios in size-fractionated aerosol particles using extraction experiments are useful to understand the dissolution behavior and biogeochemical cycles of trace metals in the marine environment. These analyses require sample treatments in clean environment without contamination of target metals from the sampling filter. However, the contamination of target metals from sampling filter is not low enough to determine the fractional solubility (extractive metal/total metal) and the stable isotope ratio of trace metals. In this study, we optimized the acid-washing procedure of hydrophobic PTFE filter for the Sierra-type cascade impactor. The results showed that the filter blanks of the custom-made PTFE filters used for the upper stages (= PTFE-ST) in the cascade impactor were about 10-1000 times lower than those of cellulose filters. In addition, the filter blanks of major ions and water-soluble organic carbon were also decreased by using PTFE-ST.

To assess the hepatotoxicity of these chemicals on females, each chemical was orally administered to female C57BL/6 mice at the dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/d for 28 d. The contribution of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα and γ) and other nuclear receptors involving in these toxic effects of GenX and its analogs were identified by employing two PPAR knockout mice (PPARα−/− and PPARγΔHep) in this study. Results showed that the hepatotoxicity of these chemicals increased in the order of GenX < PFDMOHxA < PFDMO2HpA < PFDMO2OA. The increases of relative liver weight and liver injury markers were significantly much lower in PPARα−/− mice than in PPARα+/+ mice after GenX analog exposure, while no significant differences were observed between PPARγΔHep and its corresponding wildtype groups (PPARγF/F mice), indicating that GenX analog induce hepatotoxicity mainly via PPARα instead of PPARγ. The PPARα-dependent complement pathways were inhibited in PFDMO2HpA and PFDMO2OA exposed PPARα+/+ mice, which might be responsible for the observed liver inflammation. In PPARα−/− mice, hepatomegaly and increased liver lipid content were observed in PFDMO2HpA and PFDMO2OA treated groups. The activated pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive activated receptor (CAR) pathways in the liver of PPARα−/− mice, which were highlighted by bioinformatics analysis, provided a reasonable explanation for hepatomegaly in the absence of PPARα. Our results indicate that GenX analogs could induce more serious hepatotoxicity than GenX whether there is a PPARα receptor or not.

Annual average concentrations of total PFOA and PFOS ranged from 0.026 to 0.112 µg L−1 (irrigation water), and from 0.818 to 1.364 µg kg−1 (soil), respectively. PFOA and PFOS hotspots were identified downstream of the Nakdong River and were influenced by seasonal climatic variations. The observed average biennial concentration of the sum of PFOA and PFOS decreased in irrigation water, from 0.112 µg L−1 in 2013 to 0.026 µg L−1 in 2015, suggests that the 2013 Persistent Organic Pollutants Control Act may have helped to reduce levels of PFAS at this location. This study calculated some of the highest plant uptake factors reported to date, with values ranging from 0.962 in green onions to < 0.004 in plums. Leafy vegetables and rice are important components of the Korean diet; these groups had the largest contribution to the estimated dietary intake of PFOA and PFOS, which was calculated at 0.449 and 0.140 ng kgbw−1 day−1, respectively. This corresponded to 66.4% for PFOA and 7.9% for PFOS of the EFSA reference dose (RfD). The dietary intake of PFOA and PFOS from crops alone did not exceed the RfD. However, when the estimated daily intake (EDI) from other sources such as tap water, meat, fish, dairy, and beverages was included in the exposure risk assessment, both of the EDIs to PFOA and PFOS exceeded the RfDs, indicating that there may be a risk to human health.

The physical and chemical properties of as-prepared MgAl-LDH and CLDH were examined by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The FT-IR results indicated that the as-prepared samples are the desired products and the structure of CLDH has recovered after adsorption of PFHxA. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed that the synthesized products have well-ordered layer structure and PFHxA can be removed from aqueous solution through entering interlayer of CLDH. The BET analysis verified the surface areas and pore size distributions of MgAl-LDH and CLDH, respectively. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis further proved the adsorption mechanism via element changes between CLDH before and after adsorption. For the adsorption experiment, the effects of the adsorption conditions including calcination, dosage, temperature and duration of oscillation have been investigated. The best removal efficiency of PFHxA by CLDH is 89.54%, which is provided by 0.1 g CLDH at 65°C for 30 min in 30 mL PFHxA solution with initial concentration of 0.3592 g/L. The adsorption kinetics of PFHxA by CLDH was studied. The kinetic data were well-fitted to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Based on FT-IR and kinetic analysis, the “memory effect” may play an important role in adsorption stage.

Negative ion dopant-assisted APPI using vapors of diethyl ether and a source temperature of 250 °C provided high ionization efficiencies and mass spectra characterized by intense in-source fragment ions as well as the presence of molecular ion and characteristic cluster ions containing oxygen atoms in their chemical structure. This made it possible to improve the selectivity in the determination of these compounds compared to that obtained with traditional GC-MS ion sources. Under optimized conditions, the sPLE GC-APPI-HRMS (Orbitrap) method provided high recoveries (> 91%), good precisions (RSD% < 12%), and low method limits of detection (0.1-3.5 pg g-1 wet weight). The developed methodology has been applied to the determination of DP and related compounds in eggs of two gull species (L. michahellis and L. audouinii) from several Spanish protected areas. The results obtained showed significant differences in the DP concentration profiles in eggs from different gull breeding locations and between gull species of the same protected area. These results demonstrated the good performance of the GC-APPI-HRMS system to achieve a selective and sensitive determination of DP and related compounds in complex environmental samples.",NA,10.1007/s00216-021-03286-8,Eggs;Birds;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Chromatography;Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry;Hydrocarbons;Charadriiformes;Environmental Pollutants;Gull eggs;dechlorane plus;analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Chlorinated;Liquid;Dechlorane Plus;Photochemical Processes;Atmospheric Pressure;0;Index Medicus;methods;Atmospheric pressure photoionization;Gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry;Polycyclic Compounds;Spanish Natural Parks;Ovum,NA,NA

In general, we found a very diverse PFAS pattern in the analysed media. PFAS level was higher in skiing areas compared to the non-skiing ones that were used as control. ∑target PFAS ranged between <1.7 ng L−1 and 143 ng L−1 in snowmelt, <0.62 ng g−1 and 5.35 ng g−1 in soil and <1.89 and 874 ± 240 ng g−1 in ski wax samples.

Concerns surrounding PFASs are principally due to their widespread occurrence in humans and the environment and links to adverse health effects. One of the lesser known uses for PFASs is in cosmetic products (CPs) which come into contact with the skin (e.g. hair products, powders, sunblocks, etc.). In the present work, thirty-one CPs from five product categories (cream, foundation, pencil, powder and shaving foam) were analyzed for 39 PFASs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, as well as extractable organic fluorine (EOF) and total fluorine (TF) by combustion ion chromatography (CIC). This multi-platform approach enabled determination of the fraction of fluorine accounted for by known PFASs (i.e. fluorine mass balance). Foundations and powders contained 25 different PFASs with the most frequently detected being perfluorinated carboxylic acids (perfluoroheptanoic acid and perfluorohexanoic acid) and polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs). Σ 14 PAP concentrations up to 470 μg g -1 were measured in products listing mixtures of PAPs as an ingredient. For all samples, Σ 39 PFAS concentrations only explained a small fraction of the EOF and TF, pointing to the presence of unknown organic and/or inorganic fluorinated substances, including polymers. While creams, pencil and shaving foams did not contain measurable concentrations of any of the 39 PFASs targeted here, CIC revealed high to moderate TF content.

In 2019, perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoic acid (HFPO-DA trade name GenX) were demonstrated to have an equivalent level of concern (ELoC) to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (PBT/vPvB) substances owing to their persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) substance properties and very persistent and very mobile (vPvM) substance properties, respectively. They were both subsequently identified as substances of very high concern (SVHC) applying Article 57(f) in REACH. This work follows up on this regulatory decision by presenting a science based, conceptual level comparison that all PMT/vPvM substances pose an ELoC to PBT/vPvB substances. Using the two cases named above, as well as 1,4-dioxane, 16 categories were developed to evaluate a) serious effects on human health, b) serious effects on the environment and c) additional effects. 1,4-dioxane has recently been proposed to be classified as Carcinogenic 1B by the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC). The aim was to enable an objective and scientifically justified conclusion that these classes of substances have an equivalent level of concern for the environment and human health. Results In all of the categories related to human health, the environment and other effects, the PMT/vPvM case study substances exhibited comparable effects to PBT/vPvB substances. A difference in the human and environmental exposure pathways of PMT/vPvM and PBT/vPvB substances exists as they vary temporally and spatially. However, effects and impacts are similar, with PMT/vPvM substances potentially accumulating in (semi-)closed drinking water cycles and pristine aquatic environments, and PBT/vPvB substances accumulating in humans and the food chain. Both PMT/vPvM and PBT/vPvB substances share the common difficulty that long term and long-range transport and risk of exposure is very difficult to determine in advance and with sufficient accuracy. Conclusion The registration process of substances under REACH should reflect that PMT/vPvM substances pose an equivalent level of concern to PBT/vPvB substances.",NA,10.1186/s12302-020-00440-4,character(0),NA,NA

A data set of 11 straight-chain PFAS in 139 samples of fish in the Great Lakes was analyzed using positive matrix factorization (PMF) to investigate their primary sources, whose spatial variations were examined against the surrounding environmental factors. PMF analysis produced five fingerprints. Factor 1 (72% of Σ11PFAS, dominated by PFOS) probably represented emissions from primary sources (such as consumer products) and secondary sources (precursors), and increased in average abundance from west to east across the Great Lakes. Factor 2 (13% of Σ11PFAS) and factor 3 (7% of Σ11PFAS), highly loaded with long-chain PFAS and PFNA, respectively, were thought to represent PVDF manufacture or processing in metal plating. They showed higher contributions in sparsely populated Lakes Superior and Huron. Factor 4 (5% of Σ11PFAS, highly loaded with PFOS and PFHxS) presented hot spots near current and former air force bases, suggesting it was related to aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs). Factor 5 (4% of Σ11PFAS) contained primarily PFOS and PFOSA, which may imply metabolism of precursors (PFOSA) to PFOS in vivo. Unexpectedly, the spatial trends of the five sources all showed abnormally low values near the more urbanized Chicago and Milwaukee in Lake Michigan, which may be due to their unique wastewater and stormwater infrastructure or may arise from atmospheric transport of precursors. Our study indicated that PMF was an effective tool to identify sources of PFAS in fish despite absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) processes which might alter fingerprints in fish relative to their surrounding environment. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118047,PFAS;Fish;Fluorocarbons;wastewater;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Spatial variations;United States;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;polychlorinated biphenyl;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;chemical substance;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;fish;geographic distribution;pollution exposure;perfluoroalkyl substance;source apportionment;environmental fate;water;atmospheric transport;metabolism;species difference;Great Lakes [North America];lacustrine environment;lake;Lake Superior;Lakes;Metabolism;Consumer products;lake water;Matrix algebra;spatial analysis;lake trout;Fishes;absorption;pollutant source;emission inventory;storm water;Water;statistical analysis;Lake Huron;Primary sources;Lake Michigan;Water Pollutants;excretion;lake ecosystem;Micropterus dolomieu;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha;Chemical;freshwater fish;Source apportionment;Factorization;Positive matrix factorization;Positive Matrix Factorization;Sander vitreus;Lake fishes;brominated diphenyl ether;Complex sources;Data set;environmental aspects;Great lakes;Highly loaded;Plating;positive matrix factorization;related phenomena;stormwater,NA,NA

Although the TMF has been recognized as the most reliable tool for assessing the biomagnification of organic contaminants, peer‐reviewed studies reporting TMFs for PFAS are few and with limited geographical distribution. We found 25 published studies of the biomagnification of 35 specific PFAS, for which the TMF was generated through linear regression of individual log‐PFAS concentration and the δ15N‐based trophic position of each organism in the food webs. Studies were concentrated mainly in China, North America, and Europe, and the most investigated compound was perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which was frequently shown to be biomagnified in the food web (TMFs ranging from 0.8 to 20). Other long‐chain carboxylates displayed substantial variation in trophic magnification. Observed differences in the TMF were associated with length of the food web, geographic location, sampling methodologies, tissue analyzed, and distance from known direct PFAS inputs. In addition to biomagnification of legacy PFAS, precursor substances were observed to bioaccumulate in the food web, which suggests they may biotransform to more persistent PFAS compounds in upper trophic levels. This review discusses the variability of environmental characteristics driving PFAS biomagnification in natural ecosystems and highlights the different approaches used by each study, which can make comparisons among studies challenging.

Here we studied the bioaccumulation kinetics and effects of two major PFCs, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid compound (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), in multixenobiotic transporter activity (MXR) and filtration and oxygen consumption rates in zebra mussel exposed to a range of concentrations of a PCF mixture (1-1,000 μg/L) during 10 days. Results indicate a low potential of the studied PFCs to bioaccumulate in zebra mussel tissues. PFCs altered mussel MXR transporter activity being inhibited at day 1 but not at day 10. Bioaccumulation kinetics of PFCs were inversely related with MXR transporter activity above 9 ng/g wet weight and unrelated at tissue concentration lower than 2 ng/g wet weight suggesting that at high tissue concentrations, these type of compounds may be effluxed out by MXR transporters and as a result have a low potential to be bioaccumulated in zebra mussels. Oxygen consumption rates but not filtering rates were increased in all exposure levels and periods indicating that at environmental relevant concentrations of 1 μg/L, the studied PFCs enhanced oxidative metabolism of mussels. Overall, the results obtained in this study confirm previous findings in the field indicating that an important fraction of PFC accumulated in mussel tissues is eliminated actively by MXR transporters or other processes that are metabolically costly. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",NA,10.1007/s11356-012-1158-8,Bioaccumulation;bioaccumulation;concentration (composition);Toxicity;Perfluorinated compounds;metabolism;bivalve;oxidation;oxygen consumption;fluorine;reaction kinetics;Dreissena polymorpha;Respiration;Mussel;Dreissena;Multixenobiotic resistance mechanism;respiration,NA,NA

This work systematically analyzed the occurrence and migration of typical veterinary antibiotics in organic vegetable bases, northern China. The results showed that there was no obvious geographical difference in antibiotic distribution between soil and manure. A simple migration model can be easy and quick to predict the accumulation of antibiotics in soil. Antibiotics were mainly taken up through water transport and passive absorption in vegetables. The distribution of antibiotics in a plant was in the sequence leaf > stem > root, and performed biological accumulation. The residues of antibiotics in all samples in winter were significantly higher than those in summer. Overall, this work can lay the foundation for understanding ecological risk of antibiotics and their potential adverse effects on human health by food chain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate effects by three model pollutants, oxybenzone (BP3), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) adsorbed to polyethylene MPs on the basis of a standard assay, the acute fish embryo toxicity test (FET; OECD TG 236) with zebrafish (Danio rerio) supplemented by additional endpoints such as induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, modification of cyp1a gene transcription and changes in larval swimming behavior. FET assays were performed in three laboratories using slightly different husbandry and exposure conditions, which, however, were all fully compatible with the limits defined by OECD TG 236. This allowed for testing of potential changes in the FET assay due to protocol variations. The standard endpoints of the FET (acute embryotoxicity) did not reveal any acute toxicity for both virgin MPs and MPs spiked with BP3, BaP, and PFOS. With respect to sublethal endpoints, EROD activity was increased after exposure to MPs spiked with BP3 (3 h pulse) and MPs spiked with BaP (96 h continuous exposure). Cyp1a transcription was increased upon exposure to MPs spiked with BP3 or BaP. For the selected combination of MPs particles and contaminants, the basic FET proved not sensitive enough to reveal effects of (virgin and spiked) MPs. However, given that the FET can easily be supplemented by a broad variety of more subtle and sensitive endpoints, an enhanced FET protocol may provide a relevant approach with developmental stages of a vertebrate animal model, which is not protected by current EU animal welfare legislation (Directive EU 2010/63). © Copyright © 2019 Cormier, Batel, Cachot, Bégout, Braunbeck, Cousin and Keiter.",NA,10.3389/fenvs.2019.00135,benzo[a]pyrene;perfluorooctane sulfonate;EROD;oxybenzone;cyp1a;fish embryotoxicity test (FET);swimming behavior,NA,NA

This information has been utilized to assess the importance of potential explanatory variables in determining the presence and concentration of PFAS in different regions. Nevertheless, the significance of these variables and the reliability of the methods in regions beyond where they were initially tested is still uncertain. Hence, our research pursues two main objectives: 1) to evaluate the validity of the aforementioned variables and methods for several PFAS species in a different area and 2) to build on existing modeling work; a new PFAS predictive model is introduced which is more reliable in determining the presence and concentration of PFAS at a regional level. To achieve these goals, we reconstructed four state-of-the-art models using a statewide dataset available for Michigan. These models involve spatial regression techniques, classification and regression random forest algorithms, and boosted regression trees. They also include numerous explanatory variables, such as features of local soil and hydrology and the number of nearby contamination sources. Then, we use a Bayesian selection approach to find the most relevant among these variables. Finally, we employ the most relevant covariates to assess PFAS occurrence and estimate their concentration using a novel combination of machine learning algorithms and conditional autoregressive (CAR) modeling. In the first case, PFAS occurrence was assessed with an accuracy comparable to the reconstructed models (>90%) while using significantly fewer variables. In the second case, by maintaining low data requirements, the estimated concentrations of most PFAS compounds were more closely aligned with available observations compared to previous methods, with correlation coefficients ρ > 0.90 and R2 > 0.77. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.watres.2023.120307,Fluorocarbons;Article;Michigan;United States;fluorocarbon;controlled study;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Regression analysis;land use;drinking water;Potable water;Drinking Water;assessment method;Forestry;reproducibility;Reproducibility of Results;public health;water resource;Correlation methods;Bayesian analysis;watershed;petrochemical industry;machine learning;Bayes theorem;Bayes Theorem;algorithm;correlation coefficient;Machine learning;Drinking water sources;Bayesian;Learning algorithms;large scale production;random forest;autocorrelation;available water capacity;binary classification;Boosted regression trees;Boosted Regression Trees;Conditional autoregressive;explanatory variable;Explanatory variables;hydraulic conductivity;hydrology;Large-scales;Machine Learning;PFAS compounds;Polyfluoroalkyl substance compound;predictive model;Random fore;Random Fores;spatial regression;sugar beet;Drinking,NA,NA

In this study, we systematically integrated the relevant data in the dataset, analyzed its contamination level using PI (single pollution index) and MPI (metal pollution index) models, and assessed health hazards of fish consumption using THQ (target hazard quotient) and ILCR (incremental lifetime cancer risk) models. Results showed that the contamination levels of heavy metals in fish varied in a feeding habit and living habit dependent manner. The risk of non-cancer health is the highest from consuming omnivorous fish, then from carnivorous and herbivorous fish. The ILCR model predicted that the long-term Taihu consumption of omnivorous fish may pose a potential carcinogenic risk, especially for children. In all, our study provided a comprehensive understanding on the risk of heavy metals in Taihu.

It is an ideal strategy for long-term monitoring of bioaccumulative contaminants. Bioindicator monitoring has been widely used; however, there were seldom detailed studies about bioindicator methodology in literature. The present study proposed a bioindicator framework suitable for the local conditions of China, including selection of bioindicator species, evaluation of impact factors, and derivation of threshold values using per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) as an example. The criteria that proper bioindicator species should meet and the procedure how the bioindicator species is selected were proposed, under which crucian carp (Carassius auratus) was selected as the local bioindicator for studied PFASs. Several factors which may affect accumulation of contaminants in bioindicators were suggested to produce reliable and comparable results. Derivation method of bioindicator thresholds for ecological risk assessment of aquatic ecosystems was firstly developed. The long-term and short-term ecological thresholds of perfluorooctanesulfonate using crucian carp as bioindicator are 3.329 and 1.402 mu g/g wet weight respectively. Using the long-term thresholds derived from chronic toxicity data and the accumulative concentrations of contaminants obtained by bioindicator results, the bioindicator monitoring can be used for long-term ecological risk surveillance. The threshold derivation method can extend the application of bioindicator monitoring from the occurrence study to ecological risk surveillance, which is especially important for China who has made progresses on regular contaminant control and starts to be concerned about the ecological risks of the emerging contaminants. The framework can be used to create national and regional long-term freshwater bioindicator monitoring programs, with the purposes of ecological risk assessment, occurrence and temporal trend study, pollution source identification, international convention fulfillment, retrospective study, etc. The bioindicator framework will benefit the aquatic environmental safety and the hazardous chemical management in China.",NA,10.1007/s11356-022-21223-9,China;Risk Assessment,NA,NA

To assess the effects of paclitaxel on the central nervous system, a sensitive and accurate method is required to quantify paclitaxel concentrations in plasma and brain tissue obtained from rodents receiving paclitaxel. METHODS: The biological samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction and separated by a 3.5min reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) method using a BDS Hypersil C8 column under isocratic conditions. Paclitaxel was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer working in the positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. A stable isotope labeled analogue of paclitaxel was used as the internal standard (IS). RESULTS: The method was validated to be precise and accurate within the dynamic range of 0.5-100ng/mL based on 100L plasma and 1.5-300ng/g based on 33mg of brain tissue in homogenate. This method was applied to samples from 2mg/kg intravenously dosed rats. The plasma concentrations were observed to be 26.62 +/- 8.93ng/mL and brain concentrations 11.08 +/- 4.18ng/g when measured 4h post-dose. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid LC/MS/MS method was validated to be sensitive, specific, precise and accurate for the quantification of paclitaxel in rat plasma and brain tissue homogenate. Application of the method to study samples provided sufficient proof of blood-brain barrier penetration of paclitaxel, allowing further investigation of its influence on the central nervous system.

In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) was exposed to nominal concentrations of PFOA (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1mg/L) for 21d. After exposure, each fish was decapitated, and the spleen was removed to detect the expression patterns of P65 transcription factor, myeloid differentiation 88, relative interleukins (ILs), and antibody genes. PFOA can stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine at a low exposure concentration (0.05. mg/L) and can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine at higher exposure concentrations (>0.1. mg/L). The results of linear correlation analysis indicate that Myd88/NF-κB pathway is one of the important pathways to mediate inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β and IL-21) in zebrafish spleen. Additionally, the relative mRNA expression level of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) at 1. mg/L PFOA group was decreased to 56% of its corresponding level in the control. IL secretion disorder is possibly closely related to PFOA-induced TLR2 damage in zebrafish spleen. Furthermore, data show that the trends of PFOA-induced IL secretion have a relationship with Ig-secreting trend. This study demonstrates that PFOA can affect IL expression level through NF-κB, and ILs have an important function in the mediation of Ig secretion. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.08.043,Female;Fluorocarbons;Immunotoxicity;Animals;Article;Immunoglobulins;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;protein;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;oxidative stress;metabolism;interleukin 4;hormone;zebra fish;cytokine;protein expression;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;Zebrafish;statistical model;immunity;correlation analysis;Linear Models;immunotoxicity;messenger RNA;immunoglobulin;decapitation;cyprinid;immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein;immunology;concentration (parameters);reactive oxygen metabolite;transcription factor RelA;immunoglobulin blood level;interleukin 6;intoxication;immunoglobulin E;interleukin 1beta;immunoglobulin M;immunoglobulin G;secretion;cytokine release;Poisoning;NF-kappa B;spleen;cytokine response;Immunoglobulin;immunoglobulin D;immunoglobulin Z;Interleukin;interleukin 21;interleukin derivative;Interleukins;myeloid differentiation factor 88;Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88;secretion (process);toll like receptor 1;toll like receptor 2;toll like receptor 3;Toll-Like Receptor 2,NA,NA

Primary extractions from wild boar tissues (liver, kidney, and lung) were performed with methanol at neutral, acidic, or alkaline conditions, or with methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) after ion-pairing with tetrabutylammonium (TBA) ions. A second purification step was chosen after comparing different solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (Oasis WAX, ENVI-Carb, HybridSPE Phospholipid) and various combinations thereof or dispersive SPE with C18 and ENVI-Carb material. The best extraction efficiencies of the liquid PFAA extraction from tissue homogenates were achieved with methanol alone (recoveries from liver 86.6-114.4%). Further purification of the methanolic extracts using dispersive SPE or Oasis WAX columns decreased recoveries of most PFAA, whereas using pairs of two SPE columns connected in series proved to be more efficient albeit laborious. Highest recoveries for ten out of eleven PFAA were achieved using ENVI-Carb columns (80.3-110.6%).

Moreover, the LC-Orbitrap Tribrid HRMS method could also benefit from its high mass resolution characteristic to eliminate potential environment interferents (e.g., taurodeoxycholate) and to quantify all PFSA isomers based on full-scan MS1 chromatogram at a narrow MS window (5 part per million). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.chroma.2016.01.039,Rivers;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Chromatography;Mass Spectrometry;Spectrometry;unclassified drug;analytic method;environmental monitoring;chemistry;water pollutant;LC-MS/MS;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;Phase separation;alkanesulfonic acid;liquid chromatography;procedures;solid phase extraction;Solid Phase Extraction;Chemical analysis;quantitative analysis;mass spectrometry;LC–MS/MS;priority journal;polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid;anion exchange;limit of detection;river;analysis;High resolution mass spectrometry;Isomers;concentration (parameters);High performance liquid chromatography;water analysis;Alkanesulfonates;surface water;Water Pollutants;Chromatographic analysis;Mass spectrometers;Chemical;qualitative analysis;measurement precision;Liquid;fluorotelomer sulfonic acid;Screening;perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid;Orbitrap;Water resources;Perfluoroalkyl sulfonates;fluoroalkylsulfonic acid;Fluorotelomer sulfonates;Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry;Riverine water;Riverine waters;Tribrid Orbitrap;Sulfones,NA,NA

However it was realized that due to their resistance to biodegradation perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid two of the most abundant PFAS were ubiquitous in various biological and environmental matrices and could biomagnify. These could effect human health and the (aquatic) environment.

Many POPs have been banned and conse-quently their environmental concentrations have declined. To assess both temporal trends of POPs and their detrimental impacts, raptors are extensively used as biomonitors due to their high food web position and high contaminant levels. White-tailed eagles (WTEs; Haliaeetus albicilla) in the Baltic ecosystem represent a sentinel species of environmental pollution, as they have suffered population declines due to reproductive failure caused by severe exposure to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) during the 1960s through 1980s. However, there is a lack of long-term studies that cover a wide range of environmental contaminants and their effects at the individual level. In this study, we used 135 pooled samples of shed body feathers collected in 1968-2012 from breeding WTE pairs in Sweden. Feathers constitute a temporal archive for substances incorporated into the feather during growth, including corticosterone, which is the primary avian glucocorticoid and a stress-associated hormone. Here, we analysed the WTE feather pools to investigate annual variations in feather corticosterone (fCORT), POPs (OCs and PBDEs), and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (SIs; dietary proxies). We examined whether the expected fluctuations in POPs affected fCORT (8-94 pg. mm-1) in the WTE pairs. Despite clear temporal declining trends in POP concentrations (p < 0.01), we found no sig-nificant associations between fCORT and POPs or SIs (p > 0.05 in all cases). Our results do not support fCORT as a relevant biomarker of contaminant-mediated effects in WTEs despite studying a highly contaminated popu-lation. However, although not detecting a relationship between fCORT, POP contamination and diet, fCORT represents a non-destructive and retrospective assessment of long-term stress physiology in wild raptors other-wise not readily available.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2023.115923,European Continental Ancestry Group,NA,NA

Various activated carbons (ACs) exhibit wide variability in adsorptive performance towards PFASs. In order to gain a systematic understanding of adsorptive removal of legacy and emerging PFASs by ACs, the adsorption of ten PFASs on various ACs was comprehensively investigated. Results showed that granular activated carbon-1 (GAC-1) and powdered activated carbon-1 (PAC-1) removed more than 90% of all target PFASs. Particle size, surface charge, and micropores quantity of ACs were closely related to their performance for PFASs removal. Electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, surface complexation and hydrogen bonding were the adsorption mechanisms, with hydrophobic interaction being the predominant adsorptive force. Physical and chemical adsorption were both involved in PFAS adsorption. The removal rates of PFASs by GAC-1 decreased from 93%–100% to 15%–66% in the presence of 5 mg/L fulvic acid (FA). GAC was able to remove more PFASs under acidic medium, whereas PAC removed hydrophobic PFASs better under the neutral medium. The removal rates of PFASs by GAC-3 increased significantly from 0%–21% to 52%–97% after being impregnated with benzalkonium chlorides (BACs), demonstrating the superiority of this modification method. Overall, this study provided theoretical support for removing PFASs from water phase with ACs. © 2023",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2023.116495,Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;Performance;Article;Adsorption;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;controlled study;bioaccumulation;chemical substance;chemistry;hydrogen bond;hydrophobicity;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Chlorine compounds;adsorption;water;polyfluoroalkyl substance;electrochemical analysis;particle size;Hydrophobicity;Activated carbon;polyfunctional group;Water;fulvic acid;complex formation;Water Pollutants;Hydrogen bonds;benzalkonium chloride;Chemical;static electricity;chemical interaction;perfluoroalkyl substances;Emerging polyfluoroalkyl substance;charcoal;pollutant removal;adsorption kinetics;Emerging PFAS;activated carbon;Adsorptive removal;bamboo;benzalkonium;Benzalkonium chloride;Benzalkonium chlorides;Charcoal;chemisorption;coal;coconut;complexation;granular activated carbon 1;Granular activated carbons;Hydrophobic interactions;Impregnation;nutshell (structure);Particle size;Particles sizes;Powdered activated carbon;powdered activated carbon 1;Removal rate;surface charge,NA,NA

Among the known cardiometabolic risk factors are compounds that induce endocrine and metabolic dysfunctions, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). To date, how EDCs influence molecular programs and cardiometabolic risks has yet to be fully elucidated, especially considering the complexity contributed by species-, chemical-, and dose-specific effects. Moreover, different experimental and analytical methodologies employed by different studies pose challenges when comparing findings across studies. To explore the molecular mechanisms of EDCs in a systematic manner, we established a data-driven computational approach to meta-analyze 30 human, mouse, and rat liver transcriptomic datasets for 4 EDCs, namely bisphenol A (BPA), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), tributyltin (TBT), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Our computational pipeline uniformly re-analyzed pre-processed quality-controlled microarray data and raw RNAseq data, derived differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological pathways, modeled gene regulatory networks and regulators, and determined CMD associations based on gene overlap analysis. Our approach revealed that DEHP and PFOA shared stable transcriptomic signatures that are enriched for genes associated with CMDs, suggesting similar mechanisms of action such as perturbations of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling and liver gene network regulators VNN1 and ACOT2. In contrast, TBT exhibited highly divergent gene signatures, pathways, network regulators, and disease associations from the other EDCs. In addition, we found that the rat, mouse, and human BPA studies showed highly variable transcriptomic patterns, providing molecular support for the variability in BPA responses. Our work offers insights into the commonality and differences in the molecular mechanisms of various EDCs and establishes a streamlined data-driven workflow to compare molecular mechanisms of environmental substances to elucidate the underlying connections between chemical exposure and disease risks. © 2023 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2023.108339,Humans;exposure;Animals;Article;Liver;Gene Expression Profiling;Transcriptome;Genes;Mice;Rats;Phenols;Cardiovascular Diseases;animal;nonhuman;mouse;perfluorooctanoic acid;gene;risk;Cytology;liver;human;disease association;metabolism;endocrine disruptor;Endocrine Disruptors;phenol derivative;tributyltin;rat;cardiovascular disease;genetic analysis;gene expression profiling;public health;Endocrine disrupters;Endocrine disrupting chemicals;transcriptomics;meta analysis;meta-analysis;transcriptome;Benzhydryl Compounds;benzhydryl derivative;microarray analysis;Bisphenol A;4;4' isopropylidenediphenol;Meta-analysis;phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester;Quality control;Molecular mechanism;metabolic disorder;Transcriptomics;data base;disease;computer analysis;Diethylhexyl Phthalate;workflow;ACOT2 gene;biological pathway;Bisphenols-A;cardiometabolic disease;Cardiometabolic disease;differential gene expression;Disease associations;gene function;gene network analysis;Gene networks;gene overlap analysis;gene regulatory network;Gene Regulatory Networks;gene set enrichment analysis;network analysis;Network analysis;pathway enrichment analysis;PPAR signaling;RNA sequence;Transcriptomes;VNN1 gene;weighted key driver analysis,NA,NA

In order to evaluate the adverse effects of PFOS in sediments, the toxic effects of PFOS in sediments on benthic organisms, including Chironomus kiiensis, Hyalella azteca and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, were investigated using mortality and growth-inhibition as toxic endpoints. Based on the results of toxicity experiments and collected toxicity data from the references, the sediment quality criteria (SQC) of PFOS was derived by species sensitivity distributions (SSD). Based on the obtained SQCs of PFOS, the ecological risk of PFOS in the sediments of seven major river systems in China was evaluated. The results showed that: (1) The toxic effect of PFOS on Chironomus kiiensis was the most significant, and the LC50 values were 0.894, 0.770 and 0.536 μg/g for the 96 h, 10 d and 21 d toxicity tests, respectively. No death was observed in the 10 d toxicity test (maximum concentration 156.5 μg/g) of the Hyalella azteca, while the LC50 was 70.5 μg/g in the 21 d toxicity test. As Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri was used, no significant death occurred in the 10 d toxicity test (maximum concentration 112.4 μg/g) and 21 d toxicity test (maximum concentration 76.4 μg/g). (2) The CMCsed was 28.6 μg/g and the CCCsed was 0.060 μg/g. (3) The w(PFOS) was lower than CCCsed in the sediments of 96% of China's seven major river systems, while the w(PFOS) was higher than CCCsed but lower than CMCsed in other sediments, which was mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In conclusion, the overall risk of PFOS in the sediments of the seven major river systems in China is relatively low, but the PFOS in the sediments of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River may have potential risks and need more attention. © 2019, Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

It was found that PFHxS, instead of PFOS or PFOA, was predominant both in the Lake and rivers (45.9–351 ng/L), reflecting increasing demand of PFHxS in recent years. The riverine flux of PFASs into the Lake was estimated to be 1255 kg/year. The percentage of linear (n-) PFOS and the ratio of 3 + 5m-/1m-PFOS were combined to indicate indirect source due to biodegradation of PFOS-precursors. The percentage order of n-PFOS was: the Lake (48.7%) < the flow-in rivers (59.2%) < ECF product (70.3%). While the ratio of 3 + 5m-/1m-PFOS was in reverse order: the Lake (11.9) > the rivers (8.99) > ECF (electrochemical fluorination) product (6.76). These suggested that degradation of PFOS-precursors made distinct contribution to PFOS load in the waters, particularly in the Lake. The Lake and river waters had a consistent proportion of n-PFHxS (89.0%), which was slightly lower than the ECF product (96.0%), indicating it was mainly due to the release from production and application of PFHxS as an active ingredient. © 2017",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.235,Rivers;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;China;Lakes;Isomers;Perfluorooctanoate;Biodegradation;Taihu Lake;Taihu lakes;Source tracing;Flux;Electrochemical fluorination;Fluxes;Active ingredients;Flow-in rivers,NA,NA

In this study, we measured concentrations and fate of several PASs in six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in New York State. We also monitored and measured matrix effects (ionization suppression and enhancement) by postcolumn infusion and standard additions. Concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) in effluents of the six WWTPs ranged from 58 to 1050 ng/L. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was also ubiquitous in effluents of these WWTPs, albeit at much lower concentrations (3-68 ng/L). Two of these WWTPs employed identical treatment processes, with similar hydraulic retentions, but differed only in that Plant B treated domestic and commercial waste, whereas Plant A had an additional industrial influence. We found that this industrial influence resulted in significantly greater mass flows of all of the PASs analyzed. Primary treatment was found to have no effect on the mass flows of PASs. Secondary treatment by activated sludge in Plant A significantly increased (p < 0.05) the mass flows of PFOS, PFOA, perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFOA), and perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA). However, in Plant B, only the mass flow of PFOA was significantly increased. The observed increase in mass flow of several PASs may have resulted from biodegradation of precursor compounds such as fluorotelomer alcohols, which is supported by significant correlations in the mass flow of PFOA/PFNA and PFOA/PFUnOA. Furthermore, the masses of PFOA and PFUnOA were significantly correlated only after the secondary treatment. In Plant A, concentrations of odd-number PFCAs were greater than those of even-number PFCAs, and concentration decreased with increasing chain length (from C8 to C12). A different pattern was observed in sludge samples, in which the dominance of PFOA decreased, and PFOA and PFUnOA increased, suggesting preferential partitioning of longer-chain PFCAs to sludge. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/es051798v,effluent;Surface-Active Agents;Chromatography;High Pressure Liquid;United States;unclassified drug;pollutant;perfluoro compound;perfluorooctanoic acid;surfactant;high performance liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;quantitative analysis;environmental fate;article;perfluorodecanoate;Surface active agents;ionization;Sewage;sludge;waste water;Wastewater treatment;Wastewater treatment plants;industry;waste water treatment plant;sampling;extraction;biodegradation;Effluents;Correlation methods;perfluoroundecanoate;Concentration (process);Industrial Waste;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Sewage treatment plants;Sewage sludge;perfluorooctanesulfonate;Sensitivity;Specificity;Perfluoroalkyl surfactants;Commercial waste;perfluorononanoate;Postcolumn infusion,NA,NA

This study investigated whether fish with high body burden levels of PFASs in the Twin Cities Metro Areas showed any evidence of adverse effects at the level of the transcriptome. We hypothesized that fish with higher body burden levels of PFASs would exhibit molecular responses in the liver and testis that were suggestive of oxidative and general stress, as well as impaired reproduction. Concentrations of PFASs in largemouth bass varied significantly across the sampled lakes, with the lowest concentrations of PFASs found in fish from Steiger and Upper Prior Lakes and the highest concentrations found in fish from Calhoun and Twin Lakes. Largemouth bass with high PFAS concentrations exhibited changes in the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, energy production, RNA processing, protein production/degradation and contaminant detoxification, all of which are consistent with biomarker responses observed in other studies with PFASs. However, given the wide range of genes that were differentially expressed across the lakes and the variability observed in the mechanisms through which biological processes were affected, it is unlikely that PFASs are the only stressors affecting largemouth bass in the Twin Cities Metro Areas lakes. Indeed, Twin Lake is affected by the Joslyn superfund site which contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pentachlorophenol, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins.

Even hydroxyl radical based processes are not capable to degrade these compounds. Sulfate radicals can oxidize a group of PFC, i.e., perfluorinated carboxylic (PFCAs) acids. However, information in literature on kinetics and reaction mechanism is largely based on model simulations which are prone to errors. The present study provides mechanistic insights based on product formation, material balances, competition kinetics experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, energy requirements for sulfate radical based degradation of PFCA is evaluated in the present study. PFCAs can be partly mineralized in chain reactions initiated by sulfate radicals (SO4[rad]─). The perfluorinated acetic acid (TFA), propionic acid, and butanoic acid are largely degraded in a primary reaction with sulfate radicals. In case of PFCA with a chain length of > 4 carbons low yields of PFCA products were observed. Regarding reaction kinetics sulfate radicals react very slow with PFCAs (≈ 104 M−1 s−1). Thus, the energy demand required for generation of SO4[rad]─ by photolysis of S2O82─ (UV/S2O82−) is very high.

Such models can be used to predict the toxicity of PPCPs to a particular species using available experimental toxicity data from a different species, thus reducing the tests on organisms of higher trophic level.

However, the joint effects of HMs and PFAAs on plant roots are not well clarified. This study explored the root uptake and acropetal translocation behaviors of C2–C8 PFAAs by wheat (Triticum acstivnm L.) under the co-exposure of copper (Cu). The underlying uptake mechanisms of PFAAs were verified in a defective root system. The results showed that excessive Cu (100–400 μmol/L) damaged the cell membrane of wheat root to increase electrolytic leakage. In the defective root system, the root concentrations of PFAAs decreased by 6%–73% and the decrease rates were negatively associated with the carbon chain length of PFAAs. Along with the decrease in root concentrations of PFAAs, the amount of ultrashort-chain (C2–C3) and short-chain (C4–C6) PFAAs translocated to the shoot also decreased by 45%–84%. In contrast, the acropetal translocation of long-chain (C8) PFAAs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perﬂuorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), was enhanced under Cu exposure due to the increase in root permeability as observed by increased electrolytic leakage. The shoot concentrations of PFOA and PFOS under Cu exposure were up to 5.5 and 11 times higher than those in the control, respectively. These results suggested that PFOA and PFOS could enter wheat root more easily through the breaks caused by Cu exposure and thereby their acropetal transportation to shoot was enhanced. Therefore, the risk of plant accumulation of long-chain PFAAs can be potentially underestimated if without considering the co-contamination with HMs in the environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116550,Perfluoroalkyl acids;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Article;Fertilizers;Heavy;Metals;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;carbon;Carbon;controlled study;water pollutant;Heavy metals;chemical compound;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);alkanesulfonic acid;Triticum;wheat;risk assessment;Cytology;copper;heavy metal;cell membrane permeability;pollution;Sewage;biological uptake;Copper;cell membrane;Chain length;sewage;Carbon-chain length;Water Pollutants;Chemical;plant growth;plant root;Joint effect;translocation;shoot;Uptake mechanism;hydroponics;electrolyte;Irrigation;Acropetal translocation;Effect of coppers;electrokinesis;irrigation;Land applications;leakage;Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs);root system;Sewage irrigation;Surface environments;Triticum acstivnm;Wheat root uptake,NA,NA

The Arctic area encompassed extended from Alaska, USA in the west to northern Scandinavian in the east, with data gaps for Arctic Russia and Arctic Finland. The aim was to investigate whether temporal trends for different animal groups and matrices were consistent across a larger geographical area. In general, legacy POPs showed decreasing concentrations over the last two to three decades, which were most pronounced for α-HCH and least pronounced for HCB and β-HCH. Few time-series of legacy POPs showed increasing trends and only at sites suspected to be influenced by local source. The brominated flame retardant congener BDE-47 showed a typical trend of increasing concentration up to approximately the mid-2000s followed by a decreasing concentration. A similar trend was found for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). These trends are likely related to the relatively recent introduction of national and international controls of hexa- and hepta-BDE congeners and the voluntary phase-out of PFOS production in the USA in 2000. Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) was the only compound in this study showing a consistent increasing trend. Only 12% of the long-term time-series were able to detect a 5% annual change with a statistical power of 80% at α < 0.05.

The bioaccumulation, distribution, elimination, and toxic effects of TBBPA and PFOS on thick-shell mussels (Mytilus unguiculatus V.), with the absence and presence of humic acid (HA), a typical DOM, were studied. The results showed that the uptake of TBBPA decreased and the uptake of PFOS increased when exposed to 1 mg/L HA. However, at higher concentrations of HA (5 and 25 mg/L), the opposite effect was observed. Combined exposure to HA, TBBPA, and PFOS resulted in oxidative stress in the digestive gland, with the severity of stress dependent on exposure time and HA dose. Histological analysis revealed a positive correlation between HA concentration and tissue damage caused by TBBPA and PFOS.

For sludge, samples from 2012 and 2014 were analyzed as well. Levels of precursors in sludge exceeded those of perfluoroalkyl acids and sulfonic acids (PFCAs and PFSAs), in 2015 the sum of polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid esters (PAPs) were 15–20 ng/g dry weight, the sum of fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (FTSAs) was 0.8–1.3 ng/g, and the sum of perfluorooctane sulfonamides and ethanols ranged from non-detected to 3.2 ng/g. Persistent PFSAs and PFCAs were detected at 1.9–3.9 ng/g and 2.4–7.3 ng/g dry weight, respectively.

Exposure to insecticides is a serious environmental problem owing to their cytotoxic effects in humans and animals. Reproductive toxicity of various organofluorine insecticides have been shown in previous studies. However, few studies have evaluated the toxicity of etoxazole in mammals. We aimed to examine the toxic effects of etoxazole in porcine trophectoderm (pTr) and uterine luminal epithelial (pLE) cells. To estimate the effects of etoxazole, we conducted assays after treatment with multiple concentration of etoxazole (0, 2, 4, 6 and 9 μM) to pTr and pLE cells for 0–72 h. Etoxazole decreased the cell proliferation, viability, and migration of pTr and pLE cells. Further, etoxazole induced apoptosis via cell cycle arrest and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. We also found that pro-apoptotic proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-response proteins were activated in response to etoxazole. Finally, we observed that etoxazole altered the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways and the mRNA expression of genes associated with implantation. Collectively, these results suggest that etoxazole disrupts normal cellular physiology and might cause early implantation failure. A schematic diagram illustrating the mode of action of etoxazole in pTr and pLE cells. Etoxazole reduced cell proliferation with attenuation of PCNA expression and induced cell cycle arrest via inhibition of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1. In addition, expression of receptors associated with implantation capability were decreased by etoxazole. Moreover, etoxazole depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential leading to release of proapoptotic proteins. ER stress-response proteins including GRP78, ATF6α, PERK, and eIF2α were activated by etoxazole. Furthermore, etoxazole altered the signal transduction pathway including PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Consequently, etoxazole induced disruption of cell physiology, which might lead to implantation failure in pTr and pLE cells.

PFASs consist of fluorinated carbon chains of varying length, terminal groups, and have a number of industrial uses. A previous zebrafish study from our laboratory showed that acute (3–120 h post fertilization, 0.02–2.0 μM), waterborne embryonic exposure to these chemicals resulted in chemical specific alterations at 5 days post fertilization (dpf), and some effects persisted up to 14 dpf. Using a gene battery consisting of 100 transcripts identified several genes that were up or down regulated. This current study looks at the long-term impacts of PFASs in adult zebrafish using the same exposure regimen. It was hypothesized that sub-lethal exposure of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), or perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOA) in embryonic zebrafish (3–120 hpf) would result in permanent morphometric, gene expression, and behavioral changes in adult fish similar to those observed at 5 and 14 dpf. Zebrafish were exposed to PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA (Control 0 μM, 2.0 μM) for the first five days post fertilization. At six months post fertilization, no PFAS treatment resulted in a significant change in total body length or weight. In terms of behavior, PFNA males showed a reduction in total distance traveled and time of immobility, and an increase in thigmotaxis behavior, aggressive attacks, and preference for the bright section of the tank. PFOS treated males had a reduced aggression behavior, and PFOA females preferred the dark section of the tank. Gene expression of slco2b1, slco1d1, and tgfb1a were analyzed because these transcripts were previously found to be affected by PFAS exposure in 5dpf and 14 dpf zebrafish and resulted in: significant decrease in expression of slco2b1 for both sexes in PFNA and PFOS treated groups, significant decrease of slco1d1 in all treatment groups for females and PFOS and PFOA exposed males, significant increase of tgfb1a in males treated with PFOS and PFNA, and a significant increase of bdnf in all PFAS male groups. This study demonstrates that acute, embryonic exposure (5 days) to individual PFASs result in significant biochemical and behavioral changes in young adult zebrafish 6 months after exposure. These three PFASs have long term and persistent impacts following short term embryonic exposure that persists into adulthood. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.09.011,PFAS;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;chemical pollutant;Animals;Article;Body Weight;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;sex difference;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;gene expression;toxicity;embryo development;embryo;young adult;body weight;growth;priority journal;perfluorononanoic acid;zebra fish;protein expression;morphometry;PFOA;Gene Expression;Zebrafish;animal behavior;nonmammalian embryo;cyprinid;Danio rerio;drug effects;behavioral response;locomotion;aging;behavior;PFNA;Embryo;sublethal effect;Water Pollutants;body height;fertilization;Animal;aggression;development;Locomotion;Chemical;body size;Behavior;Nonmammalian;morphometrics;Zebrafish locomotion;adulthood;behavior change;binding proteins;Body Size;brain derived neurotrophic factor;carrier proteins;immobility;organic anion transporter B;place preference;protein slco1d1;thigmotaxis behavior;transforming growth factor beta1;transforming growth factor beta1a;Zebrafish behavior,NA,NA

This reduced PFAS exposure via food and thus risk towards flamingos during the first years after the fires. Although the sediment is still polluted with persistent PFAS, flamingos returned, and started to feed on organisms with PFAS levels that exceed safety thresholds, placing the birds and other wildlife at risk.

Unlike neutral hydrophobic organic pollutants, many PFASs are ionic and have been hypothesized to accumulate in both phospholipids and protein-rich tissues. Here we investigate the role of phospholipids for PFAS accumulation by analyzing associations among concurrent measurements of phospholipid, total protein, total lipid, and 24 PFASs in the heart, muscle, brain, kidney, liver, blubber, placenta, and spleen of North Atlantic pilot whales (Globicephala melas). The sum of 24 PFASs (-24 PFAS) was highest in the liver [median of 260 ng g-1 interquartile range (IQR) of 216-295 ng g-1] and brain (86.0 ng g-1 IQR of 54.5-91.3 ng g-1), while phospholipid levels were highest in the brain. The relative abundance of PFASs in the brain greatly increases with carbon-chain lengths of ≥10, suggesting shorter-chain compounds may cross the blood-brain barrier less efficiently. Phospholipids were significant predictors of the tissue distribution of the longest-chain PFASs: perfluorodecanesulfonate (PFDS), perfluorododecanoate (PFDoA), perfluorotridecanoate (PFTrA), and perfluorotetradecanoate (PFTA) (rs = 0.5-0.6). In all tissues except the brain, each 1 mg g-1 increase in phospholipids led to a 12-25% increase in the concentration of each PFAS.

However, although they have been detected in surface water and human blood, their toxicities on aquatic organisms remain unknown. We used zebrafish embryos to compare the developmental toxicities of various PFECAs (e.g., perfluoro (3,5,7-trioxaoctanoic) acid (PFO3OA), perfluoro (3,5,7,9-tetraoxadecanoic) acid (PFO4DA), and perfluoro (3,5,7,9,11-pentaoxadodecanoic) acid (PFO5DoDA)) with that of PFOA and to further reveal the key events related to toxicity caused by these chemicals. Results showed that, based on half maximal effective concentrations (EC50), toxicity increased in the order: PFO5DoDA > PFO4DA > PFOA > PFO3OA, with uninflated posterior swim bladders the most frequently observed malformation. Similar to PFOA, PFECA exposure significantly lowered thyroid hormone (TH) levels (e.g., T3 (3,5,3′-L-triiodothyronine) and T4 (L-thyroxine)) in the whole body of larvae at 5 d post-fertilization following disrupted TH metabolism. In addition, the transcription of UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family a, b (ugt1ab), a gene related to TH metabolism, increased dose-dependently. Exogeneous T3 or T4 supplementation partly rescued PFECA-induced posterior swim bladder malformation. Our results further suggested that PFECAs primarily damaged the swim bladder mesothelium during early development. This study is the first to report on novel emerging PFECAs as thyroid disruptors causing swim bladder malformation. Furthermore, given that PFECA toxicity increased with backbone OCF2 moieties, they may not be safer alternatives to PFOA. © 2019 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2019.105317,Fluorocarbons;Surface waters;Animals;Article;Carboxylic Acids;Thyroid Hormones;Ethers;animal;female;fluorocarbon;Hormones;liothyronine;male;nonhuman;thyroid hormone;thyroxine;unclassified drug;controlled study;water pollutant;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;concentration (composition);surfactant;toxicity;Toxicity;drug effect;embryology;developmental toxicity;embryo;carboxylic acid;carboxylic acid derivative;priority journal;endocrine disruptor;hormone;zebra fish;toxicity testing;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;Carboxylic acids;genetic transcription;Zebrafish;Metabolism;ether derivative;nonmammalian embryo;embryotoxicity;cyprinid;Danio rerio;toxic concentration;Developmental toxicity;developmental stage;perfluoropolyether;Perfluoropolyethers;EC50;congenital malformation;Aquatic organisms;Embryo;Water Pollutants;fertilization;thyroid disease;Chemical;5;7;larva;Nonmammalian;9;swim bladder;11 pentaoxadodecanoic);7 trioxaoctanoic) acid;9 tetraoxadecanoic) acid;b;bladder;glucuronosyltransferase;mesothelium;perfluoro (3;perfluoropolyether carboxylic acid derivative;Perfluoropolyether carboxylic acids;Swim bladders;Thyroid disruptors;thyroid hormone metabolism;Transcription;UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family a;ugt1ab gene;Urinary Bladder;Thyroid Gland,NA,NA

They can serve as good sentinels for monitoring a large variety of contaminants in marine ecosystems. In this context, a multi-residue analytical method has been validated and applied to Holothuria tubulosa specimens and marine sediments for the determination of 36 organic compounds, which belong to some of the most problematic groups of emerging and priority pollutants (perfluoroalkyl compounds, estrogens, parabens, benzophenones, plasticizers, surfactants, brominated flame retardants and alkylphenols). Lyophilization of samples prior to solvent extraction and clean-up of extracts with C18, followed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis, is proposed. A Box–Behnken design was used for optimization of the most influential variables affecting the extraction and clean-up steps. For validation, matrix-matched calibration and recovery assay were applied. Linearity (% r2) higher than 99%, recoveries between 80% and 114% (except in LAS and NP1EO), RSD (precision) lower than 15% and limits of quantification between 0.03 and 12.5 ng g−1 dry weight (d.w.) were achieved. The method was applied to nine samples of Holothuria collected along the coast of Granada (Spain), and to marine sediments around the animals. The results demonstrated high bioaccumulation of certain pollutants.

Biphasic correlations of log Kd and log P, molecular weight, and numbers of rings (r2 = 0.63–0.66, p < 0.01) were observed for PAHs, suggesting that hydrophobicity might not facilitate adsorption of super-hydrophobic PAHs onto activated sludge. 63–69% of detected ECs were effectively removed by two textile WWTPs with removal efficiencies ≥ 80%, which were much higher than previous reports. Fenton processing enhanced the removal efficiencies for long-chain PFAS rather than short-chain PFAS. The PAEs and EDCs posed a medium-to-high risk to aquatic organisms and were screened as the priority ECs.

However, there is a paucity of information regarding their bioaccumulation ability and hazard characterization. Here, we explored the accumulation and hepatotoxicity of four PFECA compounds (HFPO-DA, HFPO-TA, PFO4DA, and PFO5DoDA) in comparison to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) after chronic low-dose exposure in mice. Except for HFPO-DA, the levels of all tested PFAS in the liver exceeded that in serum. High molecular weight PFECA compounds (PFO5DoDA and HFPO-TA) showed stronger accumulation capacity and longer half-lives (t1/2) than low molecular weight PFECA compounds (HFPO-DA and PFO4DA) and even legacy PFOA. Although hepatomegaly is a common apical end point of PFAS exposure, the differentially expressed gene (DEG) profiles in the liver suggested significant differences between PFOA and the four PFECA compounds. Gene enrichment analysis supported a considerable inhibitory effect of PFECA, but not PFOA, on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling pathway. Both HFPO-TA and PFO5DoDA demonstrated a more pronounced ability to perturb RNA expression profiles in vivo and to suppress GR signaling in vitro compared to HFPO-DA and PFO4DA. Calculated reference doses (RfDs) emphasized the potential hazard of PFECA to human health.

The large discrepancy between this large number and the few PFASs usually monitored suggest that environmental exposure might be substantially underestimated. This study applied a workflow, which included analysis of total fluorine (TF), extractable organofluorine (EOF), 24 target PFASs and suspect screening. The workflow aimed to close the organofluorine mass balance and to tentatively identify overlooked PFASs in various matrices from an aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) contaminated pond and its adjacent riparian zone. PFAS target analysis revealed that water, aquatic invertebrates as well as emergent aquatic insects had high concentrations with up to 2870 ng L−1, 9230 ng g−1 dry weight (dw) and 1470 ng g−1 dw ∑24PFASs, respectively. The EOF mass balance could be explained by target PFAS analysis for most biota samples such as aquatic invertebrates, emergent aquatic insects and terrestrial spiders and earthworms (i.e. EOF ≈ ∑24PFASs). In the pond surface water, 42–58% of the EOF was not explained by target PFASs. However most new tentatively identified PFASs (n = 25) were detected in water, which could contribute to the unknown EOF. Nine suspects could be further identified, which where perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide-based compounds and derivatives that all have been found in historical AFFFs produced by electrochemical fluorination.

In this study, the effect of various cooking methods (boiling, steaming, grilling and frying) on the levels of PFASs in fish muscle and the intake of PFASs was explored by using grass carp collected from Tangxun Lake, Wuhan, China. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant PFASs in raw fish fillets, with the concentrations ranging from 59.6 to 136 ng/g ww, followed by perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) (7.73–51.9 ng/g ww). The concentrations of long-chain PFASs in fish increased after cooking, while those of short-chain PFASs decreased. The amounts of PFASs in the cooked fish fillets decreased except PFOS. Short-chain PFASs, including PFBS and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), were dominant in cooking juice. The highest amounts of PFBS in the juices were observed after boiling and frying, even higher than those in cooked fish fillets, suggesting that the release of short-chain PFASs to the cooking juices could not be neglected. Based on these results, the intake of short-chain PFASs amount through cooked fish fillets slightly decreased, but the intake of PFOS amount increased. However, consumption of cooking juice (fish soup) could increase the exposure risk of PFBS. Comprehensively considering the increase of PFOS and decrease of total PFASs, boiling may be the relatively better method to cook fish. As PFASs are ubiquitous and inevitable in aquatic food, it is thus important to choose appropriate cooking processes and dietary habits for reducing the intake of different PFASs from fish. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111003,"Fish;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;China;animal;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal tissue;chemistry;water pollutant;chemical compound;fish;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);perfluoroalkyl substance;procedures;human;dietary exposure;Dietary Exposure;polyfluoroalkyl substance;perfluoroheptanoic acid;metabolism;perfluorobutane sulfonate;lake;Lakes;food consumption;cooking;Cooking;frying;carp;Carps;sea food;Seafood;absorption;evaporation;leaching;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);grass carp;moisture;dissolution;boiling;Ctenopharyngodon;grilling;Hubei;Intake;steaming;Tangxun Lake;Sterilization, Tubal;Poaceae",NA,NA

After solid phase extraction, 49 samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LOD ≤ 1.5 ng L−1). The PFOA and PFOS present in all samples at the highest concentration were found in the Ennore coastal region (reaching a maximum of 24.8 ng L−1 and 13.9 ng L−1 in CH-6 and CH-14 respectively). Similarly, on the West Bengal coast, concentrations of PFOA ranged from <1.5 to 14.0 ng L−1 and <1.3 to 8.2 ng g−1 in water and sediment respectively. PFOS concentrations in water and sediment ranged from <1.2 to 9.0 ng L−1 and <1.2 to 7.9 ng g−1, respectively.

However, GC-FID does not allow profiling of FA synthesis and metabolism using stable isotopes. Here we present a rapid and sensitive GC-MS method for determination of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Fatty acid methylation was carried out by transesterification with acetyl-chloride and methanol. FAME separation applies a short and polar cyano-column resulting in an analysis time of 17.2 min. Separation was achieved for positional and geometrical (cis/trans) isomers with chain lengths between C8 and C28. Partial overlap of FAMEs (e.g. for C20:2 (n-6) and C21:0) could be resolved using selected ion monitoring (SIM). The precisions for human plasma samples were better than 10% coefficient of variation (CV) except for very low abundant FAs and LODs were in the low femtomol range on column. The developed GC-MS method also allows quantification of conjugated FAs such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers because lowering the derivatization temperature from 95 degrees C to room temperature prevented cis to trans double bond isomerization. Finally, profiling of fatty acid synthesis and metabolism was exemplified with stable isotope labeling of macrophages using fatty acid precursors or deuterated fatty acids. In summary, we present a fast and robust GC-MS method for fatty acid profiling of positional and geometrical isomers including CLAs as well as very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs).

The distribution of contaminated wells was complex, with very different PFOA concentrations in closely-spaced wells (<100 m apart). PFOA was introduced into the environment by a factory that produced Teflon (TM)-coated fabrics from about 1978-2002. Manufacturing involved PFOA expulsion from smokestacks followed by atmospheric transport, deposition, and downward leaching to the aquifer system. The fractured rock aquifer was characterized through physical components (geologic mapping, spatial analysis of wells, and geophysical logging) to build a Three-dimensional conceptual model and then map the spatial distribution of chemical groundwater tracers (PFOA, major and trace elements, stable isotopes, and and recharge ages), adding a fourth temporal dimension. The field area consists of four imbricated metamorphic rock slices bounded by thrust faults. The dominant fracture sets that overprint these slices control the N-S and E-W topographic ""grain."" Geophysical logging divided wells into those completed internal to or on the margins of thrust slices. Major and trace element analysis shows that groundwater can be spatially discriminated into carbonate (TDS, Ca, Mg, HCO3), shaly (Sr, U, SO4), and siliceous (K, Si) groups. Depleted H2O stable isotope signatures characterize the siliceous group. Recharge-ages determined from CFC11, 12, and 113 and tritium correlate with geochemical groups and were divided into ""older"" (similar to 1953-73) and ""younger"" (1963-88), which predate and are synchronous with factory operation, respectively. Our conceptual model shows recharge from highlands to the west and east flowing toward the Bennington valley where it is locally tapped by wells along thrust faults or fracture zones. This water has older recharge ages and anomalously low PFOA concentrations (<6.7 ppt in 12 of 15 samples, mean = 7.9 ppt) compared to the majority of wells in this region, which are completed in the internal portions of thrust slices. These wells contain groundwater with younger recharge ages and high PFOA concentrations (mean = 290 ppt) and occurrence (>20 ppt in 28/36 samples), indicating mixing of younger and older waters.",NA,10.3389/frwa.2023.1117780,character(0),NA,NA

Body feathers from the White-tailed eagles were also analysed and significant associations between specific PFASs in blood plasma and body feathers were found (0.36 < R-2 < 0.67; all p < 0.05). This result suggests that analysing body feathers of White-tailed eagle could potentially be a useful non-invasive strategy to monitor PFASs exposure in nestlings of this species. White-tailed eagles showed significantly higher levels of contaminants than Northern goshawks (plasma EPFASs Median = 45.83 vs 17.02 ng(-1), p < 0.05). The different exposure between both species seemed to be related to different dietary input, as quantified by stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of body feathers. A priori, the bird of prey populations studied are not at risk for PFASs, since the levels in plasma of both species were hundreds to thousand times lower than the toxic reference values reported for predatory birds.

The main purpose of this study was to assess the relative longrange transport (LRT) potential of each conjugate pair, collectively termed PFC(A)s, considering emissions from direct sources (i.e., manufacturing and use) only. Overall LRT potential (atmospheric + oceanic) varied as a function of chain length and depended on assumptions regarding pKa and mode of entry. Atmospheric transport makes a relatively higher contribution to overall LRT potential for PFC(A)s with longer chain length, which reflects the increasing trend in the air-water partition coefficient (KAW) of the neutral PFCA species with chain length. Model scenarios using estimated direct emissions of the C8, C9, and C11 PFC(A)s indicate that the mass fluxes to the Arctic marine environment associated with oceanic transport are in excess of mass fluxes from indirect sources (i.e., atmospheric transport of precursor substances such as fluorotelomer alcohols and subsequent degradation to PFCAs). Modeled concentrations of C8 and C9 in the abiotic environment are broadly consistent with available monitoring data in surface ocean waters. Furthermore, the modeled concentration ratios of C8 to C9 are reconcilable with the homologue pattern frequently observed in biota, assuming a positive correlation between bioaccumulation potential and chain length. Modeled concentration ratios of C11 to C10 are more difficult to reconcile with monitoring data in both source and remote regions. Our model results for C11 and C10 therefore imply that either (i) indirect sources are dominant or (ii) estimates of direct emission are not accurate for these homologues. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/es900753y,Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;Environmental Monitoring;Carboxylic Acids;Arctic;Arctic marine;fluorocarbon;carbon;Carbon;comparative study;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;Environmental Pollutants;marine environment;long range transport;Long range transport;environmental fate;sea water;article;carboxylic acid;Atmospheric movements;atmospheric transport;Perfluorocarboxylic acid;Positive correlations;Fluorotelomer alcohols;Seawater;Geography;sea;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;environmental impact;degradation;concentration (parameters);pollutant source;Plasmas;Atmospheric transport;Air Pollutants;Water;atmospheric pollution;Air;Oceanography;pollutant transport;mass;ester;air;Chain length;Acids;Concentration ratio;Water Pollutants;carbon 11;AC generator motors;Arctic Ocean;Biological Transport;Chemical;air-water interaction;atmosphere;Computer Simulation;Fate;Perfluorocarboxylates;transport;mass balance;Multi-species;mass transport;Mass flux;Bioaccumulation potential;transport kinetics;atmospheric modeling;Direct emissions;Mass balance model;Air-water;Comparative assessment;Conjugate basis;Conjugate pair;Heat flux;Model results;Remote regions;Solar concentrators;Surface ocean,NA,NA

To complete this assessment small mammals, vegetation, soil, and insect samples were collected from areas within and adjacent to the Beatty, Nevada, LLRW site and from a reference area located approximately 3 km south of the LLRW site. Samples underwent analysis via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, or scintillation spectroscopy depending on the analyte of interest. Small mammal tissues showed maximum concentrations of over 1700 ng/g for PFAS, 1600 ng/g for PCBs, and 10 000 Bq/kg for tritium. The primary contaminants found in soil samples were PCBs, with maximum concentrations exceeding 25 ng/g. Trace amounts of PFAS were also detected in soils and insects. Only qualitative data were obtained from vegetation samples because of the complex matrix of the dominant plant species (creosote bush; Larrea tridentata [Sessé & Moc. ex DC.] Coville). Overall, these data indicate the presence of various anthropogenic contaminants in the ecosystem surrounding the LLRW area, but additional analyses are necessary to confirm the sources and migration pathways of PFAS and PCBs in this hyperarid environment.

As a limited number of PFAS is routinely analyzed in human serum, complementary analytical methods are required to characterize the overlooked fraction. A promising tool is the total oxidizable precursors (TOP) assay to look for precursors by oxidation to perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA). The TOP assay was originally developed for large volumes of water and had to be adapted for 250 μL of human serum. Optimization of the method was performed on serum samples spiked with model precursors. Oxidative conditions similar to previous TOP assay methods were not sufficient for complete oxidation of model precursors. Prolonged heating time (24 h) and higher oxidant amount (95 mg of Na2S2O8 per 225 μL of serum) were needed for complete conversion of the model precursors and accomplishing PFAA yields of 35–100 %. As some precursors are not fully converted to PFAA, the TOP assay can only provide semi-quantitative estimates of oxidizable precursors in human serum. However, the TOP assay can be used to give indications about the identity of unknown precursors by evaluating the oxidation products, including perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSA) and perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECA).

It is now clear, however, that plastics are also responsible for significant harms to human health, the economy, and the earth's environment. These harms occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, from extraction of the coal, oil, and gas that are its main feedstocks through to ultimate disposal into the environment. The extent of these harms not been systematically assessed, their magnitude not fully quantified, and their economic costs not comprehensively counted. Goals: The goals of this Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health are to comprehensively examine plastics' impacts across their life cycle on: (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations-the poor, minorities, and the world's children. On the basis of this examination, the Commission offers science-based recommendations designed to support development of a Global Plastics Treaty, protect human health, and save lives. Report structure: This Commission report contains seven Sections. Following an Introduction, Section 2 presents a narrative review of the processes involved in plastic production, use, and disposal and notes the hazards to human health and the environment associated with each of these stages. Section 3 describes plastics' impacts on the ocean and notes the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure. Section 4 details plastics' impacts on human health. Section 5 presents a first-order estimate of plastics' health-related economic costs. Section 6 examines the intersection between plastic, social inequity, and environmental injustice. Section 7 presents the Commission's findings and recommendations. Plastics: Plastics are complex, highly heterogeneous, synthetic chemical materials. Over 98% of plastics are produced from fossil carbon- coal, oil and gas. Plastics are comprised of a carbon-based polymer backbone and thousands of additional chemicals that are incorporated into polymers to convey specific properties such as color, flexibility, stability, water repellence, flame retardation, and ultraviolet resistance. Many of these added chemicals are highly toxic. They include carcinogens, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate flame retardants. They are integral components of plastic and are responsible for many of plastics' harms to human health and the environment.Global plastic production has increased almost exponentially since World War II, and in this time more than 8,300 megatons (Mt) of plastic have been manufactured. Annual production volume has grown from under 2 Mt in 1950 to 460 Mt in 2019, a 230-fold increase, and is on track to triple by 2060. More than half of all plastic ever made has been produced since 2002. Single-use plastics account for 35-40% of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufacture. Explosive recent growth in plastics production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossil-carbon corporations that produce coal, oil and gas and that also manufacture plastics. These corporations are reducing their production of fossil fuels and increasing plastics manufacture. The two principal factors responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbon-based fuels due to increases in 'green' energy, and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to fracking. Plastic manufacture is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to climate change. At present, plastic production is responsible for an estimated 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the contribution of Brazil. This fraction is projected to increase to 4.5% by 2060 if current trends continue unchecked. Plastic life cycle: The plastic life cycle has three phases: production, use, and disposal. In production, carbon feedstocks-coal, gas, and oil-are transformed through energy-intensive, catalytic processes into a vast array of products. Plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and results in widespread human exposure to the chemicals contained in plastic. Single-use plastics constitute the largest portion of current use, followed by synthetic fibers and construction. Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950. Strategies for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling, open burning, thermal conversion, and export. Vast quantities of plastic waste are exported each year from high-income to low-income countries, where it accumulates in landfills, pollutes air and water, degrades vital ecosystems, befouls beaches and estuaries, and harms human health-environmental injustice on a global scale. Plastic-laden e-waste is particularly problematic. Environmental findings: Plastics and plastic-associated chemicals are responsible for widespread pollution. They contaminate aquatic (marine and freshwater), terrestrial, and atmospheric environments globally. The ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic, and plastics are found throughout the ocean, including coastal regions, the sea surface, the deep sea, and polar sea ice. Many plastics appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decades. Macro- and micro-plastic particles have been identified in hundreds of marine species in all major taxa, including species consumed by humans. Trophic transfer of microplastic particles and the chemicals within them has been demonstrated. Although microplastic particles themselves (>10 µm) appear not to undergo biomagnification, hydrophobic plastic-associated chemicals bioaccumulate in marine animals and biomagnify in marine food webs. The amounts and fates of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particles (MNPs <10 µm) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological systems. Adverse environmental impacts of plastic pollution occur at multiple levels from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem. MNP contamination of seafood results in direct, though not well quantified, human exposure to plastics and plastic-associated chemicals. Marine plastic pollution endangers the ocean ecosystems upon which all humanity depends for food, oxygen, livelihood, and well-being. Human health findings: Coal miners, oil workers and gas field workers who extract fossil carbon feedstocks for plastic production suffer increased mortality from traumatic injury, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Plastic production workers are at increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, neurotoxic injury, and decreased fertility. Workers producing plastic textiles die of bladder cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and interstitial lung disease at increased rates. Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer. Residents of ""fenceline"" communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. During use and also in disposal, plastics release toxic chemicals including additives and residual monomers into the environment and into people. National biomonitoring surveys in the USA document population-wide exposures to these chemicals. Plastic additives disrupt endocrine function and increase risk for premature births, neurodevelopmental disorders, male reproductive birth defects, infertility, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cancers. Chemical-laden MNPs formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organisms, including humans. Emerging, albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that MNPs may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effects as well as by acting as vectors that transport toxic chemicals and bacterial pathogens into tissues and cells.Infants in the womb and young children are two populations at particularly high risk of plastic-related health effects. Because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemicals and children's unique patterns of exposure, plastic-associated exposures are linked to increased risks of prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, birth defects of the reproductive organs, neurodevelopmental impairment, impaired lung growth, and childhood cancer. Early-life exposures to plastic-associated chemicals also increase the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases later in life. Economic findings: Plastic's harms to human health result in significant economic costs. We estimate that in 2015 the health-related costs of plastic production exceeded 250 billion (2015 Int) globally, and that in the USA alone the health costs of disease and disability caused by the plastic-associated chemicals PBDE, BPA and DEHP exceeded 920 billion (2015 Int). Plastic production results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 1.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2e) annually. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) social cost of carbon metric, we estimate the annual costs of these GHG emissions to be 341 billion (2015 Int).These costs, large as they are, almost certainly underestimate the full economic losses resulting from plastics' negative impacts on human health and the global environment. All of plastics' economic costs-and also its social costs-are externalized by the petrochemical and plastic manufacturing industry and are borne by citizens, taxpayers, and governments in countries around the world without compensation. Social justice findings: The adverse effects of plastics and plastic pollution on human health, the economy and the environment are not evenly distributed. They disproportionately affect poor, disempowered, and marginalized populations such as workers, racial and ethnic minorities, ""fenceline"" communities, Indigenous groups, women, and children, all of whom had little to do with creating the current plastics crisis and lack the political influence or the resources to address it. Plastics' harmful impacts across its life cycle are most keenly felt in the Global South, in small island states, and in disenfranchised areas in the Global North. Social and environmental justice (SEJ) principles require reversal of these inequitable burdens to ensure that no group bears a disproportionate share of plastics' negative impacts and that those who benefit economically from plastic bear their fair share of its currently externalized costs. Conclusions: It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices.The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in global plastic production. Plastics' harms are further magnified by low rates of recovery and recycling and by the long persistence of plastic waste in the environment. © 2023 The Author(s).",NA,10.5334/aogh.4056,Female;Humans;Animals;Article;United States;Child;Cardiovascular Diseases;animal;climate change;ecosystem;Ecosystem;environmental exposure;female;male;Male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;carbon;food contamination;oil;polychlorinated biphenyl;bioaccumulation;bromination;persistent organic pollutant;Persistent Organic Pollutants;chemistry;food;hydrophobicity;organophosphate;perfluoroalkanoic acid;environmental management;flame retardant;Flame Retardants;marine environment;plasticizer;water pollution;Brazil;cardiotoxicity;human;recycling;agriculture;child;preschool child;occupational exposure;reproductive toxicity;organofluorine derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;food web;waste disposal;air pollution;environmental health;Environmental health;neurotoxicity;endocrine disruptor;Endocrine Disruptors;phenol derivative;health hazard;bisphenol F;bisphenol S;trend study;plastic;plastic pollution;Plastics;estuary;biotransformation;aquatic environment;landfill;risk reduction;Microplastics;sea;particle size;polymerization;cardiovascular disease;environmental protection;global disease burden;marine species;microplastic;microplastic pollution;oil spill;environmental impact;biodegradation;public health;sea food;incineration;solid waste management;bioremediation;combustion;polymer;carcinogen;placenta;environmental policy;fresh water;fire;zooplankton;antioxidant;melamine;phthalic acid derivative;molecular stability;ultraviolet radiation;energy transfer;monomer;manufacturing;government;sea ice;oxygen;purification;life cycle;nanoplastic;inhalation;4;4' isopropylidenediphenol;Human health;Preschool;deep sea;plastic waste;metabolic disorder;ingestion;particulate matter;vulnerable population;nephrotoxicity;lung toxicity;e-waste;social justice;citric acid tributyl ester;ozone;stabilizing agent;volatile organic compound;worker;Lung Neoplasms;railway;hydrolysis;photochemistry;transport;phytoplankton;health risk assessment;gastrointestinal toxicity;textile industry;coal;access to information;acetyl tributyl citrate;adipic acid derivative;benzophenone derivative;biofuel production;bisphenol derivative;building;building industry;Chronic Obstructive;chronic obstructive lung disease;Coal;coal worker;color;construction work;coral reef;depolymerization;di( 2 ethylhexyl)adipate;economic aspect;electronics industry;embedding;environmental justice;environmental resilience;explosion;flame;fossil fuel;gas;gas field;gasification;global health;greenhouse gas;greenhouse gas emission;Greenhouse Gases;health care cost;heat;hydrolytic degradation;injury;lifespan;light;lung tumor;market;Monaco;municipal waste;natural gas;occupational hazard;occupational health;Ocean health;pipeline;Plastic additives;plastic industry;Plastic life cycle;primary production (biomass);private sector;Pulmonary Disease;skin toxicity;systemic disease;systems biology;toxin;traffic;wellbeing;Humanities;Humanism,NA,NA

Significant bioaccumulation factors (>1000 L/Isg d.w.) were obtained for venlafaxine and ciprofloxacin in biofilm. Our results show that PhACs may accumulate in several biological compartments. Within an environmental compartment, similar PhACs profile and concentrations were found in different sites receiving urban pollution. Among different compartments, biofilms may be the most suitable biota matrix to monitor the immediate reception of PhACs in the biota. Our results indicate that the presence of PhACs in urban rivers and their accumulation in the biota could be incorporated as symptoms of the urban stream syndrome.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154303,character(0),NA,NA

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is requiring that more research be completed before making definitive decisions concerning the regulatory issues covered in the significant new use rule (18/10-2000) under the Toxic Substance Control Act. However, there are no risk assessment requirements under seminatural conditions in microcosms. The PFOS can enter, and has been found in, the aquatic environment through different pathways, including spills associated with use of fire-fighting foams containing PFOS, leaching from washing Scotchgard™-treated clothes with the wastewater, leaching from various coatings, discharges as residual waste from fluorochemical production, or volatilization and transportation atmospherically. The biota is the sink of PFOS rather than the sediment or soil. The aim of this article is to determine a 35-d community no-observable-effect concentration (NOECcommunity) for freshwater zooplankton and the fate of PFOS during the course of study. The PFOS persisted in the water phase with only slight reductions over the study; only the decrease from 33.9 mg/L at day 1 to 29.8 mg/L at day 35 was significant. A 90 to 100% reduction (p < 0.01) of the total zooplankton population was found after one week of exposure to 30 mg PFOS/L and a similar reduction after two weeks at 10 mg PFOS/L.

And different levels of HMs led to insignificant different responses on the inhibiting effects of PFAAs uptake in earthworms. The increase of Cd in fraction C (associated with cytosol) and decrease of PFAAs in fraction C and fraction P (associated with tissue fragments, cell membranes, and intact cells) especially for fraction C were revealed when they were combined, suggesting cytosolic PFAAs and Cd were susceptibly mutual effected.

In the present work, a gradient boosted tree-based model for predicting log IE in negative mode was trained and then validated using 33 PFAS standards. The root-mean-square errors were 0.79 (for the entire test set) and 0.29 (for the 7 PFASs in the test set) log IE units.

Bird eggs have often been used as less-invasive biomonitoring tools for toxicological risk assessments of persistent organic pollutants, including some PFAAs. Hereby, it is typically assumed that one random egg is representative for the PFAA concentrations of the whole clutch. However, variation of PFAA concentrations within clutches due to laying sequence influences can have important implications for the egg collection strategy and may impede interpretations of the quantified concentrations. Therefore, the main objective of this paper was to study variation patterns and possible laying sequence associations with PFAA concentrations in eggs of the great tit (Parus major). Eight whole clutches (4–8 eggs) were collected at a location in the Antwerp region, situated about 11 km from a known PFAA point source. The ∑ PFAA concentrations ranged from 8.9 to 75.1 ng g−1 ww. PFOS concentrations ranged from 6.7 to 55.1 ng g−1 ww and this compound was the dominant contributor to the total PFAA profile (74%), followed by PFDoA (7%), PFOA (7%), PFDA (5%), PFTrA (4%) and PFNA (3%). The within-clutch variation (70.7%) of the ∑ PFAA concentrations was much larger than the among-clutch variation (29.3%) and concentrations decreased significantly for some PFAA compounds throughout the laying sequence. Nevertheless, PFAA concentrations were positively and significantly correlated between some egg pairs within the same clutch, especially between egg 1 and egg 3. For future PFAA biomonitoring studies, we recommend to consistently collect the same egg along the laying sequence, preferably the first or third egg if maximizing egg exposure metrics is the main objective. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd; Due to large within-clutch variation in PFAA concentrations, we recommend to consistently use the same egg, preferably the first or third, when maximizing egg exposure metrics is the main objective. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2018.12.014,Eggs;Fluorocarbons;PFAAs;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;animal;concentration (parameter);female;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;biomonitoring;controlled study;Organic pollutants;environmental monitoring;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;perfluoro compound;quality control;concentration (composition);egg;pollution exposure;wildlife;high performance liquid chromatography;procedures;tandem mass spectrometry;risk assessment;Risk assessment;Perfluorinated compounds;ultra performance liquid chromatography;passerine;ecotoxicology;egg laying;chemical analysis;metabolism;limit of quantitation;clutch size;Clutch variation;Great tit;organofluorine;Parus major;Passeriformes;Clutches;Laying order;analysis;Aves;Passeri;songbird;Songbirds;Terrestrial passerine;Ovum,NA,NA

Results suggest that dumping sites are a source of DRCs and PFOS. Hepatic concentrations of DRCs in piglets were higher than in mothers, especially for the congeners with molecular weights in the range of 360 to 400, implying congener-specific maternal transfer of DRCs in swine. Concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and some non-ortho dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the liver of pigs were higher than those in the adipose fat and muscle of the same specimens. In addition, the liver-to-adipose concentration ratios for each congener had a significant positive correlation with the levels of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A-like protein, suggesting congener-specific and CYP1A-dependent hepatic sequestration of DRCs in the swine.

Total 17 PFAS levels in liver samples (4.5; 2.7–6.6 ng/g wet weight) were significantly higher than in muscle samples (1.0; 0.51–2.6 ng/g wet weight). More than 90% PFAS burdens in our fish samples were attributed to muscle and blood rather than liver, but contributions of individual compounds varied greatly. The most predominant substances were perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and PFA with chain lengths from C10 to C14 (i.e., PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, PFTrDA, and PFTeDA). There is no significant difference in PFAS concentrations between the studied species (i.e., bighead carp, common carp, rohu, and tilapia), but common carp showed specific PFAS profiles as compared to other species (e.g., higher proportions of PFOS and long-chain PFA such as PFTrDA, PFTeDA, and PFHxDA). Daily intake doses of PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) through fish consumption were markedly lower than the US EPA reference dose of 20 ng/kg/day. Weekly intakes of the sum of PFHxS, PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA in our study were still lower than the EFSA tolerable weekly intake of 4.4 ng/kg/week. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA,10.1007/s11356-022-19532-0,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Animals;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Tissue Distribution;United States;Risk Assessment;Vietnam;animal;fluorocarbon;fish;alkanesulfonic acid;risk assessment;muscle;tissue distribution;lake;Lakes;PFOA;Fishes;Viet Nam;Freshwater fish;Hanoi;Urban lakes;West Lake [Hangzhou],NA,NA

The opinions are divergent whether the exposure to general populations occurs mainly indirect through precursor compounds or direct via PFCAs. Previous results showed elevated blood levels of PFCAs in ski wax technicians compared to a general population. The objective of this follow-up study was to determine concentrations of PFCAs, perfluorosulfonates (PFSAs), and fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), precursor compounds that are known to degrade to PFCAs, in air collected in the breathing zone of ski wax technicians during work. We collected air samples by using ISOLUTE ENV+ cartridges connected to portable air pumps with an air flow of 2.0 L min -1. PFCAs C5-C11 and PFSAs C4, C6, C8, and C10 were analyzed using LC-MS/MS and FTOHs 6:2, 8:2, and 10:2 with GC-MS/MS. The results show daily inhalation exposure of 8:2 FTOH in μg/m3 air which is up to 800 times higher than levels of PFOA with individual levels ranging between 830-255000 ng/m3 air.

The present study revealed that zebrafish embryos exposed to 16. μM PFOS during a sensitive window of 48-96. hour post-fertilization (hpf) disrupted larval morphology at 120. hpf. Malformed zebrafish larvae were characterized by uninflated swim bladder, less developed gut, and curved spine. Histological and ultrastructural examination of PFOS-exposed larvae showed structural alterations in swim bladder and gut. Whole genome microarray was used to identify the early transcripts dysregulated following exposure to 16. μM PFOS at 96. hpf. In total, 1278 transcripts were significantly misexpressed (p<. 0.05) and 211 genes were changed at least two-fold upon PFOS exposure in comparison to the vehicle-exposed control group. A PFOS-induced network of perturbed transcripts relating to swim bladder and gut development revealed that misexpression of genes were involved in organogenesis. Taken together, early life stage exposure to PFOS perturbs various molecular pathways potentially resulting in observed defects in swim bladder and gut development. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.03.005,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;chemical pollutant;Animals;Environmental Exposure;environmental exposure;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;pollution exposure;gene expression;toxicity;embryo;article;priority journal;zebra fish;signal transduction;genetic transcription;Zebrafish;gene targeting;developmental disorder;genetic analysis;Gene Expression Regulation;cyprinid;biological uptake;Developmental toxicity;histology;developmental stage;concentration response;Organogenesis;Embryo;Water Pollutants;Developmental;fertilization;Intestines;ultrastructure;Chemical;larva;larval stage;Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;gene function;Nonmammalian;spine malformation;Zebrafish embryo;molecular mechanics;animal structures;Air Sacs;bladder malformation;Swim bladder;bladder development;fertilization (reproduction);Gut;intestine development;intestine malformation;organogenesis,NA,NA

PFOA poses a risk to aquatic ecosystems and human health due to its presence in water, environmental persistence, and bioaccumulation. Since rodlet cells (RCs) have emerged as potential biomarkers for chemical stressors, this study aimed to investigate the effects of sub-chronic PFOA exposure on RCs in the renal hematopoietic tissue of common carp. Three groups of fish were used: an unexposed control group and two groups exposed to environmentally relevant (200 ng L−1) and elevated (2 mg L−1) PFOA concentrations. Light and transmission electron microscopy were employed to assess RCs’ distribution patterns and exocytosis, while biometry quantified RCs in the hematopoietic tissue. The results showed that, even at environmentally relevant concentrations, PFOA significantly influenced RCs’ distribution patterns, leading to increased occurrence and cluster formation, as well as heightened exocytosis activity. This research highlights PFOA’s immunotoxicity in fish and suggests the potential of RCs as sentinel cells in the immunological response to environmental contaminants.

Additionally, the co-presence of microplastics and arsenic can cause synergistic, antagonistic, or potentiating toxic impacts on plants. However, limited studies are available on the combined effects of microplastics and arsenic on plants. This paper elucidates both the individual and synergistic effects of microplastics and arsenic on plants. At the outset, the paper highlighted the presence and degradation of microplastics in soil. Subsequently, the interactions between microplastics and plants, accumulation, and influences of microplastics on plant growth and metabolism were explained with underlying mechanisms. Combined effects of microplastics and arsenic on plant growth, metabolism, and toxicity were discussed thereafter. Combined toxic effects of microplastics and arsenic on plants can have detrimental implications on environment, ecosystems and biodiversity.

Among the target 11 PFAAs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (2.15-73.9ngL-1) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) (<LOQ-22.2ngL-1) were the dominant components in surface water, followed by perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) with the maximum concentration of 10.5ngL-1. PFOS was also dominant (0.13-6.95ngg-1dw) in the sediments, accounting for 15-85% of σPFAAs concentrations in 70% of the sediment samples. Sediment-water partitioning coefficients showed that logKOC increased linearly with the increasing chain length, with the logKOC values increased by 0.1-0.4logunit with each CF2 moiety from C8 to C12 perfluorinated carboxylic acids. Three specific molecular ratios, PFOS/PFOA, PFOA/PFNA and PFHpA/PFOA were used to characterize the potential sources. It indicated that the majority of pollutants was from direct emissions from manufacturing processes. The PFOA/PFNA ratios between 1.7 and 56.8 in surface water suggested the influence of secondary sources such as the degradation of volatile precursor substances. Given the high ratios of PFHpA/PFOA (0.05-7.93), it also indicated the influence from atmospheric deposition to the epilimnion. The predicted environmental concentrations were calculated from European Union system for the evaluation of substances model (EUSES).

In the present study, we investigated whether Cl-PFAESs could induce cellular effects through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) signaling pathways like PFOS. By using fluorescence competitive binding assay, we found two dominant Cl-PFAESs (6:2 Cl-PFAES and 8:2 Cl-PFAES) bound to PPARs with affinity higher than PFOS. Based on the luciferase reporter gene transcription assay, the two Cl-PFAESs also showed agonistic activity toward PPARs signaling pathways with potency similar to (6:2 Cl-PFAES) or higher than (8:2 Cl-PFAES) PFOS. Molecular docking simulation showed the two Cl-PFAESs fitted into the ligand binding pockets of PPARs with very similar binding mode as PFOS. The cell function results showed Cl-PFAESs promoted the process of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells with potency higher than PFOS. Taken together, we found for the first time that Cl-PFAESs have the ability to interfere with PPARs signaling pathways, and current exposure level of 6:2 Cl-PFAES in occupational workers has exceeded the margin of safety.

The sampling was performed in two ways, Ponar grabs of surface sediments for current spatial distribution across the lake and dated cores for multi-decadal temporal trends. Mean concentrations of the sum of PFASs (∑PFASs) were 1.5, 4.6 and 3.1 ng g−1 dry mas (dm) in surface sediments for Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron, respectively. Of the five Laurentian Lakes, the watersheds of Superior and Huron are the less densely populated by humans, and concentrations observed were typically less and from more diffuse sources, due to lesser urbanization and industrialization. However, some regions of greater concentrations were observed and might indicate more local, point sources. In core samples concentrations ranged from <LOQ to 46.6 ng g−1 dm among the three lakes with concentrations typically increasing with time. Distributions of PFASs within dated cores largely corresponded with increase in use of PFASs, but with physiochemical characteristics also affecting distribution. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) with chain lengths >7 that include perfluoro-n-octane sulfonate (PFOS) bind more strongly to sediment, which resulted in more accurate analyses of temporal trends. Shorter-chain PFASs, such as perfluoro-n-butanoic acid which is the primary replacement for C8 PFASs that have been phased out, are more soluble and were identified in some core layers at depths corresponding to pre-production periods. Thus, analyses of temporal trends of these more soluble compounds in cores of sediments were less accurate. Total elemental fluorine (TF) and extractable organic fluorine (EOF) indicated that identified PFASs were not a significant fraction of fluorine containing compounds in sediment (<0.01% in EOF).

A comprehensive, quantitative analysis – consisting of target analysis (66 different analytes, including e. g. ultrashort-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), precursor compounds and novel substitutes) and the Total Oxidisable Precursor (TOP) assay (including trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)) – were conducted to analyse the PFAS concentrations and patterns in 12 mammalian and two bird species from different areas of Germany and Denmark. The PFAS contamination was investigated in dependance of the trophic class (herbivores, omnivores, carnivores), ecological habitat (terrestrial, (semi-) aquatic) and body tissue (liver, musculature). PFAS concentrations were highest in carnivores, followed by omnivores and herbivores, with ∑PFAS concentration ranging from 1274 μg/kg (Eurasian otter liver) to 22 μg/kg (roe deer liver). TFA dominated in the herbivorous species, whereas perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and the long-chain PFCAs covered the majority of the PFAS contamination in carnivorous species. Besides trophic class, ecological habitat also affected the PFAS levels in the different species, with terrestrial herbivores and omnivores showing higher PFAS concentration than their aquatic counterparts, whereas for carnivores this relationship was reversed. The TOP assay analysis indicated similar trends, with the PFCA formation pattern differing significantly between the trophic classes. TFA was formed predominantly in herbivorous and omnivorous species, whereas in carnivorous species a broad spectrum of PFCAs (chain-length C2–C14) was formed. Musculature tissue of six species exhibited significantly lower PFAS concentrations than the respective liver tissue, but with similar PFAS patterns. The comprehensive approach applied in the present study showed, that primarily the trophic class is decisive for the PFAS concentration, as herbivores, omnivores and carnivores clearly differed in their PFAS concentrations and patterns. Additionally, the TOP assay gave novel insights in the PFCA formation potential in biota samples. © 2023",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162361,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Birds;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;animal;Ecosystems;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;bird;bioaccumulation;contamination;environmental monitoring;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;LC-MS-MS;Lc.ms/ms;Mammals;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;liquid chromatography;Polyfluorinated alkyl substances;quantitative analysis;Tissue;biota;mass spectrometry;carboxylic acid;carboxylic acid derivative;Germany;organofluorine derivative;Terrestrial animals;perfluorinated alkyl substance;species comparison;Perfluorinated carboxylic acids;Tissue engineering;species difference;organofluorine;perfluorinated carboxylic acid;liver level;total oxidizable precursor assay;habitat;mammal;trifluoroacetic acid;Water Pollutants;herbivory;Deer;muscle level;assay;Chemical;Denmark;polyfluorinated alkyl substance;herbivore;Aquatic;Aquatic animals;Biota screening;Body tissues;carnivore;deer;Herbivory;LC MS/MS;omnivore;omnivory;Precursor potential;terrestrial animals;Ultrashort-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid;Ultrashort-chain PFCA;Learning,NA,NA

Many HBCD facilities are located at the coast and the released HBCD may enter into the coastal ecosystem. There is a risk that HBCD can transfer through the food web to the diet of local population. Therefore, the coastal organisms near one of the biggest HBCD facilities in China were investigated. Variation was observed for the bioaccumulation of HBCD between the detrital food chain and the grazing food chain. In the studied species, the mullet was most contaminated which may be caused by its feeding on detritus. At the same time, the transfer of HBCD along the food web was investigated, and HBCD was biomagnified from the prey to the predator in the grazing food chains. Among the three diastereoisomers, alpha-HBCD was biomagnified with increasing trophic levels in the food web while beta- and gamma-HBCD were not. To assess the human dietary exposure, the dietary intake of HBCD from seafood was estimated, and the estimated daily intake (EDI) was 5.22 ng/kg/day for adults, and 16.39 ng/kg/day for children. The EDI for local residents were tens of times higher than that for general population in China, but the risk through dietary intake was very low in terms of existing reference dose.

Studies have shown that the toxicity of PFAAs is determined by the carbon chain length as well as the attached functional group. The locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae has become widely used for evaluation of chemicals with neurotoxic properties. In the present study the behavioral effects of seven structurally different PFAAs (i.e. TFAA, PFBA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFBS and PFOS) were evaluated in zebrafish larvae. Exposure to high concentrations of TFAA, PFNA, PFBS and PFOS resulted in distinct changes in behavioral patterns. Based on redundancy analysis, our results demonstrate three main factors affecting zebrafish larval locomotor behavior. The strongest effect on behavior was determined by the carbon chain length and the attached functional group. PFAAs with longer carbon chain length as well as PFAAs with attached sulfonic groups showed larger potential to affect locomotor behavior in zebrafish larvae. Also the concentration of the PFAAs determined the behavior responses. The results of the present study are in agreement with previous studies showing correlations between the chemical structure of PFAAs and the toxicological effects. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.10.021,Fluorocarbons;chemical pollutant;Animals;environmental exposure;female;male;nonhuman;perfluoroalkyl acid;unclassified drug;controlled study;bioaccumulation;fish;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;pollution exposure;sulfonic acid derivative;article;organofluorine derivative;priority journal;toxicology;perfluorononanoic acid;pollution effect;neurotoxicity;zebra fish;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;organic acid;organic pollutant;Zebrafish;animal behavior;embryotoxicity;perfluorobutyric acid;swimming;behavioral response;butyric acid derivative;locomotion;Water Pollutants;Multivariate Analysis;Chemical;motor activity;Motor Activity;larva;Larva;Behavior;redundancy analysis;chemical stress;Larvae;Locomotor activity;Perfluoralkyl acid,NA,NA

Data on hydro-chemical parameters and stable isotopes of water were collected in urban and forest springs in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine, over a period of 12 months. Groundwater transit time and precipitation contribution were calculated using hydrogeological data and stable isotopes of water to delineate groundwater recharge conditions. Hydro-chemical data, stable isotopes and emerging contaminants were used to trace anthropogenic groundwater recharge and approximate sewage and tap water contributions to the aquifer. The results indicated that each spring had unique isotopic signatures that could be explained by recharge conditions, groundwater residence time, and specific mixing patterns with sewage and water leaks. Elevated nitrate content, stable isotopes of nitrate, and the presence of emerging pollutants (mainly illicit drugs) in most of the urban springs confirmed mixing of urban groundwater with sewage leaks. These leaks amounted to up to 25% of total recharge and exhibited seasonal variations in some springs. Overall, the results show that urban groundwater receives variable seasonal contributions of anthropogenic components that increase the risk to the environment and human health, and reduce its usability for drinking water production. The multi-tracing approach presented can be useful for other cities worldwide that have similar problems of poor water management and inadequate sewage and water supply infrastructure.

This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes. Reported sources of PFASs in Africa include municipal landfills, inefficient wastewater treatment plants, consumer products containing PFASs, industrial wastewater and urban runoff. Relevant stakeholders need to take serious action to identify and deal with the salient sources of PFASs on the African continent.

Contamination levels were determined in the muscle of adult individuals of both sexes in relation to biological and trophic parameters. Maternal transfer was additionally investigated in one set of embryos in each species. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organochlorinated pesticide (OCP) and perfluoroalkylated substance (PFAS) concentrations were 2597 ± 2969, 785 ± 966 and 267 ± 194 pg g-1 ww, respectively, in bull sharks, and 339 ± 270, 1025 ± 946 and 144 ± 53 pg g-1 ww in tiger sharks. The results highlighted higher PCB contamination, and by the heavier congeners, in adult bull sharks versus tiger sharks. The significant differences found in PCB profiles and concentrations suggest that the two species are exposed to different contamination sources. As bull sharks rely on a more coastal habitat for feeding, their higher contamination by PCBs suggests the occurrence of local PCB sources. DDT concentrations were similar in both species, suggesting a more homogeneous contamination on the scale of the Southwest Indian Ocean. Female bull sharks showed lower OCP and PCB concentrations than males, while this trend was not observed in tiger sharks. The ratio of chlorinated contaminants in muscle between the mother and her embryos was related to molecule hydrophobicity in bull shark but not in tiger shark, suggesting that shark mode of gestation, known to be different in the two species, is a key driver of organic contaminant maternal transfer. Finally, the results show that organic contaminant levels in the studied species were lower than those of other shark species in the Southern Hemisphere, related to the limited urbanization and industrialization of Reunion Island. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141807,Female;Humans;Persistent organic pollutants;Animals;Article;animal;female;male;Male;nonhuman;trophic level;unclassified drug;Organic pollutants;polychlorinated biphenyl;bioaccumulation;persistent organic pollutant;animal tissue;hydrophobicity;perfluoro compound;Muscle;Contamination levels;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;source apportionment;surfactant;PCB;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;embryo;human;Contamination;priority journal;placental transfer;chlorphenotane;Emerging organic contaminants;organochlorine pesticide;Southern Hemisphere;species habitat;Indian Ocean;coastal waters;shark;sea food;Seafood;Organochlorinated pesticides;species distribution;Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB);Persistent organic pollutants (POPs);perfluoroalkylated substance;Perfluoroalkylated substances;viviparity;Chondrichthyes;Sharks;Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs);Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs);Bull shark;Carcharhinus leucas;Contamination sources;Galeocerdo;Galeocerdo cuvier;Mascarene Islands;Perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs);Reunion;Tiger shark,NA,NA

However, there is a paucity of information on the link between PFASs and oxidative stress, which can have potential detrimental effects on key fitness traits, such as cellular homeostasis or reproduction. We have examined the correlations between multiple blood-based markers of oxidative status and several perfluoroalkyl acids (i.e., with 8 or more carbons) in male Arctic black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) during the pre-laying period. Higher protein oxidative damage was found in those birds having higher concentrations of perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTriA) and perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeA). Lower plasmatic non-enzymatic micro-molecular antioxidants were found in those birds having higher concentrations of perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), PFDoA and PFTeA. Effect size estimates showed that the significant correlations between PFASs and oxidative status markers were intermediate to strong. The non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity (including antioxidants of protein origin) was significantly lower in those birds having higher plasma concentration of linear perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOSlin). In contrast, the activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase in erythrocytes was not associated with any PFAS compounds.

Owing to their persistence in the environment and their bioaccumulative potential, several PFCs have been detected worldwide in environmental samples. Biomonitoring studies have shown extensive human exposure to these compounds. The routes of human exposure to perfluorinated compounds have not been well characterized, but food, food packaging, household dust, and drinking water are all likely to contribute. Among PFCs, research focuses mainly on perfluoroocanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA,) which have been produced in highest amounts for several decades and have been recognized by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as emerging contaminants in the food chain. EFSA has established tolerable daily intakes (TDI) of 150 ng kg-1 b.w. day-1 for PFOS and 1500 ng kg-1 b.w. day-1 for PFOA. PFOS, its salts and PFOS-F (perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride) have been added to the list of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, in an amendment of May 2009. According to EFSA, collection of data for concentration levels in the food chain is of critical importance. PFCs are used extensively in foodstuff packages as coatings/additives for oil and moisture resistance. Since food packaging materials come directly in contact with food, PFCs can possibly pass through the material and accumulate in food. The main objective of this study was to perform a first survey of the level of contamination to different alkyl chain length perfluorinated compounds in Greece. The study included the analyses of food samples from the Greek market (meat products, fish, vegetables and milk), foodstuff packaging materials and blood samples from three different groups of adults living in Greece: a group of individuals living in Athens, a group of inhabitants of the semi-urban and rural area of Argolida, and a group of cancer patients from the St. Savvas Anticancer Hospital in Athens.

A recent study reported the detection of inorganic fluorinated anions in German river systems, and therefore, in some samples, EOF may include some inorganic fluorinated anions. Thus, it might be more appropriate to use the term “extractable fluorine (EF) analysis” instead of the term EOF analysis. In this study, tap water samples (n = 39) from Shanghai were collected to assess the levels of EF/EOF, 35 target PFAS, two inorganic fluorinated anions (tetrafluoroborate (BF4-) and hexafluorophosphate (PF6-)), and novel PFAS through suspect screening and potential oxidizable precursors through oxidative conversion. The results showed that ultra-short PFAS were the largest contributors to target PFAS, accounting for up to 97% of ΣPFAS. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time that bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NTf2) was reported in drinking water from China, and p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS) was also identified through suspect screening. Small amounts of precursors that can be oxidatively converted to PFCAs were noted after oxidative conversion. EF mass balance analysis revealed that target PFAS could only explain less than 36% of EF. However, the amounts of unexplained extractable fluorine were greatly reduced when BF4- and PF6- were included. These compounds further explained more than 44% of the EF, indicating the role of inorganic fluorinated anions in the mass balance analysis. © 2023 The Authors.

Because they are not chemically bound to these products and are widely used, the potential for environmental contamination is significant. Phthalates and their metabolites have been associated with endocrine disruption and reproductive impairment, among other adverse health effects, in laboratory animals and human epidemiologic studies. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are vulnerable to environmental pollutants due to their apex position in the food chain, long life spans, and habitat overlap with developed coastal areas. The objective of this study was to quantify phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine collected from bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, during May 2016 (n = 7) and May 2017 (n = 10). Screening of nine phthalate monoester metabolites in bottlenose dolphin urine was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using methods adapted from those used for analyzing human samples. At least one phthalate metabolite was detected in 71% of the dolphins sampled across both years, with the highest concentrations detected for monoethyl phthalate (MEP; GM = 5.4 ng/ml; 95%CI: 1.3-22.0 ng/ml) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP; GM = 1.9 ng/ml; 95%CI: 1.1-3.2 ng/ml). These data demonstrate exposure to two of the most commonly used phthalates in commercial manufacturing, diethyl phthalate (DEP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). This study establishes methods for urinary detection of phthalate metabolites in marine mammals and provides baseline data to address a significant and growing, yet poorly understood, health threat to marine wildlife.",NA,10.1029/2018GH000146,character(0),NA,NA

Because of daily-used chemicals (e.g., pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs)) used by residents in the area, generated sewage is considered as a point source in the Kongsfjorden. The aim of the present study was to identify and quantify organic pollutants in the effluent and along the shoreline and offshore via target, suspect, and non-target screening using liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. We tentatively identified 30 compounds using the suspect and non-target screening methods in effluent samples from our first visit to the settlement in 2016. Among these, 3 were false positive, 24 were confirmed, and the 3 remaining compounds were not confirmed because of a lack of reference standards. Of the confirmed, 21 were quantifiable and considered target compounds for the 2nd year study. The quantified compounds in the effluent samples in 2017 totaled 17, including PPCPs, pesticides, perfluorinated compounds, and their metabolites. Some of the compounds, such as caffeine, paraxanthine/theophylline, acetaminophen, cetirizine, diethyl toluamide (DEET), and icaridin, were also detected in the receiving seawater. The concentration range was from 4 to 280,000 ng/L in the effluent and 2–98 ng/L in the seawater. Other 24 compounds were tentatively identified in the second-year effluent samples. Five were further confirmed using reference standards. Prioritization was performed on the 47 substances screened in Ny-Ålesund using the exposure and toxicity index. As the result, the top seven substances of concern present were perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), irbesartan, DEET, acetaminophen, caffeine, and paraxanthine/theophylline.

In Lake Hazen, fluxes of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) increased during 1963–2011. In Lake B35, fluxes of perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) increased during 1952–2009. The temporal trends for PFASs in Lake Hazen and Lake B35 sediments are consistent with the continuous annual delivery of PFASs to the Arctic of Canada. Temporal trends in sediment cores appear to follow historical market changes in PFAS manufacturing inventory. The doubling time of PFAS fluxes are faster in Lake Hazen sediments than Lake B35 sediments. In Lake Hazen, this may be attributed to the enhanced delivery of sediment and historically-archived PFASs promoted by climate-induced glacier melting in the Lake Hazen watershed post-2005. Exponentially increasing PFAS temporal trends in High and Low Arctic lakes in Canada stress the importance of developing effective global regulatory policies for PFAS manufacturing and highlights the potential for climate change-induced contaminant release from melting glaciers in the Arctic. © 2019",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.210,Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Perfluorooctane sulfonamide;Sulfur compounds;Temporal trends;Canada;Arctic;climate change;Climate change;concentration (parameter);unclassified drug;controlled study;persistent organic pollutant;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;perfluorooctane sulfonamide;sulfonic acid derivative;long range transport;Long range transport;carboxylic acid;carboxylic acid derivative;trend analysis;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids;priority journal;perfluorononanoic acid;Perfluorononanoic acids;trend study;lake;Lakes;temporal analysis;Sedimentation;Sediments;perfluoroalkyl derivative;pollution transport;Nunavut;fluorinated hydrocarbon;history;Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);watershed;sediment core;perfluorobutane sulfonic acid;perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid derivative;lake sediment;Emissions;halocarbon;Flux;glacier;melting;climate;chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid derivative;11 chloroeicosafluoro 3 oxaundecane 1 sulfonic acid;8 chloroperfluoro 1 octane sulfonic acid;8 dioxanonanoic acid;9 chlorohexadecafluoro 3 oxanonane 1 sulfonic acid;Contaminant release;dodecafluoro 3h 4;flux measurement;Fluxes;geoaccumulation;Glacier melt;Lake Hazen;Melting;Particulate emissions;perfluoro 4 ethylcyclohexane sulfonic acid;perfluoroalkane carboxylic acid derivative,NA,NA

Here, the microbial biotransformation of C6/C6 and C8/C8 PFPiA in two soils (Soil N and Y) was investigated. After 252 d and 330 d of incubation with PFPiAs in Soil N and Y respectively, the levels of PFPiAs decreased distinctly, accompanied by the increasing perfluorohexaphosphonic acid (PFHxPA) or perfluorooctanophosphonic acid (PFOPA) formation, magnifying PFPiAs were susceptible to C-P cleavage, which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. The half-lives of the PFPiAs were longer than one year, while generally shorter in Soil N than in Soil Y and that of C6/C6 was shorter than C8/C8 PFPiA (392 d and 746 d in Soil N, and 603 and 1155 d in Soil Y, respectively). Metagenomic sequencing analysis revealed that Proteobacteria as the primary host of the potential functional genes related to C[sbnd]P bond cleavage might be the crucial phyla contributing to the biotransformation of PFPiAs. Meanwhile, the more intensive interactions between the microbes in Soil N consistently contribute to its greater capacity for transforming PFPiAs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.130896,Fluorocarbons;Biotransformation;Genes;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;controlled study;chemical compound;gene expression;soil;article;Soil;Soils;metabolism;half life time;Bioconversion;biotransformation;Half-Life;microorganism;phosphinic acid derivative;soil chemistry;density functional theory;Density functional theory;chemical bonding;Chemical bonds;Bond cleavages;CP bond cleavage;DFT;Functional genes;genomics;Metagenomic analysis;metagenomics;Microbial biotransformations;Perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acid;PFPiAs;Phosphinic acid;Phosphinic Acids;Potential functional gene;Proteobacteria;soil nitrogen,NA,NA

Moreover, some of its biological traits (long life span, inshore feeding, high trophic position) make this species a suitable sentinel of coastal pollution. Here, we investigated contamination by multiple legacy and emerging organic pollutants, such as brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), in whitemouth croakers from two estuaries (Guanabara and Sepetiba Bays) located in industrialized and urbanized areas in Rio de Janeiro State, Southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we assessed how biological and ecological features could explain the observed contamination patterns. Regarding brominated flame retardants, concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) varied from 7.6 to 879.7 pg g(-1) wet weight (w.w.), with high contribution of tetra-, penta-, hexa- and deca-BDEs. The sum of chlorinated flame retardants (dechlorane-related compounds, Sigma DRC) ranged from <LOD to 41.1 pg g(-1) w.w., mostly represented by Dechlorane 603 and Dechlorane Plus (DP). Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs varied from <LOD to 1.7 pg g(-1) w.w., while the Toxic Equivalent (TEQ-PCDD/Fs) levels ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 pg g(-1) w.w. Positive correlations between delta 15N and concentrations of tri-, tetra- and penta-BDEs, as well as Sigma DRC, DP and anti-DP isomers suggested that ecological factors (namely biomagnification along the food web) influence contamination of whitemouth croakers in the estuaries studied. Moreover, the sum of PBDEs (Sigma PBDE), tri- and tetra-BDEs concentrations were negatively correlated with fish size, suggesting that depuration by fishes and/or habitat shift throughout the whitemouth croaker's life cycle might also influence concentrations. Overall, our study emphasized the need for further investigations to help understand the complex patterns of bioaccumulation and biomagnification that seem to exist in Southeastern Brazil.

Previous reports have proved that PFOA exposure can accumulate in the ovary and lead to reproductive toxicity in pregnant mice. However, the potential mechanism of PFOA exposure on fertility remains unclear. In this study, we explore how PFOA compromises fertility in the zebrafish. The data show that PFOA (100 mg/L for 15 days) exposure significantly impaired fertilization and hatching capability. Based on tissue sections, we found that PFOA exposure led to ovarian damage and a decrease in the percentage of mature oocytes. Moreover, through in vitro incubation, we determined that PFOA inhibits oocyte development. We also sequenced the transcriptome of the ovary of female zebrafish and a total of 284 overlapping DEGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis showed that 284 overlapping DEGs function mainly in complement and coagulation cascades signaling pathways. In addition, we identified genes that may be associated with immunity, such as LOC108191474 and ZGC:173837. We found that exposure to PFOA can cause an inflammatory response that can lead to ovarian damage and delayed oocyte development. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,10.3390/ijms25010136,Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Mice;Pregnancy;Oocytes;Fertility;Ovary;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;persistent organic pollutant;animal tissue;in vitro study;mouse;perfluorooctanoic acid;adult;embryo development;embryo;hatchability;zebra fish;signal transduction;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;Zebrafish;pregnancy;transcriptome;fertility;oocyte;oocyte development;fertilization;inflammation;blood clotting;germinal vesicle;oocyte maturation;ovary;fertilization capability;functional enrichment analysis;KEGG;oocyte quality;oocytes;ovary follicle cell;tissue section;zebrafish;Self-Fertilization,NA,NA

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the origin of PFAS contamination in soil and sediment, as well as the environmental impacts associated with the distribution of PFAS in these mediums. In this review, we also discuss the effects of PFAS on soil microbes, plants, the terrestrial food web, sediment microbes, and benthic microorganisms. The highest concentration of PFAS was found in soils exposed to aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), the PFAS manufacturing plants, and biosolids, compared to landfills, atmospheric deposition, and industrial discharge, which are the other three sources. Exposure to PFAS has demonstrated negative effects on the richness, diversity, and population structure of bacterial species. It has been observed to interfere with the regular functioning of soil microorganisms, microbes, and benthic organisms in sediment. Nevertheless, the current data is insufficient to grasp the complete spectrum of effects comprehensively. Moreover, the accumulation of PFAS in plants, vegetables, and earthworms is a cause for concern, as they can eventually enter the food chain through trophic transfer processes. Finally, we discuss the challenges and possible strategies that can be implemented to restrict the dispersion of PFAS in sediments and soil. © 2024 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.cscee.2024.100643,PFAS;Biota;Soil;Exposure;Sources;Distribution;Sediment;Environmental impacts,NA,NA

Environmental chemicals may adversely affect thyroid function by disturbing gene transcription. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a persistent compound, is widely distributed in the aquatic environment and wildlife. In the present study, we investigated whether PFOS could disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to various concentrations of PFOS (0, 100, 200 and 400 μg L-1) and gene expression patterns were examined 15 d post-fertilization. The expression of several genes in the HPT system, i.e., corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), thyroglobulin (TG), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), transthyretin (TTR), iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1 and Dio2) and thyroid receptor (TRα and TRβ), was quantitatively measured using real-time PCR. The gene expression levels of CRF and TSH were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, upon exposure to 200 and 400 μg L-1 PFOS. A significant increase in NIS and Dio1 gene expression was observed at 200 μg L-1 PFOS exposure, while TG gene expression was down-regulated at 200 and 400 μg L-1 PFOS exposure. TTR gene expression was down-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner. Up-regulation and down-regulation of TRα and TRβ gene expression, respectively, was observed upon exposure to PFOS. The whole body thyroxine (T4) content remained unchanged, whereas triiodothyronine (T3) levels were significantly increased, which could directly reflect disrupted thyroid hormone status after PFOS exposure. The overall results indicated that PFOS exposure could alter gene expression in the HPT axis and that mechanisms of disruption of thyroid status by PFOS could occur at several steps in the synthesis, regulation, and action of thyroid hormones. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Several modeling studies have been conducted in attempt to resolve the dominant transport pathway of PFCs to the arctic-atmospheric transport of precursors versus direct transport via ocean currents. These studies are generally limited by their focus on perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) fluxes to arctic seawater and thus far have only used fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and sulfonamide alcohols as inputs for volatile precursors. There have been many monitoring studies from the North American and European Arctic, however, almost nothing is known about PFC levels from the Russian Arctic. In general, there are very few measurements of PFCs from the abiotic environment. Atmospheric measurements show the widespread occurrence of PFC precursors, FTOHs and perfluorinated sulfonamide alcohols. Further, PFCAs and PFSAs have been detected on atmospheric particles. The detection of PFCAs and PFSAs in snow deposition is consistent with the volatile precursor transport hypothesis. There are very limited measurements of PFCs in seawater. PFOA is generally detected in the greatest concentrations. Additional seawater measurements are needed to validate existing model predications. The bulk of the monitoring efforts in biological samples have focused on the perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) and sulfonates (PFSAs), although there are very few measurements of PFC precursors. The marine food web has been well studied, particularly the top predators. In contrast, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems have been poorly studied. Studies show that in wildlife perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is generally measured in the highest concentration, followed by either perfluorononanoate (PFNA) or perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnA). However, some whale species show relatively high levels of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) and seabirds are typically characterized by high proportions of the C-11-C-15 PFCAs. PFOA is generally infrequently detected and is present in low concentrations in arctic biota. Food web studies show high bioaccumulation in the upper trophic-level animals, although the mechanism of PFC biomagnification is not understood. Spatial trend studies show some differences between populations, although there are inconsistencies between PFC trends. The majority of temporal trend studies are from the Northern American Arctic and Greenland. Studies show generally increasing levels of PFCs from the 1970s, although some studies from the Canadian Arctic show recent declines in PFOS levels. In contrast, ringed seals and polar bears from Greenland continue to show increasing PFOS concentrations. The inconsistent temporal trends between regions may be representative of differences in emissions from source regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Sediment, surface water and biota samples were analysed for PFASs using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and stable isotope analysis of δ 13C and δ15N was performed on sediments and biota samples. Sediment samples (n=3) were suggested to have PFASs originating from different sources. Generally low concentrations were detected in sediment (sum of all detected PFASs were 2.7 ng/g in St. Aspön, 2.9 ng/g in Visingsö and 0.6 ng/g in Omberg, reported in dry weight), compared to biota and several water samples. The PFAS distribution and concentrations in the samples representing St. Aspön and Visingsö deviated from the third sample from Omberg, which was further evidenced by stable isotope analysis. The average concentration of all detected PFASs in the potentially low contaminated samples was 6 ng/L, while it was 5900 ng/L in the potentially aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) contaminated samples. Surface water samples from Jönköping airport and Kärnebäcken measured concentrations of linear perfluorooctane sulfonate (L-PFOS) that all exceeded the Annual Average Environmental Quality Standard (AA-EQS) value of 0.65 ng/L of PFOS in freshwater (fire pond: 14 000 ng/L, ditch: 600 ng/L, Sandserydsån: 160 ng/L, Kärnebäcken: 150 ng/L). A reference sample that was assumed to represent diffuse sources showed similar distribution of PFASs as in several estuaries around Lake Vättern. Since the surface area of Lake Vättern is large (1900 km2), atmospheric deposition is suggested as one of the major contamination sources. This should be further investigated to better assess the local environmental burden. Trophic magnification factors (TMFs) calculated for L-PFOS, perfluorononaoate (PFNA) and perfluorotridecanoate (PFTrDA) were > 1, indicating biomagnification to higher trophic levels. ...",NA,NA,Chemical Sciences;Kemi;Sweden,NA,NA

The effect of body condition on the distribution and composition of 16 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) was investigated in liver, blood, kidney, adipose tissue, and muscle of Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) from Svalbard (n = 18, age 1-3 years). PFAS concentrations were generally highest in liver, followed by blood and kidney, while lowest concentrations were found in adipose tissue and muscle. Concentrations of summed perfluorocarboxylic acids and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates were five and seven times higher, respectively, in adipose tissue of lean compared to fat foxes. In addition, perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) concentrations in liver, kidney, and blood, and, perfluorononanoate (PFNA) in liver and blood, were twice as high in the lean compared to the fat foxes. The ratio between perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and its metabolite perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was lowest in liver, muscle, and kidney, while significantly higher proportions of FOSA were found in adipose tissue and blood.

Degradation of lubricating films on hard disk media was investigated by TOF-SIMS and removal of the lubricant oil and chemical wear of slider materials was observed. It was found that the tribochemical degradation of the oil was catalyzed by the slider material such as Al2O3 and TiN. The degradation was suppressed when DLC and c-BN were used as a slider material.

Here, we report the presence of PFASs in Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) in England and Wales and their association with anthropogenic sources. The following 15 compounds were analyzed: 10 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), 4 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and perfluorooctane sulfonamide, in livers of 50 otters which died between 2007 and 2009. PFASs were detected in all otters analyzed, with 12/15 compounds detected in ≥80% of otters. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) accounted for 75% of the ΣPFAS profile, with a maximum concentration of 6800 μg/kg wet weight (ww). Long-chain (≥C8) PFCAs accounted for 99.9% of the ΣPFCA profile, with perfluorodecanoic acid and perfluorononanoic acid having the highest maxima (369 μg/kg ww and 170 μg/kg ww, respectively).

The interest in these contaminants arises from their inadequate regulation or lack of routine monitoring in natural environments. Among them, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of particular concern due to their notable propensity to accumulate within the kidney, significantly influencing the excretion of these pollutants. Rodlet cells (RCs) have emerged as promising indicators of immunotoxicity in response to chemical stressors. A prior comprehensive study extensively detailed the effects of sub-chronic exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a well-known PFAS compound, on RCs located in the hematopoietic tissue of the common carp kidney. Even at concentrations commonly found in the environment, PFOA exhibited a significant impact on the distribution patterns of RCs, concurrently enhancing exocytosis activity. Methods: The assessment of PFOA-induced RC degranulation employed texture analysis combined with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to differentiate between various experimental exposure groups. The investigation encompassed three fish groups: an unexposed group, a group exposed to an environmentally relevant PFOA concentration (200 ng L−1), and a group exposed to a higher PFOA concentration (2 mg L−1). Texture analysis was conducted on high-resolution color (RGB) images obtained from light microscopy of ultrathin sections from five fish per experimental group, stained with toluidine blue. Results: This analysis facilitated the quantification of potential cytoplasmic alterations associated with degranulation, encompassing all three RGB channels. The data subjected to LDA enabled the identification of the most distinctive texture characteristics, providing a reliable, objective, and reproducible method to differentiate between experimental groups. Remarkably, 98.0% of both the original and cross-validated cases were correctly classified. However, only one unexposed case was misclassified as a fish exposed to a 200 ng L−1 PFOA concentration, constituting the single false positive in the analysis. Conclusions: Utilizing texture analysis and LDA to quantify RC degranulation offers a dependable approach for assessing immunotoxicity within experimental models of toxicological and environmental pathology. This underscores the scientific significance of employing a morphological approach in such investigations.

However, less is known about low molecular weight PFASs and alternatives. This study examined the morphometric and behavioral effects in zebrafish following developmental exposures of C6 PFASs: perfluorohexanoic acid, PFHxA, perfluorohexane sulfonate, PFHxS, and 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol, 6:2 FTOH. Embryos were exposed to 0.02–20 μM concentrations of these compounds from the high stage (˜3 h post fertilization, hpf) until 120 hpf. Morphometric and gene expression endpoints were examined at 120 hpf. Genes selected for analysis were previously shown to be altered in zebrafish developmentally exposed to PFOS and PFOA. Additionally, exposed larvae were transferred to clean water and reared until 14 days post fertilization, dpf, when behavioral assays were completed and morphometric endpoints examined. While PFHxA was found to be the most acutely toxic at 120 hpf, few morphometric effects were observed. Gene expression was the most sensitive endpoint with significant increased tgfb1a, bdnf, and ap1s1 expression observed with PFHxA exposure. PFHxS exposure produced morphometric effects in the larvae, specifically increased length and yolk sac area at 2 and 20 μM. This phenotype persisted to the 14 dpf time point, where these larvae additionally displayed decreased distance traveled and crosses through the center of the arena of the behavioral assay. Exposure to 6:2 FTOH caused no morphometric effects at 120 hpf, and this compound was the least acutely toxic. However, expression of both tgfb1a and bdnf were increased by greater than 2 fold change at this time point. Effects also persisted to 14 dpf where a significant increase in distance traveled and velocity were observed in the behavioral assay. This study demonstrates effects on behavioral, morphometric and gene expression endpoints with developmental PFHxA, PFHxS, and 6:2 FTOH exposures in zebrafish. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.009,PFAS;Fluorocarbons;chemical pollutant;Animals;Article;Sulfonic Acids;Environmental Exposure;Hydrocarbons;animal;concentration (parameter);environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;animal tissue;chemistry;perfluoroalkanoic acid;water pollutant;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;gene;gene expression;genetics;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;sulfonic acid derivative;toxicity;drug effect;embryo;Caproates;priority journal;chemical analysis;toxicological parameters;metabolism;animal model;zebra fish;toxicity testing;morphometry;molecular weight;analysis;LC50;chemical structure;Zebrafish;fluorotelomer alcohol;animal behavior;genetic analysis;gene expression regulation;Gene Expression Regulation;cyprinid;Danio rerio;phenotype;hexanoic acid derivative;PFHxA;histology;fluorinated hydrocarbon;behavioral response;locomotion;PFHxS;Water Pollutants;Molecular Weight;Animal;Locomotion;Chemical;larva;Larva;Fluorinated;Behavior;behavior assessment;anatomy;6:2 FTOH;ap1s1 gene;bdnf gene;tgfb1a gene;zebrafish protein;Zebrafish Proteins;Gene Expression,NA,NA

Thus, there is an urge to assess the occurrence and the tissue distribution of PFASs in apex predators. To this end, the current study examines concentrations and distribution of 15 PFASs among 85 samples of different tissues from 9 shark and ray species collected in Greece. The results showed a similar PFAS pattern among the different tissues, with long carbon chain PFASs being the most frequently detected compounds. PFTrDA was the most predominant compound in terms of concentration and frequency of detection, followed by PFUnDA and PFOS. PFTrDA concentrations ranged between < LOQ and 27.1 ng/g ww, while PFUnDA and PFOS levels ranged from <LOQ to 16.0 and < LOQ to 21.6 ng/g ww, respectively. Regarding their frequency of detection, PFTrDA and PFUnDA were detected in 98% and 91% of the samples, respectively, while PFOS was detected in 79%. ΣPFAS concentrations in each analysed tissue ranged from 0.3 to 85 ng/g ww, with the latter being detected in the liver of angular roughshark (Oxynotus centrina). On average, PFASs were found to be accumulated in tissues in the following order: gonads > heart > liver ≈ gills > muscle. Relative contribution (%) of individual compounds to ΣPFAS concentration varied among the different shark tissues, and also among the different shark species. No correlation between PFASs levels in tissues and sharks’ gender, length and geographical origin was observed. This is the first study providing PFASs data in sharks collected from Greece and the first study comparing concentrations and patterns in 85 individual tissues from 9 different shark species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.05.120,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Persistent organic pollutants;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Organ Specificity;Tissue Distribution;animal;concentration (parameter);Ecosystems;female;fluorocarbon;male;Marine biology;Marine pollution;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;Organic pollutants;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;persistent organic pollutant;animal tissue;water pollutant;Histology;geographic distribution;Mediterranean Sea;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;concentration (composition);marine environment;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;surfactant;procedures;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;Tissue;muscle;tissue distribution;perfluorononanoic acid;Tissue engineering;perfluoroheptanoic acid;perfluoropentanoic acid;perfluorotetradecanoic acid;metabolism;limit of quantitation;limit of detection;correlation;detection method;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid;Tissue distributions;liver level;shark;sea food;Seafood;Greece;perfluorodecanesulfonic acid;heart;persistence;Tissue distribution;Water Pollutants;Chondrichthyes;gonad;antibody specificity;Chemical;gill;skate (fish);Skates (Fish);environmental;Sharks;finfish;domestic chemicals;industrial;Mediterranean sea;angular roughshark;bluntnose sixgill shark;Eastern Mediterranean sea;elasmobranch;Geographical origins;giant devil ray;Mediterranean Sea (East);Oxynotus centrina;Relative contribution;sharpnose sevengill shark;smooth hammerhead shark,NA,NA

So far, studies generally focused on individual effects of POPs, and do not directly link POP concentrations in prey species to population-specific parameters. In this study we therefore aimed to estimate the effect of legacy POPs and mercury on population growth rate of nineteen polar bear subpopulations. We modelled population development in three scenarios, based on species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) derived for POPs based on ecotoxicity data for endothermic species. In the first scenario, ecotoxicity data for polar bears were based on the HC50 (the concentration at which 50% of the species is affected). The other two scenarios were based on the HC5 and HC95. Considerable variation in effects of POPs could be observed among the scenarios. In our intermediate scenario, we predicted subpopulation decline for ten out of 15 polar bear subpopulations. The estimated population growth rate was least reduced in Gulf of Boothia and Foxe Basin. On average, PCB concentrations in prey (in mu g/g toxic equivalency (TEQ)) posed the largest threat to polar bear subpopulations, with negative modelled population growth rates for the majority of sub populations. We did not find a correlation between modelled population changes and monitored population trends for the majority of chemical-subpopulation combinations. Modelled population growth rates increased over time, implying a decreasing effect of PCBs, DDTs, and mercury. Polar bear subpopulations are reportedly still declining in four out of the seven subpopulations for which sufficient long-term monitoring data is available, as reported by the IUCN-PBSG. This implies that other emerging pollutants or other anthropogenic stressors may affect polar bear subpopulations. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

In this work, 26 sediment samples were collected from Dianchi Lake in China and ten PFCs compounds were measured. The concentrations of the total PFCs (∑PFCs) in the sediments ranged from 0.21 to 2.45ngg-1dw (dry weight), with an average value of 0.95ngg-1dw. PFOS was the most abundant compound among the ten PFCs with the average concentration of 0.33ngg-1dw, followed by PFOA at 0.21ngg-1dw. A two-dimensional HCA (hierarchical cluster analysis) heat map was depicted to analyze the spatial variation of individual PFCs compound and the possible origins in the sediments. Two groups were clustered by HCA, showing the possible source categories (PFOS-cluster and PFOA-cluster). Additionally, PCA-MLR, PMF and Unmix models were employed to quantitatively calculate the contribution of extracted sources. Three models concluded consistent results that PFOS-factor and PFOA-factor were the two main source categories for PFCs in the sediments. The contribution percentages were 43% (PCA-MLR), 48% (PMF) and 46% (Unmix) from the former source, and were 54% (PCA-MLR), 43% (PMF) and 44% (Unmix) from the latter source, respectively. The findings and the approaches used in this work can provide useful information for further study of source apportionment for PFCs in sediments and other environmental compartments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.06.001,"Fluorocarbons;Environmental Monitoring;China;controlled study;perfluoro compound;Perfluorinated compounds;article;sediment;lake;Lakes;aquatic environment;Geologic Sediments;Sediments;Polymerase Chain Reaction;concentration (parameters);pollutant source;dry weight;sediment pollution;fluorine;Principal Component Analysis;numerical model;Cluster Analysis;multivariate analysis;Water Pollutants;Multivariate Analysis;Chemical;Models;Statistical;Theoretical;Source apportionment;cluster analysis;Cluster analysis;Hierarchical systems;Unmix;Factor Analysis;Dianchi Lake;PCA-MLR;PMF;Yunnan;Factor Analysis, Statistical",NA,NA
