However, the impacts of PFAS-related risk assessment on root and rhizosphere microbiomes are still poorly understood. Objective: Researched on Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana growing in contaminated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA) and their mixtures. Results: (i) Bioaccumulation of PFAS in roots was positively correlated with carbon chain length, contamination levels and exposure time, the phytotoxicity was as follows: HFPO-DA < (PFOA + HFPO-DA) < PFOA; (ii) Both short-term and long-term accumulation of PFAS would affect the changes in root antioxidant system and physiological metabolism; (iii) Single or mixed contamination of PFAS had unique influences on rhizosphere microbial diversity, community composition and interspecies interaction, and mixture was more complex. More importantly, the performance of Sphingomonadaceae and Rhizobiaceae microbial communities could contribute to the practice of phyto-microbial soil remediation. Future direction: Pay more attention on novel pollution pathway in cultivation, exposure levels for different plants (especially crops), as well as more exact and scientific risk assessments.

In all individuals and in all tissues, PFOS was the predominant PFAS, accounting for on average 90% of the measured PFAS load. PFOS concentrations were the highest in liver (327 +/- 351 ng/g wet wt) and kidney (147 +/- 262 ng/g wet wt) tissue, and lower in blubber (18 +/- 8 ng/g wet wt), muscle (41 +/- 50 ng/g wet wt), and brain (24 +/- 23 ng/g wet wt). No significant differences could be determined between males and females, nor between juvenile and adult animals (p > 0.05). Perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, and perfluorododecanoic acid could be detected in liver tissue of approximately 25% of the individuals. Perfluorobutane sulfonate, perfluorobutanoic acid, and perfluorooctanoic acid were not detected in any of the porpoise livers. Although we investigated a potential intraspecies segregation according to the source of prey, using stable isotopes, no statistically significant correlation between PFOS concentrations and stable isotopes could be determined. It is, however, noteworthy that the contamination by PFOS in the Black Sea harbor porpoises is comparable to levels found in porpoises from the German Baltic Sea and from coastal areas near Denmark and, therefore, might pose a threat to this population.",NA,10.1021/es060827e,African Continental Ancestry Group;Sulfones,NA,NA

Urban and industrial discharges have been identified as major contributors to current ambient levels of PFASs in near-source environments, while a number of studies have also highlighted the contribution of known fluorochemical point sources to regional contamination hotspots. In these near-source regions, the high PFAS contamination observed in sediments and soils has been attributed to the proximity of airports and fire-training facilities using aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs), discharges from nearby fluorochemical production facilities, accidental spills, and application of contaminated WWTP biosolids to agricultural farmlands. In the case of the biosolids-applied farmlands, significant PFAS contamination was limited not only to soils, but was also observed in the plants and groundwater collected in the vicinity. In addition, since the early 2000s, China has emerged as a major fluorochemical producer, especially after the production phase-out of perfluorooctylsulfonyl (POSF)-based materials in North America in 2000-2002. This shift in the fluorochemical industry is reflected in global environmental surveys in which sediments, WWTP sludge, and soil sampled in China and other Asian-Pacific countries often exhibit the highest PFAS concentrations compared to those observed in Europe and North America. © 2014 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

However, such partitioning is poorly understood for chiral chemicals, many of which exhibit differential bioaccumulation and toxicity potential between enantiomers. In this study, the enantiospecific liposome-water and bovine serum albumin (BSA)-water partition coefficients (Klip/w and KBSA/w, determined at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively) were measured by equilibrium dialysis for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and three beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol, and sotalol). Raman and fluorescence analyses and molecular docking were conducted to provide additional insights into the partitioning process. Results showed alpha- and beta-HBCD displayed stronger enantioselective partitioning to liposomes with the (-)-form, while (-)-alpha-HBCD, R-(+)-pmpranolol, R(+)-metoprolol, and E2-sotalol favored partitioning to BSA compared with their antipodes. Raman spectra revealed alpha- and gamma-HBCD enhanced and reduced the organization of liposome acyl chains, respectively, and polar interactions enhanced the liposome partitioning of beta-blockers. Fluorescence spectra indicated the changed tryptophan microenvironment might influence the BSA steric effect toward HBCD, and electrostatic interactions dominated the formation of BSA-beta-blocker complexes. Molecular docking results supported the difference in the thermodynamic nature of interaction between the studied enantiomers and BSA.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128499,Phospholipids,NA,NA

In this study, a novel MOF-808 metal–organic framework (MOF) was prepared and evaluated for adsorptive removal of PFOS from aqueous solution. The MOF-808 had high specific surface area (SSA; 1610 m2/g) and was structurally stable in aqueous medium for 7 days under different pH conditions. The MOF-808 reached PFOS adsorption equilibrium within 30 min (at 500 mg/L initial PFOS) and attained the maximum adsorption capacity of 939 mg/g at pH 4.1 – 5.4 (with 50 – 500 mg/L initial PFOS). The PFOS adsorption capacity of MOF-808 was unaffected at pH 2 to 7, but gradually decreased at pH > 7. High SSA, favorable pore size and abundant active adsorption sites on MOF-808 triggered high PFOS adsorption onto the adsorbent. The PFOS adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous in nature. Electrostatic interaction between the cationic central cluster ([Zr6O4(OH)4]12+) of MOF-808 and PFOS anion was identified as the key mechanism of PFOS adsorption onto MOF-808, as evident from the infrared spectroscopic investigation of the adsorbent. This study suggests that MOF-808 can be considered as a highly efficient adsorbent for PFOS removal from water and warrants future research to evaluate the application and performance of the material under wastewater conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.jcis.2022.05.050,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Adsorption;ecosystem;Ecosystem;Ecosystems;fluorocarbon;chemistry;hydrogen bond;molecular size;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Organometallics;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;procedures;adsorbent;adsorption;human;metal organic framework;water;polyfluoroalkyl substance;Contaminants of emerging concern;Contaminants of emerging concerns;aqueous solution;pH;water treatment;Water;temperature sensitivity;complex formation;Water treatment;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Human health;decomposition;Water Purification;Per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances;thermodynamics;water management;adsorption kinetics;crystal structure;thermogravimetry;Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs);Pore size;Adsorptive removal;isotherm;Metal-organic framework;Metal-Organic Frameworks;Adsorption capacities;Ecosystem health;Harmful effects;pore size;zirconium derivative;zirconium oxide;Sulfones;Metals,NA,NA

PFAS concentrations generally increased from ∼1969 to ∼1990s-2010 (depending on target and site) and thereafter plateaued or declined, with perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) declining faster than most perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The net result was a shift in the PFAS profile from PFOS-dominant in 1969-2010 to an increased prevalence of PFCAs over the last decade. Further, during the entire period higher PFAS concentrations were generally observed in coastal populations, possibly due to differences in diet and/or proximity to more densely populated areas. Fluorine mass balance determination in pooled samples from three of the regions (2019-2021) indicated that target PFAS accounted for the vast majority (i.e. 81-100%) of extractable organic fluorine (EOF). Nevertheless, high resolution mass-spectrometry-based suspect screening identified 55 suspects (31 at a confidence level [CL] of 1-3 and 24 at a CL of 4-5), of which 43 were substances not included in the targeted analysis. Semi-quantification of CL ≤ 2 suspects increased the identified EOF to >90% in coastal samples.

The contamination had been previously ascribed to a fluorochemical manufacturing plant that discharged mainly perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), among other PFASs, into the surrounding environment. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most abundant compound, detected in almost 99% of the fish with an average concentration of 9.23 mu g/kg wet weight (w/w). Other detected compounds were perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA) (98%, 0.55 mu g/kg w/w), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) (98%, 2.87 mu g/kg w/w), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) (93%, 1.51 mu g/kg w/w), and PFOA (79%, 0.33 mu g/kg w/w). Bioaccumulation of PFASs was species related, with Italian barbel being the most contaminated, followed by chub, wels catfish, and carp, reflecting animals' habitat use and feeding behavior. A significant negative linear relation between PFAS concentration and fish weight was observed no matter the considered species, with smaller fish having proportionally higher bioaccumulation. PFOS concentrations were strongly correlated with the concentrations of other PFASs, suggesting a similar source of contamination or a contamination from ubiquitous sources. Correlation analysis showed PFOA likely originated from a separated source, unlinked to other PFASs. Although the fishes studied are not usually consumed by local people, with the likely exception of freshwater anglers (and relatives), their consumption has been banned by Veneto Authority since the time this study was conducted. In fact, the study suggests that a medium/high consumption frequency (superior to 1 portion per month) of fish from the investigated area might result in a high exposure to PFASs.",NA,10.1007/s11356-021-17236-5,Italy,NA,NA

These countries were chosen as representatives of the diet in South America, Western Asia, Mediterranean countries and South-Eastern Europe. The analysis of foodstuffs was carried out by turbulent flow chromatography (TFC) combined with liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS) using electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative mode. The analytical method was validated for the analysis of different foodstuff classes (cereals, fish, fruit, milk, ready-to-eat foods, oil and meat). The analytical parameters of the method fulfill the requirements specified in the Commission Recommendation 2010/161/EU. Recovery rates were in the range between 70% and 120%. For all the selected matrices, the method limits of detection (MLOD) and the method limits of quantification (MLOQ) were in the range of 5 to 650. pg/g and 17 to 2000. pg/g, respectively. In general trends, the concentrations of PFASs were in the pg/g or pg/mL levels. The more frequently detected compounds were perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). The prevalence of the eight-carbon chain compounds in biota indicates the high stability and bioaccumulation potential of these compounds. But, at the same time, the high frequency of the shorter chain compounds is also an indication of the use of replacement compounds in the new fluorinated materials. When comparing the compounds profile and their relative abundances in the samples from diverse origin, differences were identified. However, in absolute amounts of total PFASs no large differences were found between the studied countries. Fish and seafood were identified as the major PFASs contributors to the diet in all the countries. The total sum of PFASs in fresh fish and seafood was in the range from the MLOQ to 28. ng/g ww.According to the FAO-WHO diets composition, the daily intake (DI) of PFASs was calculated for various age and gender groups in the different diets.

Objectives: We sought to describe PFAS serum concentrations' temporal trends among Gullah African American residents of coastal South Carolina. Methods: Longitudinal measures of PFAS in blood serum from a Gullah clinical sample, without lupus, were examined using spaghetti plots and visit-to-visit change scores (e.g., differences in concentrations between visits) among the 68 participants with repeated measures available. We also modeled population-level trends among the 71 participants with any data using proportionate percentile models, accounting for clustering through robust standard errors. In a post-hoc analysis we examined heterogeneity of temporal trends by age through mixed-effects models for the log-transformed PFAS compounds. Results: Population concentrations of PFOS dropped approximately 9 (95% CI: 8, 10) percent each year over 2003-2013. This was concordant with individual PFOS trajectories (median PFOS change score -21.7 ng/g wet weight, interquartile range of PFOS change scores: -32.8, -14.9) and reports for other populations over this time period. Several other compounds including PFOA, PFHxS, and PFuNDA also showed a population-level decrease. However, examination of individual trajectories suggested substantial heterogeneity. Post-hoc analyses indicated that PFAS trajectories were heterogeneous by age. Conclusions: Many PFAS compounds are decreasing in a sample of Gullah African Americans from coastal South Carolina. There may be age differences in the elimination kinetics of PFASs. The possible role of age as a modifier of PFAS serum trends merits further research. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2015.03.012,PFAS;Biomonitoring;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Article;Adolescent;Chromatography;High Pressure Liquid;Environmental Exposure;United States;Child;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;biological monitoring;blood analysis;controlled study;biological marker;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;alkyl group;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;South Carolina;surfactant;high performance liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;human;serum;Adult;aged;Aged;child;middle aged;Middle Aged;adolescent;Longitudinal Studies;longitudinal study;young adult;Young Adult;priority journal;blood;age;analysis;PFOA;organic pollutant;temporal analysis;health risk;statistical model;African American;heterogeneity;African Americans;aging;Aging;Charleston Harbor;coastal zone;Contaminant trends;Gullah;indigenous population;numerical model;population decline;resident population;statistics;Models;Statistical;numerical data,NA,NA

In this study, surface water and aquatic invertebrates at three Swedish sites impacted by PFAS point sources were characterized, using homologue, isomer and extractable organofluorine (EOF) profiling as well as estimation of bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) and mass discharge. Two sites were impacted by fire training (sites A and R) and the third by industrial runoff (site K). Mean Σ25PFASs concentration in water was 1920 ng L-1 at site R (n = 3), which was more than 20- and 10-fold higher than those from sites A and K, respectively. PFOS was the most predominant PFAS in all waters samples, constituting 29-79% of Σ25PFAS concentrations. Several branched isomers were detected and they substantially contributed to concentrations in surface water (e.g. 49-78% of ΣPFOS) and aquatic invertebrates (e.g. 15-28% of ΣPFOS). BAFs in the aquatic invertebrates indicated higher bioaccumulation for long chain PFASs and lower bioaccumulation for branched PFOS isomers compared to linear PFOS. EOF mass balance showed that Σ25target PFASs in water could explain up to 55% of EOF at site R. However, larger proportions of EOF (>92%) remained unknown in water from sites A and K. Mass discharges were for the first time estimated for EOF and revealed that high amounts of EOF (e.g. 8.2 g F day-1 at site A) could be transported by water to recipient water bodies relative to Σ25PFASs (e.g. 0.15 g day-1 at site A). Overall, we showed that composition profiling, BAFs and EOF mass balance can improve the characterization of PFASs around point sources. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA,10.1039/c9em00281b,Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;Surface waters;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Sweden;Bioaccumulation;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;chemistry;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;flame retardant;Flame Retardants;procedures;sea water;water sampling;organofluorine derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;metabolism;ground water;organic compound;lake water;Isomers;isomer;deferiprone;oxidation;Aquatic invertebrates;seasonal variation;fresh water;Aquatic Organisms;aquatic species;surface property;flow rate;catchment;Fresh Water;water content;Branched isomers;Plants (botany);surface water;Water Pollutants;Invertebrates;invertebrate;Chemical;runoff;Bioaccumulation factor;Organofluorine;Mass-discharge;aquatic invertebrate;hydrology;Point sources;Discharge (fluid mechanics);Fire training,NA,NA

In this study, water and sediment samples collected from 26 sites in Dianchi Lake, a plateau urban lake in the southwestern part of China were analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for ten analytes involving nine perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFOAs) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). Total levels of PFCs were 30.98±32.19ngL-1 in water and 0.95±0.63ngg-1 in sediment. In water samples PFOA was the dominant PFC contaminant, with concentrations ranging from 3.41 to 35.44ngL-1, while in sediments PFOS was the main PFC contaminant at levels from 0.07-0.83ngg-1 dry weight. Field-based sediment water distribution coefficients (KD) were calculated and corrected for organic carbon content (Koc), which reduced variability among samples. The logKoc ranged from 2.54 to 3.57 for C8-C12 perfluorinated carboxylic acids, increasing by 0.1-0.4 log units with each additional CF2 moiety. The logKoc of PFOS was 3.35±0.32. Magnitudes and trends in logKD or logKoc appeared to agree well with previously published laboratory data. Results showed that different PFC composition profiles were observed for samples from the lake water and sediments, indicating the presence of dissimilar characteristics of the PFCs compounds, which is important for PFC fate modeling and risk assessment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.103,chemical pollutant;China;unclassified drug;controlled study;perfluoro compound;Mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;urban area;water pollution;high performance liquid chromatography;liquid chromatography;tandem mass spectrometry;risk assessment;Risk assessment;mass spectrometry;water sampling;article;carboxylic acid;Perfluorinated carboxylic acids;lake;Lakes;Carboxylic acids;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids;Lake pollution;lake water;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid derivative;Sediments;organic carbon;Organic carbon;Urban growth;High performance liquid chromatography;High-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometries;sediment pollution;Perfluorinated compound (PFCs);partitioning;lake sediment;Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs);Occurrence;Water supply systems;sediment-water interface;Partition;distribution;Water distribution coefficients;Partitions (building);HPLC-MS/MS;Dianchi Lake;Yunnan;Dianchi lakes;Carboxylic Acids,NA,NA

However, their notable toxicity poses environmental and human health concerns. Detecting trace amounts of these chemicals is crucial to mitigate risks. Electrochemical sensors surpass traditional methods in sensitivity, selectivity, and cost-effectiveness. In this study, a graphene nanosheet-based sensor was developed for detecting perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). Using the Hummer method, graphene nanosheets were synthesized and characterized in terms of morphology, structural ordering, and surface topology. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations determined the molecular interaction of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) with the sensor material. The sensor exhibited high sensitivity (50.75 μA·μM-1·cm-2 for PFOA and 29.58 μA·μM-1·cm-2 for PFDA) and low detection limits (10.4 nM for PFOA and 16.6 nM for PFDA) within the electrode dynamic linearity range of 0.05-500.0 μM (PFOA) and 0.08-500.0 μM (PFDA).

Concentrations of eight PFAs were determined in three species of fish (mullet, shad, and rockfish) and three species of marine invertebrates (blue crab, oyster, and mussel) from Lake Shihwa, Korea. This is an area in which relatively great concentrations of PFAs in water and in adjacent industrial effluents have been reported. PFOS was the dominant PFA in marine organisms and most PFOS concentrations were greater than the sum of all other PFAs. The mean concentrations of PFOS were 8.1 × 10 and 3.6 × 10 ng/g, wet weight in liver and blood of fish, respectively. Perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) were also found in fish, but their concentrations were 10-fold less than those for PFOS. Of the PFCAs measured in fish, concentrations of the longer-chain perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA) were the greatest. Concentrations of PFOS in soft tissues of blue crabs decreased as a function of distance from the shore where inputs from the industrialized areas are discharged into Lake Shihwa. PFOS was the only PFA detectable in mussels and oysters with a mean of 0.5 ± 0.2 and 1.1 ± 0.3 ng/g, wet weight, respectively. Concentrations of PFUnA were positively correlated with perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) in both the liver and blood of fish, which suggests a common source of these two PFCAs in this area.

The heavy-metal levels were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results showed that the levels of Cd, Hg, Cu, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cr, and Sn in the river water exceeded the permissible limits recommended by various international agencies. Some important fatty acids were not detected in the muscle samples of the fish species collected from the highly polluted site (HPS). Caprylic acid (C8:0) and lauric acid (C12:0) were undetectable in Catla catla and Cirrhinus mrigala. Palmitoleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid were present in Catla catla alone, and they were not found in Labeo rohita and Cirrhinus mrigala harvested from a less polluted site (LPS). More saturated fatty acids and less fatty acids were detected in the muscle samples of Catla catla, Labeo rohita, and Cirrhinus mrigala collected from HPS than in those collected from LPS. The untreated discharge of domestic and industrial waste probably causes a reduction in the fatty acids in the biomass of microalgae and zoobenthos and, ultimately, adversely affects the upper links of the food chain in the river.

Here, tissue-specific uptake and depuration kinetics of perfluoroethylcyclohexanesulfonate (PFECHS) and 6:2 and 8:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates (Cl-PFESAs) were studied in marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma). The fish were exposed to these substances for 28 days (0.2 μg/L), followed by a clearance period of 14 days. The depuration constant (kd) of PFECHS [0.103 ± 0.009 day-1 (mean ± standard deviation)] was reported for the first time. Among the six studied tissues, the highest concentrations of 6:2 Cl-PFESA, 8:2 Cl-PFESA, and PFECHS were found in the liver [1540, 1230, and 188 ng (g of wet weight)-1, respectively] on day 28 while the longest residence times were found in the eyes (t1/2 values of 21.7 ± 4.3, 23.9 ± 1.5, and 17.3 ± 0.8 days, respectively). No significant positive correlation was found between the bioconcentration factors of the studied PFASs and the phospholipid or protein contents in different tissues of the studied fish. Potential metabolites of Cl-PFESAs, i.e., their hydrogen-substituted analogues (H-PFESAs), were identified by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. However, the biotransformation rates were low (<0.19%), indicating the poor capacity of marine medaka to metabolize Cl-PFESAs to H-PFESAs. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

In this study, 248 size-specific PM samples were collected from 9 Asian cities using a portable 4-stage cascade impactor for the analysis of PFAS. Of the 34 investigated PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were the major compounds. In particular, the emerging PFAS, hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid, was quantified in the PM for the first time, with concentrations ranging from <0.086 to 21.5 pg/m3. Spatially, PFOA and PFOS were the predominant compounds in China, while precursors, emerging PFAS, and short-chain PFAS dominated in India, Japan, and South Korea, respectively. Seasonal variations of PFAS may be controlled by regional climate, local or seasonal emission sources, and long-range transport of air masses. Size-dependent distribution was investigated, showing that the majority of PFAS predominantly affiliated in fine particles, while PFOS and its alternatives tended to attach on coarser particles. Moreover, PFOS distributed on specific sizes exhibited seasonal and regional dependency, while no such patterns were observed for PFOA. These findings will provide useful information on the geographical and size-dependent distribution of PFAS in the atmospheric PM. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.0c03387,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Article;China;India;Japan;concentration (parameter);fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;chemical substance;perfluoroalkanoic acid;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;spatial distribution;South Korea;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;Long range transport;Hexafluoropropylene oxide;hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid;Republic of Korea;organofluorine derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;Particle size analysis;particle size;seasonal variation;measurement;atmospheric pollution;Asia;Cities;city;airborne particle;atmosphere;Seasonal variation;atmospheric particulate matter;Atmospheric particulate matter;Cascade impactors;climate;Meteorological instruments;Seasonal emissions;seasonality;Seasons,NA,NA

The hepatic concentrations of ∑All in river otters collected downstream of a fluoropolymer production facility located along the Ohio River were 2-fold higher than those in other watersheds. The median whole body burden of ∑All was calculated to be 1580 μg.

The concentrations of ∑PFAAs in source water ranged from 1.0 to 107.0 ng·L−1, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) dominating. Correlation analysis and a principal component analysis-multiple linear regression model (PCA-MLR) collectively identified potential pollutant sources and quantified the contributions. In the wet season, fluoropolymer production, fabric and textile industries, and food packaging were the most polluted (99.07%), followed by the metal-plating industry and atmospheric deposition sources (0.93%); in the dry season, fluoropolymer production, fabric and textile industries, and food packaging were still the most polluted (47.96%), followed by atmospheric deposition (33.1%) and the metal-plating industry (18.94%).

A method was proposed for the determination of 17 target PFAA analytes in marine sediment samples (n = 49) collected from the Yangtze Estuary and East China Sea. The proposed method involves the use of an optimized pretreatment procedure and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mode. The method relied on extraction cycles using methanol followed by concentration, filtration, and small volume injection to UHPLC-MS/MS. The recovery, time efficiency, and detection limit of the proposed method are improved relative to those of traditional methods. Limits of detection varied from 0.003 to 0.045 ng/g, and spike recoveries to sediment ranged from 90% to 110% with suitable precisions (1.7%–14.6%). PFAAs were widely present in the samples, and ΣPFAAs ranged from 0.67 ng/g dw to 36.75 ng/g dw. Results indicated that terrigenous input strongly influences PFAA distribution in sediments from the study areas.

This paper systematically studied the distribution and transport of PFAAs in agricultural soil, irrigation water and precipitation, followed by crop bioaccumulation and finally human exposure of PFAAs within a 10 km radius around a mega-fluorochemical industrial park (FIP). Hotspots of contamination by PFAAs were found near the FIP and downstream of the effluent discharge point with the maximum concentrations of 641 ng/g in agricultural soil, 480 ng/g in wheat grain, 58.8 ng/g in maize grain and 4,862 ng/L in precipitation. As the distance increased from the FIP, PFAAs concentrations in all media showed a sharp initial decrease followed by a moderate decline. Elevated PFAA concentrations in soil and grains were still present within a radius of 10 km of the FIP. The soil contamination was associated with the presence of PFAAs in irrigation water and precipitation, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant PFAA component in soil. However, due to bioaccumulation preference, short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), especially perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), became the major PFAA contaminants in grains of wheat and maize. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for both grains showed a decrease with increasing chain length of PFAAs (approximately 0.5 log decrease per CF2 group). Compared to maize grain, wheat grain showed higher BAFs, possibly related to its higher protein content. The PFCA (C4-C8) concentrations (on a log10 basis) in agricultural soil and grain were found to show a linear positive correlation.

Because of the associated practices, the flows of several environmental pollutants into the organic products threaten food safety and human health. The contaminants that occur at higher concentrations in organic produce include persistent organic pollutants (61.3–436.9 ng g⁻¹ lamb meat, and 0.28 pg g⁻¹-2.75 ng g⁻¹ bovine meat), heavy metals (0.5–33.0 mg kg⁻¹ lettuce), organochlorine pesticides (11–199 μg g⁻¹ carrots), cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexabromocyclododecane (2–3 times higher than in conventionally produced porcine meat), hexachlorobenzene (1.38–14.49 ng g⁻¹ fat in milk), and non-brominated flame retardants (1.3–3.2 times higher than in conventional produce of greenhouse-grown tomato and cucumber). Moreover, some pollutants like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances with a longer half-life (1.50–9.10 yrs) are reported to occur in several organic products. In fact, several legacy persistent organic pollutants are known for their significant trophic magnification in an urban terrestrial ecosystem. In addition, many plant functionalities are adversely affected in organic farming. Therefore, the long-term usage of organic products containing such pollutants poses a significant threat to human health. The major limitation in organic livestock production is the severe shortage of organic feed. Several variable standards and technical regulations set by the government and private agencies are the major obstacles in the global marketing of organic products. The present review critically addresses the impact of organic farming on hidden risks due to the use of composts as the amendment resources that enhance the phytoaccumulation and trophic transfer of pollutants, the functional diversity of the ecosystems, and poor harmonization among the policies and regulations in different countries for organic farming.

Wide-scope target and suspect screening techniques were used on a single guillemot egg, providing novel information on contaminants of emerging concern. Stable isotope ratio analysis showed that guillemots from Great Saltee Island and Lambay Island (Ireland's east coast) had a similar carbon source (delta C-13) and fed at similar trophic levels (delta N-15), pollutant levels were higher in eggs from Lambay Island near Dublin, Ireland's industrialised capital city.

The concentrations of total 12 PFASs in water of the Guanting Reservoir were higher than that from the Yongding Watershed, with mean of 48.9 and 33.7 ng/L, respectively. The concentrations of PFASs in sediment of the Yongding Watershed and the Guanting Reservoir were similar, with mean of 1.01 and 0.827 ng/g dry weight, respectively. Detected levels of PFASs in the Guanting Reservoir significantly increased during the past eight years, possibly due to an improving economy and a rapidly developed service industry. Moderate PFASs levels in fish of the Guanting Reservoir were detected relative to other lakes and reservoirs. The daily intake of PFASs via fish and water ranged from 4.96 to 15.0 ng/kg bw/day, with higher levels found in children relative to adults. In total, approximately 9.06 kg of PFASs from riverine flow and atmospheric deposition annually entered the Guanting Reservoir.

To address these issues, one approach is to target a subset of metabolites that share a functional group, such as ketones and aldehydes, using chemoselective tagging. Here we report a greatly improved chemoselective method for the quantitative analysis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbonyl-containing metabolites directly in biological samples. This method is based on direct tissue or cells extraction with simultaneous derivatization of stable and labile carbonylated metabolites using N-[2-(aminooxy) ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecylammonium (QDA) and (CD3)-C-13 labeled QDA. We combined innovations of direct quenching of biological sample with frozen derivatization conditions under the catalyst N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, which facilitated the formation of oxime stable-isotope ion pairs differing by m/z 4.02188 while minimizing metabolite degradation. The resulting oximes were extracted by HyperSep C8 tips to remove interfering compounds, and the products were detected using nano-electrospray ionization interfaced with a Thermo Fusion mass spectrometer. The quaternary ammonium tagging greatly increased electrospray MS detection sensitivity and the signature ions pairs enabled simple identification of carbonyl compounds. The improved method showed the lower limits of quantification for carbonyl standards to be in the range of 0.20-2 nM, with linearity of R-2 > 0.99 over 4 orders of magnitude. We have applied the method to assign 66 carbonyls in mouse tumor tissues, many of which could not be assigned solely by accurate mass and tandem MS. Fourteen of the metabolites were quantified using authentic standards.

In total, 83 emerging PFASs from 14 classes were identified, 22 of which were reported for the first time. Authentic standards were synthesized for 13 per- and polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs), thereby greatly expanding the scope of PFAS-targeted monitoring.

PFOS and long-chained PFCAs (C9-C13) increased significantly over the whole period (2.8% yr(-1) to 8.3% yr(-1)), but FOSA declined by 13% yr(-1) after 2006. Results from FOSA partitioning and bioaccumulation modeling forced by changes in atmospheric inputs reasonably capture magnitudes and temporal patterns in FOSA concentrations measured in pilot whales. Rapid changes in atmospheric FOSA in polar and subpolar regions around 2000 helps to explain large declines in PFOS exposure for species that metabolize FOSA, including seafood consuming human populations.

Ecotoxicology endpoints used in regulatory guidelines may not reflect multiple, low-level but persistent stressors. This study examines the biological effects of PFAS on Eastern short-necked turtles in Queensland, Australia. In this study, blood samples were collected and analysed for PFAS, hormone levels, and functional omics endpoints. High levels of PFAS were found in turtles at the impacted site, with PFOS being the dominant constituent. The PFAS profiles of males and females differed, with males having higher PFAS concentrations. Hormone concentrations differed between impacted and reference sites in male turtles, with elevated testosterone and corticosterone indicative of stress. Further, energy utilisation, nucleotide synthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and amino acid synthesis were altered in both male and female turtles from PFAS-impacted sites. Both sexes show similar metabolic responses to environmental stressors from the PFAS-contaminated site, which may adversely affect their reproductive fitness. Purine metabolism, caffeine metabolism, and ferroptosis pathway changes in turtles can cause gout, cell death, and overall health problems. Further, the study showed that prolonged exposure to elevated PFAS levels in the wild could compromise turtle reproductive fitness by disrupting reproductive steroids and metabolic pathways. © 2024 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171743,PFAS;Biomonitoring;Ecology;Article;ecosystem;female;male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;biomonitoring;controlled study;corticosterone;bioaccumulation;animal tissue;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;protein;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;blood sampling;ecotoxicology;blood;Exposed to;turtle;metabolism;mass fragmentography;glucose;hormone;hormone determination;chromatography by mobile phase;organofluorine;calcium;Australia;Metabolism;electrospray;cholesterol;biological activity;Wildlife;inorganic compound;phosphate;albumin;aspartate aminotransferase;lipidomics;globulin;Eco-toxicology;Queensland;energy metabolism;isotope dilution assay;metabolomics;Metabolomics;fitness;hydrocortisone;cellular distribution;Fresh Water;urea;hormone blood level;testosterone;cell death;amino acid synthesis;purine metabolism;nitrogen metabolism;omics;proteomics;Cell death;ferroptosis;'omics';ammonium fluoride;bile acid;caffeine;DNA extraction;glutamate dehydrogenase;Hormone disruption;nucleotide metabolism;Omic-based ecosurveillance;Omics-based ecosurveillance;per fluoroalkyl substance;poly fluoroalkyl substance;reproductive fitness;wild caught freshwater turtles,NA,NA

To understand the impact and potential risks of intense human activities on these dolphins, factors related to the mortality of humpback dolphins in the PRE were investigated by a detailed examination of 343 dolphin specimens stranded during 2003–2017. There was a significant (p < 0.01) increasing trend for humpback dolphin stranding, reflecting the accelerating rate of the population decline. A large proportion of strandings (35.88%) were neonates. A low recruitment rate implies slow population growth, and hence, limited capacity to resist anthropogenic stress. The most commonly diagnosed causes of death were vessel collision and net entanglement. The concentrations of trace metals, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and most of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the dolphin samples were greater than those previously reported in cetaceans globally. Furthermore, Cu, PCB77, PCB169, PCB81, PCB37, and PFASs (excluding PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHxDA, and PFODA) were the major pollutants accumulated in neonates. 67% of PCB, 78% of Cu, and 100% of perfluorooctane sulfonate concentrations in the neonates exceeded the threshold for toxicological effects in marine mammals, suggesting that these compounds could be important factors contributing to the low survival rate of calves in this area. This study revealed that vessel transportation, fishing activities, and pollutant bioaccumulation are the three major causes of humpback dolphin mortality in the PRE. These results highlight the need for more efforts to restrict anthropogenic activities, especially vessel traffic, the catching of these marine animals and fishing, and pollutant discharge, in order to prevent vulnerable species from continuous population decline and further extinction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119526,Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;Rivers;Animals;Article;China;animal;ecosystem;fluorocarbon;Marine pollution;nonhuman;controlled study;Organic pollutants;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;animal tissue;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Mammals;principal component analysis;environmental management;risk assessment;PCB;Polychlorinated biphenyls;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;mortality;growth rate;chemical analysis;toxicological parameters;chlorphenotane;river;Estuaries;estuary;Contaminant exposure;PAH;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;polychlorinated biphenyl derivative;Fisheries;survival rate;environmental protection;environmental impact;Population statistics;Guangdong;DDT;Trace elements;trace metal;population decline;human activity;anthropogenic effect;population growth;serpacwa;immunosuppressive treatment;Multiple stressors;dolphin;Dolphins (structures);Dolphins;toothed whale;cetacean;hydrology;Pearl River estuary;Zhujiang Estuary;Anthropic activities;Anthropic activity;atmospheric pressure;Cause of mortality;Contaminants exposure;echolocation;Humpback dolphins;Indo-pacific humpback dolphin;Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins;Population decline;Sousa chinensis;Strandings,NA,NA

Among these, there are the so-called persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which constitute a heterogenic group of chemical substances of environmental concern. POPs are persistent, can bioaccumulate and biomagnificate, have toxic effects and have potential for LRT, and through atmospheric deposition followed by partitioning and other biogeochemical processes accumulate in Antarctic soils, ice, snow, seawater and biota. Both climatic and biogeochemical factors influence the reservoir potential of the different Antarctic compartments, but there are a number of processes, especially those implying amplification, that have received little attention for all POPs, both legacy and emerging. For legacy POPs, there has been a remarkable assessment of the cycling in the ocean, including polar regions. However, for other POPs having different sources and properties, such as the organophosphate esters (OPEs) and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), little is known about the processes that influence their occurrence, transport and fate in the global environment and particularly in remote areas, such as Antarctica. The working hypothesis of this thesis is that the Antarctica, and especially the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP), is a sentinel region for the identification of legacy and emerging POPs, which have the potential to be globally distributed. The overall goal of this thesis was to perform field and conceptual research in order to understand the cycling, accumulation and amplification processes of POPs with diverse physical-chemical properties and sources, such as OPEs and PFAS, in coastal Antarctica, and determine to which extend the AP can act as a sentinel of global pollution.

The bioavailability of PFOSA in the soil with higher TOC content was reduced, resulting in the bioaccumulation factors in wheat and earthworms decreased from (61.24 ± 8.42) and (21347.91 ± 208.86) to (5.61 ± 0.23) and (1404.92 ± 108.21), respectively.

The ratio of branched PFOS isomers (br-PFOS) in the wheat roots was (14.8 ± 2.0)% and (66.1 ± 26.2)% at low and high TOC content, respectively, lower than those in the shoots ((63.0 ± 21.3)% and (85.2 ± 2.4)%), respectively), which might be because it was easier to translocate br-PFOS formed in roots to shoots. The ratio of br-PFOS in wheat, especially in wheat shoots ((85.2 ± 2.4)%), was significantly higher than that in earthworms ((16.5 ± 4.0)%). The presence of wheat enhanced the bioavailability of PFOSA in the soil, thereby promoted the accumulation of PFOSA in earthworms, but had little effect on the transformation of PFOSA.

Additionally, sediment ecotoxicity was investigated. The results of the chemical analysis were used to asses environmental risk of PFASs. In samples collected around discharge collectors from a wastewater treatment plant and the Vistula mouth, Σ17PFASs values were 0.00403 ÷ 40.6 and 0.509 ÷ 614 ng/g d.w., respectively. In samples collected around discharge collectors, PFHxA, PFPeA, PFHpA, and PFOA were dominating, while at the Vistula River mouth, PFHxS, PFDS, and PFBS were prevalent. For most sediments, no toxic effect was observed in the toxicity tests with Heterocypris inconguens and Aliivibrio ficsheri. There was no observed correlation between the PFASs level and their ecotoxicity. Generally, the results of environmental risk assessment indicate that the PFASs would not generate high impact on the aquatic life (five water samples have shown medium risk related to PFBS and PFDoA). © 2020 by the authors.

Several PFAS have been demonstrated to be persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. This study better characterizes the bioaccumulation of PFAS in freshwater fish through a spatial and temporal analysis of surface water and sediment from a stormwater pond in a former Naval air station (NAS) with historic AFFF use. We sampled environmental media from four locations twice per week for five weeks and sampled fish at the end of the sampling effort. The primary PFAS identified in surface water, sediment, and biota were perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) followed by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in environmental media and perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS) in biota. We observed significant temporal variability in surface water concentrations at the pond headwaters following stochastic events such as heavy rainfall for many compounds, particularly PFHxS. Sediment concentrations varied most across sampling locations. In fish, liver tissue presented the highest concentrations for all compounds except PFHxS, which was highest in muscle tissue, suggesting the influence of fine-scale aqueous PFAS fluctuations on tissue distribution. Calculated log bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) ranged from 0.13 to 2.30 for perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCA) and 0.29–4.05 for perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSA) and fluctuated greatly with aqueous concentrations. The variability of PFAS concentrations in environmental media necessitates more frequent sampling efforts in field-based studies to better characterize PFAS contamination in aquatic ecosystems as well as exercising caution when considering single time-point BAFs due to uncertainty of system dynamics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163149,Biochemistry;Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS);Fish;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Carboxylation;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Bioaccumulation;animal;ecosystem;Ecosystem;female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;carbon;nitrogen;bioaccumulation;contamination;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;chemical compound;fish;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;spatiotemporal analysis;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;perflexane;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;Tissue;toxicity;biota;water;Aqueous film forming foams;polyfluoroalkyl substance;tissue distribution;sediment;perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid;lake;Lakes;aquatic environment;sampling;perfluoroalkyl carboxylate;Sediments;Fishes;perfluoroheptane sulfonate;polymer;environmental factor;Water;Alkanesulfonates;surface water;Water Pollutants;Sediment;Chemical;Aquatic ecosystems;Perfluorooctane sulphonate;Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS);Bioaccumulation factor;freshwater fish;largemouth bass;Sulphonates;Aquatic toxicology;bioaccumulation factor;Perfluorohexane sulphonate;AFFF;Environmental medium;freshwater sediment;Lepomis macrochirus;pond;Ponds;Rain;retention basin;Sampling efforts;Stochastic systems,NA,NA

Methods: The sample was extracted by ion-pair extraction (IPE) method and analyzed by Shimadzu HPLCMSMS 8040. Besides, the Total Daily Intake (TDI) of PFASs and potential risk of human exposure by freshwater fish consumption in several scenarios were investigated. Results: The greatest total PFASs concentration in each fish tissue was found as 925 ng/mL in a crucian carp (Carassius auratus) for blood, 598 ng/g ww in a Korea piscivorous chub (Opsariichthys uncirostris) for liver, 283 ng/g ww in a crucian carp (Carassius auratus) for egg, and 129 ng/g ww in a skygager (Erythroculter erythropterus) for muscle. The greatest mean concentration of PFOS was determined in blood (38.8 ng/mL), followed by egg (22.0 ng/ww), liver (21.1 ng/g ww) and muscle tissues (1.14 ng/g ww). Addition to fish species and tissues, several other factors such as sex, habitat and fish traits, may affect the bioaccumulation of PFASs in fish. The consumption guideline of one meal per week for skygager is strongly applied for skygager caught from a middle stream of Nakdong River watershed. The total daily intake of PFASs by freshwater fish muscle tissues consumption were ranged from 0 to 12.4 ng/kg b.w./day for PFOS and from 0 to 0.05 ng/kg b.w./ day for PFOA. Conclusion: This study firstly reports the tissues distribution and human consumption exposure of PFASs in various edible freshwater fish from major rivers and lakes in Korea.

A biomonitoring program was conducted to assess exposure to over 70 legacy contaminants and contaminants of emerging concern in populations disproportionately at risk for exposure residing near Onondaga Lake and to educate these communities on how to reduce exposures. The populations of focus were refugees from Burma and Bhutan and low-income, primarily African American, anglers (urban anglers). These communities consume locally caught fish for economic as well as cultural reasons and therefore may be at higher risk of exposure. This study focuses on assessment of exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and associations with local fish consumption. Using respondent driven sampling, 311 refugees and 89 urban anglers were enrolled in the study. Following informed consent, study participants provided blood and urine specimens and completed a questionnaire. Percentiles of locally caught fish meals in the past 12 months by race/ethnicity groups showed that the Burmese participants of Karen ethnicity were the highest consumers, with a median of 135 meals compared to 103 meals for the other Burmese participants, 70 meals for the urban anglers, and 44 meals for the Bhutanese participants. Compared to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2015–16 sample of the general U.S. population, the Karen participants had markedly elevated perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) levels with median serum concentrations 9.5 times greater (41.6 ng/mL vs. 4.4 ng/mL) and 26.9 times greater (2.69 ng/mL vs. 0.10 ng/mL), respectively; the other Burmese participants had moderately elevated levels of PFOS and PFDA with median serum concentrations 3.0 times greater (13.3 ng/mL vs. 4.4 ng/mL) and 7.3 greater times greater (0.73 ng/mL vs. 0.10 ng/mL), respectively; and, PFAS levels were not elevated in the Bhutanese or urban angler cohorts. Male gender was consistently the strongest predictor of PFAS exposure among all study cohorts. A positive association between local fish consumption was indicated only for PFOS among urban anglers. An association between local fish consumption and PFAS was not statistically significant among the refugee cohorts, perhaps due to the lack of ‘lower-end’ exposure or exposure variability. Community events were held by the program staff to present the biomonitoring results and distribute community outreach materials with visual aids specific for the study populations to promote safe fish eating. © 2021",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2021.112309,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Biological Monitoring;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Food Contamination;animal;fluorocarbon;male;Male;biological monitoring;food contamination;alkanesulfonic acid;human;nutrition;Nutrition Surveys;Fish consumption;New York;per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS);Fish advisories;Bhutan;Great lakes contaminants,NA,NA

The first generation was exposed to a range of PFOS concentrations from 5 to 5,000 ng/ml and a control through their diet. For the second generation, offspring of the 50 ng/ml PFOS treatment and the control were further reared in a PFOS-free environment.

Although the second generation was not exposed to PFOS, we still observed a reduction in the number of offspring when the parental flies were exposed to 50 ng/ml PFOS.

We detected all of the investigated contaminants in ringed seal blubber with high frequency, the main diet of East Greenland bears, with the exception of OH-PCBs and 4-OH-HpCS, which indicated that these phenolic contaminants were likely of metabolic origin and formed in the bears from accumulated PCBs and octachlorostyrene (OCS), respectively, rather than being bioaccumulated from a seal blubber diet. For all of the detectable sum of classes or individual organohalogens, in general, the ringed seal to polar bear mean BMFs for Sigma PCBs, p,p'-DDE, Sigma CHLs, Sigma MeSO2-PCBs, 3-MeSO2-p,p'-DDE, PCP, Sigma PBDEs, total-(alpha)-HBCD, Sigma OH-PBDEs. Sigma MeO-PBDEs and Sigma OH-PBBs indicated that these organohalogens bioaccumulate, and in some cases there was tissue-specific biomagnification, e.g., BMFs for bear adipose and liver ranged from 2 to 570. The blood-brain barrier appeared to be effective in minimizing brain accumulation as BMFs were <= 1 in the brain, with the exception of Sigma OH-PBBs (mean BMF=93 +/- 54). Unlike OH-PCB metabolites, OH-PBDEs in the bear tissues appeared to be mainly accumulated from the seal blubber rather than being metabolic formed from PBDEs in the bears. In vitro PBDE depletion assays using polar bear hepatic microsomes, wherein the rate of oxidative metabolism of PBDE congeners was very slow, supported the probability that accumulation from seals is the main source of OH-PBDEs in the bear tissues. Our findings demonstrated from ringed seal to polar bears that organohalogen biotransformation, bioaccumulation and/or biomagnification varied widely and depended on the contaminant in question. Our results show the increasing complexity of bioaccumulated and in some cases biomagnified, chlorinated and brominated contaminants and/or metabolites from the diet may be a contributing stress factor in the health of East Greenland polar bears.

For the first time, the PFAA compositions and isomeric profiles of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) were reported in three PFOS and five PFOA commercial products manufactured in China. The purity of the three PFOS products was 76.7-80.6%. The major impurity in the PFOS products is PFOA, which contributes more than 10%. Other impurities include perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorohexanoate (PFHxA) and perfluoroheptanoate acids (PFHpA). The percentage of linear PFOS (n-PFOS) in the three products was 66.2-71.9%, similar to that in the product manufactured by 3M (70.3%).

These isomers are hypothesized to have different biological properties, but no isomer-specific data are currently available. The present study is the first in a two-part project examining PFA isomer-specific uptake, tissue distribution, and elimination in a rodent model. Seven male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single gavage dose of approximately 500 mu g/kg body weight perfluorooctane sulfonate (C8F17SO3-, PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (C 7 F 15 CO 2 H, PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (C8F17CO2H, PFNA) and 30 mu g/kg body weight perfluorohexane sulfonate (C6F13SO3-, PFHxS). Over the subsequent 38 d, urine, feces, and tail- vein blood samples were collected intermittently, while larger blood volumes and tissues were collected on days 3 and 38 for isomer analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). For all PFAs, branched isomers generally had lower blood depuration half-lives than the corresponding linear isomer. The most remarkable exception was for the PFOS isomer containing an alpha-perfluoromethyl branch (1m-PFOS), which was threefold more persistent than linear PFOS, possibly due to steric shielding of the hydrophilic sulfonate moiety. For perfluoromonomethyl-branched isomers of PFOS, a structure-property relationship was observed whereby branching toward the sulfonate end of the perfluoroalkyl chain resulted in increased half-lives. For PFHxS, PFOA, and PFOS, preferential elimination of branched isomers occurred primarily via urine, whereas for PFNA preferential elimination of the isopropyl isomer occurred via both urine and feces. Changes in the blood isomer profiles over time and their inverse correlation to isomer elimination patterns in urine, feces, or both provided unequivocal evidence of significant isomer-specific biological handling. Source assignment based on PFA isomer profiles in biota must therefore be conducted with caution, because isomer profiles are unlikely to be conserved in biological samples.",NA,10.1897/08-239.1,"Rats;Sprague-Dawley;Rats, Sprague-Dawley",NA,NA

This prevalence of use has resulted in its subsequent detection within the environment, wildlife, and humans. Despite this, however, its hepatotoxic effects on aquatic organisms remain unclear. Here, we characterized the impacts of long-term F-53B exposure on adult zebrafish liver and their offspring. Results showed that the concentration of F-53B was greater in the F0 liver than that in the gonads and blood. Furthermore, males had significantly higher liver F-53B levels than females. Hepatomegaly and obvious cytoplasmic vacuolation indicated that F-53B exposure induced liver injury. Compared to control, liver triglyceride levels decreased by 30% and 33.5% in the 5 and 50 μg/L-exposed males and 22% in 50 μg/L-exposed females. Liver transcriptome analysis of F0 adult fish found 2175 and 1267 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 5 μg/L-exposed males and females, respectively. Enrichment analyses further demonstrated that the effects of F-53B on hepatic transcripts were sex-dependent. Gene Ontology showed that most DEGs were involved in multicellular organism development in male fish, whereas in female fish, most DEGs were related to metabolic processes and gene expression. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the PPAR signaling pathway likely contributed to F-53B-induced disruption of lipid metabolism in F0 adult fish. In F1 larvae (5 days post fertilization), the transcription of pparα increased, like that in F0 adult fish, but most target genes showed the opposite expression trends as their parents.

Considering that Florida supports millions population as well as treasured, sensitive coastal and wetland ecosystems, we have expanded the PFAS monitoring study on the occurrence, composition, spatial distribution, and potential sources encompassing tap waters from counties on the West coast of South Florida and Central Florida, and surface waters from Tampa Bay, Everglades National Park adjacent canals, Key West, including Biscayne Bay area.

As increasing PFAS concentrations were found in the south polar skua during the breeding season in Antarctica, we hypothesised that available prey during the breeding period contributes significantly to the PFAS contamination in skuas. To test this, we compared PFAS in south polar skuas and their main prey from two breeding sites on opposite sides of the Antarctic continent: Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) stomach content, eggs, chicks, and adults from Svarthamaren in Dronning Maud Land and Adélie penguin chicks (Pygoscelis adeliae) from Dumont d’Urville in Adélie Land. Of the 22 PFAS analysed, seven were present in the majority of samples, except petrel stomach content [only perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnA) present] and Adélie penguins (only four compounds present), with increasing concentrations from the prey to the skuas. The biomagnification factors (BMFs) were higher at Dumont d’Urville than Svarthamaren. When adjusted to reflect one trophic level difference, the BMFs at Svarthamaren remained the same, whereas the ones at Dumont d’Urville doubled. At both the colonies, the skua PFAS pattern was dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), followed by PFUnA, but differed with the presence of branched PFOS and perfluorotetradecanoate (PFTeA) and lack of perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) at Dumont d’Urville. At Svarthamaren, the pattern in the prey was comparable to the skuas, but with a higher relative contribution of PFTeA in prey. At Dumont d’Urville, the pattern in the prey differed from the skuas, with the domination of PFUnA and the general lack of PFOS in prey. Even though the PFAS levels are low in Antarctic year-round resident prey, the three lines of evidence (pattern, BMF difference, and BMF adjusted to one trophic level) suggest that the Antarctic petrel are the significant source of PFAS in the Svarthamaren skuas, whereas the skuas in Dumont d’Urville have other important sources to PFAS than Adélie penguin, either in the continent or external on the inter-breeding foraging grounds far from Antarctica.

Previous studies focused solely on high PFOS concentrations, disregarding the connection with environmental factors. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the PFOS effects on aquatic ecosystems amidst changing environmental conditions, this study investigated the cellular responses of Microcystis aeruginosa to varying PFOS concentrations under heatwave and nutrient stress conditions. The results showed that PFOS concentrations exceeding 5.0 µg/L had obvious effects on multiple physiological responses of M. aeruginosa, resulting in the suppression of algal cell growth and the induction of oxidative damage. However, PFOS concentration at levels below 20.0 µg/L has been found to enhance the growth of algal cells and trigger significant oxidative damage under heatwave conditions. Heatwave conditions could enhance the uptake of PFOS in algal cells, potentially leading to heightened algal growth when PFOS concentration was equal to or less than 5.0 µg/L. Conversely, deficiency or limitation of nitrogen and phosphorus significantly decreased algal abundance and chlorophyll content, inducing severe oxidative stress that could be mitigated by exposure to PFOS.

Most biomonitoring studies have investigated the PFAS concentrations in indigenous organisms, whereas active biomonitoring has only been used sporadically. In the present study, accumulated PFAS concentrations were measured in indigenous fish, European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and European eel (Anguilla anguilla), and in translocated freshwater mussels (Dreissena bugensis and Corbicula fluminea) at 44 sampling locations within the main water basins of Flanders, the northern part of Belgium. Finally, both human health risk and ecological risk were assessed based on accumulated concentrations in fish muscle.ResultsAmong locations, Sigma PFAS concentrations ranged from 8.56-157 ng/g ww (median: 22.4 ng/g ww) in mussels, 5.22-67.8 ng/g ww (median: 20.8 ng/g ww) in perch, and 5.73-68.8 ng/g ww (median: 22.1 ng/g ww) in eel. Concentrations of PFOA and PFTeDA were higher in mussels compared to fish, whereas for PFDA and PFUnDA the opposite was true. A comparison of concentrations on a wet weight basis between both fish species showed significantly higher PFDoDA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA and PFOA concentrations in eel compared to perch and significantly higher concentrations of PFDA and PFOS in perch. In mussels, PFAS profiles were dominated by PFOA and showed a higher relative contribution of short-chained PFAS, while PFAS profiles in fish were dominated by PFOS. Furthermore, all mussel species clearly occupied a lower trophic level than both fish species, based on a stable isotope analysis.ConclusionsBiomagnification of PFDA, PFUnDA and PFOS and biodilution of PFOA and PFTeDA were observed. Translocated mussels have been proven suitable to determine which PFAS are present in indigenous fish, since similar PFAS profiles were measured in all biota. Finally, mean PFAS concentrations in fish did pose a human health risk for eel, although tolerable daily intake values for perch were close to the reported daily consumption rates in Belgium and exceeded them in highly contaminated locations. Based on the ecological risk of PFOS, the standard was exceeded at about half of the sampling locations (44% for perch and 58% for eel).",NA,10.1186/s12302-021-00477-z,Belgium;Humanism;Humanities;Humans;Poverty,NA,NA

We found that all tested chemicals could bind directly to ERs and exhibit relatively weak agonistic activity toward ERs, suggesting that the ER-mediated signaling pathway is directly involved in the estrogenic effects of CI-PFESAs. The internal dose of 8:2 CI-PFESA was significantly higher than the others, which explained why it obviously displayed an ER agonistic effect despite its weak ER binding affinity. Taken together, these results uncover that, in addition to the TH disruption effect, CI-PFESAs might also cause estrogenic effects by activating ER pathways.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.9b07708,"Sulfones;Sulfonic Acids;Receptors;Estrogens;Estrogen;Receptors, Estrogen",NA,NA

In this study, PFCs were measured in Rio de Janeiro State in southeast Brazil: in drinking water from various districts in the State, in river water and tucuxi dolphins from the Paraiba do Sul River, several species of fish from the State, and mussels from Guanabara Bay. Liver, kidney, and muscle from fishes were analyzed to enable an understanding of the tissue distribution of PFCs. PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS were detected in all drinking water samples in concentration ranges of 0.58-6.70, 0.35-2.82, and 0.15-1.00 ng L-1, respectively. The profiles of PFCs in drinking water from Brazil (with PFOS concentrations comparable to or higher than those of PFOA) were different from the profiles that have been reported for other countries. In fish, concentrations of PFOS were, in general, higher in liver than in muscle. Concentrations of PFOA in livers of fish were similar to or lower than fish muscle tissue concentrations. PFOS and PFOA were found in brown mussels from Guanabara Bay. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of PFOA calculated for mussels were higher than the BCFs calculated for fishes. Elevated concentrations of PFUnDA (mean: 109 ± 17.4 ng g-1 wet weight) were found in mussels from certain locations within Guanabara Bay. Although PFCs were detected in all types of samples analyzed, the concentrations were generally lower than the concentrations reported for Japan and the USA. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, biota soil accumulation factors (BSAFs) were assessed in earthworms (Eisenia fetida) exposed to soil microcosms amended with zwitterionic fluorotelomers and anionic perfluoroalkyl acids. The 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaine (6:2 FTAB) bioaccumulated in earthworms [BSAF ∼2.5-5.4 (gdw,worm/gdw,soil)-1] but to a lesser extent than perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS: BSAF ∼21-29). The BSAF of perfluorocarboxylates increased from ∼2.0 for C4-C6 analogues to ∼92 for perfluorotridecanoate (C13). In earthworms exposed to Ansulite and Arctic Foam aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs), the BSAF was related to perfluorinated chain length for n:3 fluorotelomer betaines (FtBs), n:1:2 FtB, and n:2 FTAB. Earthworms were also collected in situ from a fire-equipment testing site at a major Canadian airport. Summed PFAS concentrations were between 65,000 and 830,000 ng g-1 wet weight, possibly the highest burden recorded in terrestrial biota. Fluorotelomer sulfonates (6:2 FTS, 8:2 FTS, and 10:2 FTS) and FtB were particularly prevalent. Field worms also displayed elevated concentrations of n:3 acids (n = 3-11), but not those from laboratory microcosms exposed to fluorotelomer-based AFFFs. The findings provide an important confirmation to recent data suggesting that fluorotelomer compounds may accumulate in invertebrate species with limited metabolization.

Waxing results in exposures to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and particulate matter, which have been associated with adverse health effects among professional wax technicians in Scandinavia. However, little is known about exposure among people who participate at other levels of sport, including recreationally, in other regions. Objective: We sought to characterize wax-related exposures among US skiers and snowboarders who participate across numerous levels of sport to expand scientific understanding of environmental health risks among this population. Methods: We used an anonymous electronic survey to evaluate wax-related exposures among US cross-country and downhill skiers and snowboarders. Specifically, we assessed (Fang et al., 2020): duration of time involved with each sport in any role (Freberg et al., 2013), intensity of wax-related exposures based on time spent in waxing areas, wax use, and wax type (Rogowski et al., 2007), frequency of fluorinated wax application, and (Freberg et al., 2010) use of exposure interventions. Results: Participants tended to be long-term winter sports enthusiasts (e.g., median downhill skiing duration: 31 years). Nearly all (92%) participants personally applied some wax to their skis/snowboards and most applied waxes containing PFAS (67%) and solvents (62%). Ski professionals waxed the most pairs of skis with fluorinated waxes annually (median (IQR): 20 (1, 100)), though individuals participating recreationally also applied fluorinated waxes regularly. Exposure interventions were not widely used. Significance: Waxing activities may pose significant risk of exposure to PFAS and other environmental contaminants among the US ski and snowboard community. Efforts are needed to reduce these exposures through changes to wax use patterns and broader adoption of exposure reduction strategies. © 2022 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114335,Fluorocarbons;Humans;Article;United States;Solvents;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;adult;risk assessment;human;major clinical study;environmental health;health hazard;solvent;fluorination;atmospheric pollution;human experiment;Scandinavia;Particulate Matter;particulate matter;Per-;reduction;polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS);ecosystem health;Ski wax;skiing;Skiing;wax;Waxes;Environmental health exposure;Personal protective equipment (PPE);Snowboard wax;ventilation;Ventilation,NA,NA

The present study compared the pharmacokinetic properties of PFNA in two laboratory rodent species. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single dose of PFNA by oral gavage at 1, 3, or 10. mg/kg, and blood was collected from the tail vein at 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 16, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 50 days after treatment. In addition, livers and kidneys were collected for PFNA analysis at the terminal time point. CD-1 mice were given a single oral dose of PFNA of 1 or 10. mg/kg, and 4 males and 4 females were killed at similar time intervals; trunk blood, liver and kidney were collected. Serum and tissue concentrations of PFNA were determined by LC-MS/MS. Serum elimination of PFNA is by and large linear with exposure doses in the rat; however, like PFOA, a major sex difference in the rate of elimination is observed, with an estimated half-life of 30.6 days for males and 1.4 days for females. PFNA is stored preferentially in the liver but not in the kidneys. In the mouse, the rates of PFNA serum elimination are non-linear with exposure dose and are slightly faster in females than males, with terminal estimated serum half-life of 25.8-68.4 days and 34.3-68.9 days, respectively. PFNA is also stored preferentially in the mouse liver but not in the kidneys. Hepatic uptake appears to be more efficient and storage capacity greater in male mice than in females. These data suggest that (1) PFNA is more persistent in the mouse than in the rat; (2) there is a major sex difference in the serum elimination of PFNA in the rat, but much less so in the mouse; and (3) there is a significantly higher hepatic accumulation of PFNA in male mice than in females. © 2011.",NA,10.1016/j.tox.2011.01.003,Female;Animals;Liver;Fatty Acids;Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry;Hydrocarbons;Mice;Rats;Rodentia;Kidney;female;male;Male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;sex difference;animal tissue;mouse;liquid chromatography;liver;mass spectrometry;article;blood sampling;kidney;priority journal;perfluorononanoic acid;rat;drug blood level;Half-Life;Rat;Rattus;Mus;Pharmacokinetics;Mouse;Sex Factors;drug elimination;Sprague-Dawley;Fluorinated;Perfluorononanoic acid;tail;drug half life;Administration;Oral,NA,NA

PCB concentrations in eggs increased with later hatch date, independent of lipid content which also increased over time. Some females may remobilize and transfer more PCBs to their eggs, by delaying migration several weeks, relying on more polluted and stored resources, or being in poor body condition when arriving at the breeding grounds.

Contaminants may impair the humoral immunity and also influence the antioxidant enzyme activity (i.e. oxidative stress). Moreover, physical conditions and oxidative stress during development may reduce telomere lengths, one of the main mechanisms explaining cell senescence. To examine the potential effects of environmental contaminants on physiological biomarkers of health, OHCs with different 'physicochemical' properties were related to immunoglobulin Y levels (IgY; humoral immunity), superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activity in blood plasma, and telomere length (measured in red blood cells) in individual 7-8 weeks old nestlings (n = 35) of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in the Norwegian Sub-Arctic. Different organochlorines (OCs) and perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) were measured in blood plasma of nestlings, demonstrating higher concentrations of the emerging contaminants (PFASs), notably perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compared to legacy OCs. There were no relationships between the contaminant loads and plasma IgY levels. Moreover, differences between years were found for telomere lengths, but this was not related to contaminants and more likely a result of different developmental conditions. However, there were significant and negative relationships between the OC loadings and the SOD activity.

In the present study, we showed that PFOS may trigger neuronal apoptosis through a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-related mechanism. We revealed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was robustly activated in PFOS-exposed neuronal cells. The doses of PFOS that initiates JNK activation coincides with that inducing neuronal apoptosis, as confirmed by western blot and Annexin V-PE/7-AAD analyses. In addition, we found that reactive oxidative species (ROS) accumulation plays a casual role in PFOS-initiated JNK activation, as treatment with ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) abrogated PFOS-induced mitochondrial and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK). In keeping with this notion, the expression of JNK downstream pro-apoptotic target Bim was increased following PFOS exposure in JNK- and ROS-dependent manners. Finally, Annexin V-PE/7-AAD analysis uncovered that treatment with NAC or SP600125 could significantly impair PFOS-induced neuronal apoptosis.

To elucidate spatial distribution and multimedia partitioning of legacy and emerging PFASs in a lotic river flowing into an estuary, PFASs were synchronously analyzed in water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), sediment, and biota samples collected along Guangzhou reach of the Pearl River, South China. Geographically, the concentrations of PFASs in the water phase showed a decreasing trend from the upper and middle sections (urban area) to the down section (suburban area close to estuary) of the river. While perfluorooctanoic acid predominated in water and SPM, more diverse compositions were observed in sediment and biota with the increase in contributions of long-chain PFASs. Field-derived sediment-water partitioning coefficients (Kd) and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of PFASs increased with the increase in perfluorinated carbons. Besides hydrophobicity, water pH and salinity significantly affected the multimedia partitioning of PFASs in a lotic ecosystem. In addition, 87 homologues (63 classes) were identified as emerging PFASs in four media using suspect analysis.

However, further investigations are needed in terms of the human health risk assessment. This study examined the effects of emerging and legacy PFAS exposure on newborn thyroid homeostasis and compared the thyroid disruption caused by 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS using a benchmark dose approach. The health effects of mixture and individual exposure were estimated using the partial least-squares (PLS) model and linear regression, respectively. A Bayesian benchmark dose (BMD) analysis determined the BMD value for adverse effect comparison between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS. The median (interquartile range) concentrations of 6:2 Cl-PFESA (0.573 [0.351-0.872] ng/mL), PFOS (0.674 [0.462-1.007] ng/mL), and PFOA (1.457 [1.034, 2.405] ng/mL) were found to be similar. The PLS model ranked the PFAS variables’ importance in projection (VIP) scores as follows: 6:2 Cl-PFESA > PFOS > PFOA. Linear regression showed that 6:2 Cl-PFESA had a positive association with free triiodothyronine (FT3, P = 0.006) and triiodothyronine (T3, P = 0.014), while PFOS had a marginally significant positive association with FT3 alone (P = 0.042).

Here, we tested a matrix-correction methodology for determining the bioaccumulation potential of emerging PFASs based on peak area in crucian carp from Xiaoqing river, China. Fortification experiments of emerging PFASs extracted from surface water and sediment samples demonstrated that the quantification bias in fish tissues was <34% for analytes detected in fish and water. Tissue distribution ratios (TBRs) and whole-body bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were subsequently calculated by correcting for analyte- and tissue-specific matrix effects. A model evaluation set including seven reference PFASs demonstrated that peak area-based TBRs and BAFs were strongly correlated with those calculated from quantified concentrations (p < 0.05, adjusted r2 > 0.91, slope: 0.99-1.34). Among the detected substances, the trimer acid of hexafluoropropylene oxide and C9 monoether per- and polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acid (PFECA) were identified as bioaccumulative substances. C8 PFECA and C8 monochlorine-substituted perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid displayed similar BAFs value compared to perfluorooctanoic acid. Overall, the proposed methodology provides a rapid hazard screening tool that could be used to assess emerging contaminants without access to authentic standards. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.9b04906,Biochemistry;Fish;Fluorocarbons;Rivers;Surface waters;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Bioaccumulation;China;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;bioaccumulation;environmental monitoring;animal tissue;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Mass spectrometry;chemical compound;fish;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;matrix;tandem mass spectrometry;Tissue;Hexafluoropropylene oxide;carboxylic acid;polyfluoroalkyl substance;tissue distribution;sediment;river;Carboxylic acids;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids;High resolution mass spectrometry;Organic polymers;Shandong;tissue specificity;surface water;Water Pollutants;hydrogen;Chemical;Bioaccumulation factor;Xiaoqing River;Hazards;Carassius;Bioaccumulation potential;correction;Quantitative evaluation,NA,NA

Preparation of samples for FC determination required only nonvolumetric dilution in water, followed by filtration. Determination of TC in whey-based samples required a common saponification procedure, which hydrolyzed the acylcarnitines to FC. L-Carnitine standards were prepared in water at 3 concentrations (7.5, 30, and 60 ng/mL). L-Carnitine-d(3) was incorporated in the sample and standard preparations as a stable isotope internal standard (ISTD), which helped to normalize signal suppression due to fouling of the ionization source, or matrix effects. A short C8 column (50 x 2.1 mm id) was used for liquid chromatography, with mobile phases consisting of 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid in water and methanol. L-Carnitine and the ISTD eluted at about 2 min, and the injection-to-injection cycle time was about 11 min. Multiple-reaction monitoring was used for quantitation by monitoring the ion transitions m/z 162 > 103 and 162 > 85 for L-carnitine, and m/z 165 > 103 and 165 > 85 for the ISTD.

The degradation of fluorotelomer precursors to perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and their uptake spectra corresponded to those of fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) in terms of the number of perfluorinated carbon atoms. Short-chain PFCAs were translocated into the shoots (in descending order perfluoropentanoic, perfluorobutanoic, and perfluorohexanoic acid), whereas long-chain PFCAs mainly remained in the soil. In particular, fluorotelomer phosphate diesters (diPAPs) were retained in the soil and showed the highest degradation potential including evidence of alpha-oxidative processes.

To date, general technologies used to study hydraulic flow patterns of CWs mainly include tracer method, model simulation and velocity measurement, which are either expensive, empirical, or having secondary pollution. In this study, a new technology, which was based on the isotopic composition variation in CWs, was applied to detect the hydraulic flow patterns of two different CWs. Results showed that the hydraulic flow patterns of the two studied wetlands could be detected effectively by using hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. Furthermore, the locations of stagnant areas (SAS) and preferential flow areas (PFAs) were also determined. Significant regional difference in isotopic composition existed inside each CW, and two wetland design suggestions are proposed after hydraulic analysis. One is that the influent of CWs is supposed to be distributed uniformly, and another piece of advice is that the vegetation in the direction perpendicular to water flow should be maintained at the same types and density.

The 29 metabolites identified as important in the differentiation of the two subpopulations after partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) included phosphatidylcholines (PCs), acylcarnitines (ACs; involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids), and the fatty acid (FA) arachidonic acid (ARA). Perfluorinated alkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) and some highly chlorinated orthopolychlorinated biphenyl congeners were greater in the SHB bears and were consistently inversely correlated with discriminating ACs and PCs between the subpopulations.

ARA is an important, conditionally essential, dietary n-6 FA and is also part of the inflammation response, and elevated concentrations in the SHB could be related to differences in chronic contaminant exposure and/or differences in diet and/or season, among a number of possible explanations. Dietary tracers (stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen) were correlated with some discriminatory metabolites, supporting the hypothesis that dietary variation was also an important factor in the differentiation of the subpopulations.

However, these outcomes are biologically related, and we evaluate their joint association with exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances. Methods: We recruited 501 couples from Michigan and Texas in 2005-2009 upon their discontinuing contraception and followed them until pregnancy or 12 months of trying. Female partners provided a serum sample on enrollment and completed daily journals on menstruation, intercourse, and pregnancy test results. We measured seven perfluoroalkyl substances in serum using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We assessed the association between perfluoroalkyl substances and menstrual cycle length using accelerated failure time models and between perfluoroalkyl substances and fecundity using a Bayesian joint modeling approach to incorporate cycle length. Results: Menstrual cycles were 3% longer comparing women in the second versus first tertile of perfluorodecanoate (PFDeA; acceleration factor [AF] = 1.03, 95% credible interval [CrI] = [1.00, 1.05]), but 2% shorter for women in the highest versus lowest tertile of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; AF = 0.98, 95% CrI = [0.96, 1.00]). When accounting for cycle length, relevant covariates, and remaining perfluoroalkyl substances, the probability of pregnancy was lower for women in second versus first tertile of perfluorononanoate (PFNA; odds ratio [OR] = 0.6, 95% CrI = [0.4, 1.0]) although not when comparing the highest versus lowest (OR = 0.7, 95% CrI = [0.3, 1.1]) tertile. Conclusions: In this prospective cohort study, we observed associations between two perfluoroalkyl substances and menstrual cycle length changes, and between select perfluoroalkyl substances and diminished fecundity at some (but not all) concentrations.

We measured PFAS concentrations in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at 5 locations across North Carolina over a 1 year period in 2019. Thirty-four PFASs, including perfluoroalkyl carboxylic, perfluoroalkane sulfonic, perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic and sulfonic acids were analyzed by UHPLC/ESI-MS/MS. Quarterly averaged concentrations ranged from <0.004-14.1 pg m-3. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) ranged from <0.18 to 14.1 pg m-3, comparable to previous PM2.5 measurements from Canada and Europe (<0.02-3.5 pg m-3). Concentrations above 1 pg m-3 were observed in July-September at Charlotte (14.1 pg m-3, PFOA), Wilmington (4.75 pg m-3, PFOS), and Research Triangle Park (1.37 pg m-3, PFOS). Notably, PM2.5 has a short atmospheric lifetime (<2 weeks), and thus, the presence of PFOS in these samples raises questions about their sources, since PFOS production was phased out in the US ∼20 years ago.

Of 21 parameters assessed, significantly more differed between Great Lakes colonies and reference colonies than between the two reference colonies. Relative adrenal, kidney, and liver masses of gulls from some Great Lakes colonies were reduced and thyroid masses increased relative to gulls from reference colonies. Foci of cellular atypia were observed in the hepatocytes of two Great Lakes gulls. Chronic periportal hepatitis, lipogranulomas and vacuolation of hepatocytes, and chronic granulomatous interstitial nephritis were more prevalent or severe in gulls from Great Lakes colonies and were associated with contaminants. The kidneys of gulls from the three most contaminated locations were damaged and functionally compromised. Interstitial nephritis was likely the most functionally significant histopathological lesion. Portal-tract fibrosis, granulomatous hepatitis, and kidney tubule dilation/obstruction and splenic enlargement were more prevalent or severe at reference sites and were associated with blood-borne parasites. Amyloid deposits were observed in the spleen, kidneys, or liver of nearly half of the gulls. Associations between the prevalence or severity of lesions and contaminant levels in gull tissues or the trophic level of their diet suggest some lesions are toxicopathic. Associations were most frequently found with planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and lead. The stress response, as measured by the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, was attenuated in gulls from Areas of Concern and associated with decreased adrenal mass.

Little is known, however, about the extent of the transfer of the different PFAS compounds to the eggs, especially for alternative fluorinated compounds. In the present study, we measured legacy and emerging PFAS, including Gen-X, ADONA, and F-53B, in the plasma of prelaying black-legged kittiwake females breeding in Svalbard and the yolk of their eggs. We aimed to (1) describe the contaminant levels and patterns in both females and eggs, and (2) investigate the maternal transfer, that is, biological variables and the relationship between the females and their eggs for each compound. Contamination of both females and eggs were dominated by linPFOS then PFUnA or PFTriA. We notably found 7:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid─a precursor of long-chain carboxylates─in 84% of the egg yolks, and provide the first documented finding of ADONA in wildlife. Emerging compounds were all below the detection limit in female plasma. There was a linear association between females and eggs for most of the PFAS. Analyses of maternal transfer ratios in females and eggs suggest that the transfer is increasing with PFAS carbon chain length, therefore the longest chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) were preferentially transferred to the eggs. The mean ∑PFAS in the second-laid eggs was 73% of that in the first-laid eggs. Additional effort on assessing the outcome of maternal transfers on avian development physiology is essential, especially for PFCAs and emerging fluorinated compounds which are under-represented in experimental studies. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/acs.est.1c03773,"PFAS;Eggs;Female;Fluorocarbons;black-legged kittiwake;emerging contaminants;Rissa tridactyla;Svalbard;top predator;Top predator;Birds;Black-legged kittiwake;Animals;Carboxylation;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Carboxylic Acids;animal;Arctic;Arctic Regions;Charadriiformes;female;fluorocarbon;bird;environmental monitoring;egg;Emerging contaminant;Contamination;carboxylic acid;Maternal transfer;Carboxylic acids;Fluorinated compound;Laid eggs;Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids;RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Ovum",NA,NA

Ingestion is a vital pathway for PFASs to transmit to humans especially through water and fish. In present study, PFASs in water and fish from the drinking water source of Beijing in China were investigated. Three layers of water were collected in order to find the connection between concentrations of PFASs and depth of water, which showed no prominent correlation. PFASs in water from Miyun Reservoir with concentrations of 5.30–8.50 ng/L, were relatively lower compared with other reports on raw drinking water. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were the dominant PFASs. In addition, six species of fish (including Cyprinus carpio, Carassius auratus, Erythroculter dabryi, Pseudohemiculter dispar, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Siniperca chuatsi) were analyzed, with concentrations of PFASs ranging from 1.70 to 14.32 ng/g wet weight (w.w.). Due to relatively stronger bioaccumulation potential, long chain perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) and perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs) were detected with higher concentrations, especially perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of PFASs through drinking water and fish consumption were 0.20–0.34 and 3.44–12.61 ng/kg bw/day based on Exposure Factors Handbook of Chinese Population, respectively. In addition, the EDI of high-priority concern PFASs via pork, chicken and dust were also calculated, with value of 0.015–0.043, 0.003–0.013 and 0.074–0.390 ng/kg bw/day, respectively.

However, exposure to pollutants that induce metabolic disorders in wildlife as a cause of adverse effects is unknown. In this study, approximately 3108 compounds, including 11 groups of metabolites and 388 pollutants, were simultaneously identified in the blood of wild crucian carp (Carassius auratus) captured in three bays of Taihu Lake, China. A visualized network linking thousands of co-regulated metabolites was automatically produced for the screened signals. This comprehensive view of the differences in blood metabolite profiles in carp from the north and south bays showed that triglycerides (TGs) were the intrinsic molecules most affected by differing environmental pollution in each bay. The regional differences in metabolite profiles were linked to exposure to screened perfluorinated compounds that displayed corresponding regional differences in concentrations and effects on TGs in in vivo exposure tests. Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) was the key pollutant responsible for the variation in blood TGs in wild crucian carp, and exposure to PFUnDA resulted in extremely high biological activity on lipid deposition in the liver tissues of crucian carp at environmental levels.

Significantly higher concentrations of PFAAs have been found in sewage plant and industrial areas. The concentration of PFAAs in the Xupu water source area (XPS) was slightly higher than that in other water source areas of the Yangtze River, which were either not affected or were less affected by the fluorine industry. The log KD-SPM (distribution coefficient between SPM and water), log KD-SED (distribution coefficient between sediment and water), and log KOC-SED (the organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient) of PFAAs showed significant differences between the wet season and dry season, which may also be affected by carbon chain length. Source identification results showed that industries, wastewater discharge, and nonpoint sources were the main sources of PFAAs in this region.

Several factors including surface charges, size, exposure dose, and exposure time affect the biological effects of NPs. Surface-charged NPs have a more significant impact on the normal physiological activities of cells, while smaller particles facilitate the penetration across the cell membranes. Higher doses and longer exposure time contribute to the higher accumulation. In addition, additives and environmental pollutants attached to NPs pose a greater threat to organisms than NPs themselves. There are still several analytical challenges in the study of the biological effects of NPs, especially their accumulation, degradation, migration and interactions with the biological systems.

They are found in brains of wildlife; however, little is known about effects on the developing brain. To determine the effects of PFAS on brain and cardiac innervation, we conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment with Northern leopard frog larvae (Rana pipiens) exposed to control, 10 ppb perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), or a PFAS mixture totaling 10 ppb that mimicked aqueous film forming foam-impacted surface water (4 ppb PFOS, 3 ppb perfluorohexane sulfonate, 1.25 ppb perfluorooctanoate, 1.25 ppb perfluorohexanoate, and 0.5 ppb perfluoro-n-pentanoate). Water was spiked with PFAS and 25 larvae (Gosner stage (GS) 25) added to each mesocosm (n = 4 mesocosms per treatment). After 30 days, we harvested eight brains per mesocosm and remaining larvae developed to GS 46 (i.e. metamorphosis) before brains and hearts were collected. Weight, length, GS, and time to metamorphosis were recorded. Brain concentrations of all five PFAS were quantified using LC/MS/MS. Dopamine and metabolites, serotonin and its metabolite, norepinephrine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate were quantified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography with electrochemical detection while acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase activity were quantified with the Invitrogen Amplex Red Acetylcholine Assay. PFOS accumulated in the brain time- and dose-dependently. After 30 days, the mixture decreased serotonin while both PFAS treatments decreased glutamate. Interestingly, acetylcholine increased in PFAS treatments at GS 46. This research shows that developmental environmentally relevant exposure to PFAS changes neurotransmitters, especially acetylcholine. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.ntt.2020.106907,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Article;Brain;Environmental Exposure;animal;environmental exposure;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;animal tissue;perfluoro compound;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;high performance liquid chromatography;perflexane;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;brain;drug effect;developmental toxicity;polyfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;metabolism;neurotoxicity;Neurotoxicity;synaptic transmission;octanoic acid;spike;glutamic acid;length;aqueous solution;Caprylates;physiology;metabolite;4 aminobutyric acid;surface water;Water Pollutants;acetylcholine;brain development;weight;serotonin;Serotonin;Chemical;Rana pipiens;Synaptic Transmission;larva;Larva;Per-;polyfluoroalkyl substances;per;metamorphosis;dopamine;acetylcholinesterase;Acetylcholine;electrochemical detection;Glutamate;heart innervation;mesocosm;neurotransmission;noradrenalin;perfluoro n pentanoate,NA,NA

In aquatic environment, DDTs and PCBs, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury are ubiquitous contaminants, persistent and bioaccumulative. The main aim of this Ph.D. study is to highlight the dynamics of redistribution of these selected chemicals with different physico-chemical properties in trophic webs of four major Italian southern alpine deep lakes (Lake Maggiore, Lake Como, Lake Iseo, Lake Garda) and a smaller one (Lake Mergozzo). Specifically, stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen and trophic magnification factor were used, respectively, for the description of the trophic interactions to elucidate chemicals behaviour in biota and to model the biomagnification in food web. In conclusion, notwithstanding the normative restrictions, DDTs, PCBs, PFOS and Hg still reached quantifiable concentrations in biota of the studied lakes. The analysis of trophic webs revealed that feeding relationships are not fixed and stable over time but they are probably ruled by the availability of resources. DDTs, PCBs and Hg biomagnify, as described in literature, confirming that sampling and analysis were correct; on the contrary, biomagnification for PFOS was not well characterised and further studies should be carried out.

Of the approximately 10,000 known PFAS, only a few have undergone comprehensive testing, resulting in limited experimental data. In this study, we employed a combination of physics-based methods and data-driven models to address gaps in PFAS bioaccumulation potential. Using the COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Realistic Solvents (COSMO-RS) method, we predicted n-octanol/water partition coefficients (logKOW), crucial for PFAS bioaccumulation. Our developed Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) model exhibited high accuracy (R2 = 0.95, RMSEC = 0.75) and strong predictive ability (Q2LOO = 0.93, RMSECV = 0.83). Leveraging the extensive NORMAN, we predicted logKOW for over 4,000 compounds, identifying 244 outliers out of 4519. Further categorizing the database into eight Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) categories, we confirmed fluorine atoms role in enhanced bioaccumulation. Utilizing predicted logKOW, water solubility logSW, and vapor pressure logVP values, we calculated additional physicochemical properties that are responsible for the transport and dispersion of PFAS in the environment. Parameters such as Henry's Law (kH), air–water partition coefficient (KAW), octanol–air coefficient (KOA), and soil adsorption coefficient (KOC) exhibited favorable correlations with literature data (R2 > 0.66).

The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated, and the human exposures of PFAAs via consumption of the vegetables for different age groups assuming the maximum levels detected in each vegetable and average consumption rates were also estimated. The Sigma PFAA levels ranged from 1.67 to 33.5 ng/g dry weight (dw) in the edible parts of all the vegetables, with perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) being the dominant compound with an average contribution of 49% to the Sigma PFAA level. The leafy vegetables showed higher Sigma PFAA levels (average 8.76 ng/g dw) than the fruit and root vegetables. For all the vegetables, the log io BAF values of perfluorinated carboxylic acids showed a decreasing trend with increasing chain length, with PFBA having the highest log in BAF values (average 0.98). Cabbage had higher bioaccumulation of PFBA (log(10) BAF 1.24) than other vegetables. For the greenhouse soils and vegetables, the average contribution of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to Sigma PFAA was lower than that in the open field samples, while the contributions of PFBA, PFHxA, PFPeA to Sigma PFAA were higher. Irrigation water may be an important source of PFAAs in greenhouse, while for open field vegetables and soils, atmospheric deposition may be an additional contamination pathway.

A lipophilic nature of this emerging class of organic pollutants has been hypothesized as an origin of their bioaccumulation and toxicity. Both carboxylate and sulfonate, however, are considered hydrophilic while perfluroalkyl groups are not only hydrophobic but also oleophobic. Partition coefficients of a homologous series of perfluoroalkyl and alkyl carboxylates between water and n-octanol were determined as a measure of their lipophilicity by ion-transfer cyclic voltammetry. Very similar lipophilicity of perfluoroalkyl and alkyl chains with the same length is demonstrated experimentally for the first time by fragment analysis of the partition coefficients. This finding is important for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications of perfluoroalkyl compounds. Interestingly, ∼2 orders of magnitude higher lipophilicity of a perfluoroalkyl carboxylate or sulfonate in comparison to its alkyl counterpart is ascribed nearly exclusively to their oxoanion groups. The higher lipophilicity originates from a strong electron-withdrawing effect of the perfluoroalkyl group on the adjacent oxoanion group, which is weakly hydrated to decrease its hydrophilicity. In fact, the inductive effect is dramatically reduced for a fluorotelomer with an ethylene spacer between perfluorohexyl and carboxylate groups, which is only as lipophilic as its alkyl counterpart, nonanoate, and is 400 times less lipophilic than perfluorononanoate. The high lipophilicity of perfluoroalkyl carboxylate and sulfonate implies that their permeation across such a thin lipophilic membrane as a bilayer lipid membrane is limited by their transfer at a membrane/water interface. The limiting permeability is lower and less dependent on their lipophilicity than the permeability controlled by their diffusion in the membrane interior as assumed in the classical solubility-diffusion model. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/ja807961s,Biochemistry;Fluorocarbons;Carboxylation;Carboxylic Acids;Surface-Active Agents;fluorocarbon;controlled study;Organic pollutants;alkyl group;chemistry;perfluoro compound;alkanesulfonic acid;surfactant;sulfonic acid derivative;water;article;carboxylic acid;carboxylic acid derivative;lipophilicity;hydrophilicity;chemical phenomena;Ethylene;Hydrophilicity;Drug products;Orders of magnitude;Water;solubility;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative;partition coefficient;octanol;ion transport;lipid membrane;Alkanesulfonates;Thermodynamics;Cell membranes;Capillarity;chemical model;anion;Hydrates;Chemical;Models;diffusion;Hydrophilic Interactions;Hydrophobic;1-Octanol;N-octanol;thermodynamics;Partition coefficient;Homologous series;electrolyte;Electrolytes;Cyclic voltammetry;nonanoic acid;membrane permeability;permeability;Permeability;Alkylation;Alkyl chain;Bilayer lipid membrane;bilayer membrane;Biomedical applications;Carboxylate groups;cyclic potentiometry;Diffusion model;Electron-withdrawing effects;Inductive effects;lipid bilayer;Lipid Bilayers;Lipophilic membrane;Lipophilicity;Membrane permeability;Perfluroalkyl;Sulfones,NA,NA

In addition, potential factors influencing factor of PFAS bioaccumulation in fish and invertebrates such as age, sex, and habitat, were investigated. ƩPFAS concentrations were in the range of 2.3- 6.1 ng/g-d.w (mean = 3.9 ± 1.9) in studied species which are equal to 0.46-1.2 ng/g-w.w according to their conversion factor. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was the most abundant perfluorinated compound in studied organisms and tissues. The results of correlation analysis showed that the bioaccumulation of PFAS in aquatic organisms is significantly correlated to the length of the compound's carbon chain, the identity of anionic group, and organism's age, sex, and habitant. The risk assessment using hazard index calculation and Monte-Carlo simulation indicated that weekly consumption of prawn and fish fillets does not pose a health risk to adults but might threaten children's health. However, the risk posed by PFAS exposure via entire fish or fish liver intake is an important issue for wild marine mammals (i.e., dolphins).

It highlights human population-based associations as well as in vitro-based experimental data to inform an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these health effects. Among the mechanisms by which PFAS may induce toxicity is via their interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors that regulate lipid metabolism and placental functions important to healthy pregnancies, as well as fetal and child development. Recent Findings In utero exposure to prevalent environmental contaminants such as PFAS is associated with negative health outcomes during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and later in life. Specifically, PFAS have been associated with increased incidence of gestational diabetes, childhood obesity, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. In terms of placental molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, studies demonstrate that PFAS interfere with trophoblast lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and invasion. Moreover these effects could be mediated in part by the interaction between PFAS and PPARs, as well as other biological mechanisms.

A stabilization strategy using a cocktail of N-ethylmaleimide and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was developed and applied to stabilize both analytes in human blood during sample collection, processing, and storage. A rugged and accurate LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the quantitation of BMS-753493 and its active moiety, BMS-748285, in human plasma. The stabilized plasma samples were extracted by protein precipitation. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Luna C8 analytical column with a gradient elution. Analytes and their stable isotope labeled internal standards were detected by positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The standard curves, which ranged from 10.0 to 5000 ng/mL for BMS-753493 and from 1.00 to 500 ng/mL for BMS-748285, were fitted to a 1/x(2) weighted linear regression model.

Samples were extracted by formic acid-acetonitrile solution and cleaned up and fractionated by SPE (WAX). Target PFAS quantification was performed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography interfaced with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). Non-targeted analysis (NTA) PFAS screening was performed with UPLC coupled with a quadrupole-Exactive orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer (UPLC-Q-Exactive-HRMS). An iterative exclusion (IE) approach was applied to data acquisition for NTA suspect screening to increase the potential for unknown PFAS discovery with MS/MS. A complex workflow in Compound Discoverer was set up to automate data processing of the PFAS suspects search. New mass lists and MS/MS databases, which included a large number of PFAS, were set up and introduced into the search for high-throughput structure identification using HRMS techniques. The integrated targeted-NTA method successfully analyzed for legacy and alternative PFAS in model environmental biota samples, namely polar bear liver and bird egg samples.

Because of the dependence of the ivory gull on sea ice and its high trophic position, suggested environmental threats are climate change and contaminants. The present study investigated contaminant levels (organochlorines, brominated flame retardants, perfluorinated alkyl substances, and mercury) in ivory gull eggs from four colonies in the Norwegian (Svalbard) and Russian Arctic (Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya).

In this study, seven genes - except for cytochrome P450 3A (CYP450 3A) - were identified as DEGs that were downregulated in response to 15- and 30 days exposures to PFOA and/or PFOS. Four DEGs (c-type lysozyme, EF-1β, complement component C3-1, and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1) returned to basal levels after 15 days of recovery after 30 days of exposure to the compounds.

Slow desorption of stronger sorbing, zwitterionic, and cationic PFASs may cause extended remediation times and rebound in aqueous PFAS concentrations. Persulfate oxidation has the potential to convert a complex mixture of PFASs into a simpler and more recoverable mixture of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs). AFFF-impacted soils were treated with heat-activated persulfate in batch reactors and subjected to 7-day leaching experiments. Soil and water were analyzed using a combination of targeted and high resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry techniques as well as the total oxidizable precursors assay. Following oxidation, total PFAS composition showed the expected shift to a higher fraction of PFAAs, and this led to higher total PFAS leaching in pretreated reactors (108-110%) vs control reactors (62-90%). In both pretreated and control soils, precursors that remained following leaching experiments were 61-100% cationic and zwitterionic. Results suggest that persulfate pretreatment of soils has promise as an enhanced recovery technique for remediation of total PFASs in impacted soils.

We applied stable isotopes of water and nitrate together with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs: carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, perfluorooctanoic acid and 2,4-dinitrophenol) to evaluate mixing and inputs of water and contaminants from tributaries into the mainstem of the transboundary Danube River. Stable isotope (delta O-18, delta H-2) variations from low values (- 13.3 parts per thousand, - 95.1 parts per thousand) in the Upper Danube after the Inn River confluence to high values (- 9.9 parts per thousand, - 69.7 parts per thousand) at the Danube River mouth revealed snowmelt dominated tributary mixing (- 70%) in the mainstem. Stable isotopes of nitrate (delta N-15-NO3) in the Danube River varied from lower values (+ 6.7 parts per thousand) in the Upper Danube to higher values after the mixing with Morava River (+10.5 parts per thousand) and showed that cold snowmelt can reduce biological activity and controls nitrate biotransformation processes in the mainstem up to 1000 km downstream. Data on emerging contaminants affirmed the low biodegradation potential of organic compounds transferred into the mainstem by tributaries. We found pollutant source tracing in large rivers is complicated by mixing of multiple sources with overlapping isotopic signatures, but additional tracers such as CECs improve the interpretation of hydrological processes (e.g., water transit time) and support tracing of nitrate pollution sources, and biogeochemical processes. Our approach can be applied to other watersheds to improve the understanding of dilution and mixing processes.

In most soils, PFOS sorption isotherms were nonlinear. PFOS sorption distribution coefficients (Kd) ranged from 5 to 229 mL/g (median: 28 mL/g), with 63% of the Fijian soils and 35% of the Australian soils showing Kd values that exceeded the observed median Kd. Multiple linear regression showed that TOC, amorphous aluminum and iron oxides contents, anion exchange capacity, pH, and silt content, jointly explained about 53% of the variance in PFOS Kd in soils. Variable charge soils with net positive surface charges, and moderate to elevated TOC content, generally displayed enhanced PFOS sorption than in temperate or tropical soils with TOC as the only sorbent phase, especially at acidic pH ranges.

At the cellular level, these effects are mainly mediated by interactions with nuclear receptors/transcription factors, leading to the modulation of genes involved in lipid homeostasis, as well as by rapid, receptor-independent pathways. Several potential metabolic disruptors are found in aquatic environments. In fish, different EDs have been shown to affect hepatic lipid homeostasis both in vivo and in vitro. However, little information is available in aquatic invertebrates due to our poor knowledge of the regulatory pathways of lipid metabolism. In this work, primary cell cultures from the digestive gland of the bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis were utilized to investigate the effects of model EDs (bisphenol A (BPA) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS)) on lipid homeostasis. Both compounds (at 24 and 3 h of exposure) increased intracellular lipid and tryglyceride-TAG content, with strongest effects of PFOS at 10− 7 M. Acyl-CoA oxidase activity was unaffected, whereas some changes in the activity of glycolytic, antioxidant/biotransformation enzymes were observed; however, no clear relationship was found with lipid accumulation. Evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential Δψm and determination of extracellular TAG content indicate that PFOS interferes with mitochondrial function and lipid secretion, whereas BPA mainly affects lipid secretion. Experiments with specific inhibitors showed that activation of PI-3 kinase and extracellularly regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK MAPK) plays a key role in mediating lipid accumulation.

As for many other organic substances that are of environmental concern, the diet is the main route of human exposure to PFAS. However, in certain cases drinking water may also mean a significant contribution to human exposure, and to a lesser extent, dust and air (indoor exposure). In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS, their biomagnification in food webs, as well as their potential accumulation and toxicity, have generated a notable interest, which has been evidenced by the considerable number of publications in this regard.

In order to study the combined effect of temperature and UVB increase, on the phytoplankton community in the Saint Lawrence Estuary, duplicates of four different treatments were applied to 2 m(3) mesocosms to simulate an overall 3 degrees C and a 77.8% UVB increase, and combined. Samples were collected every 6 h over 10 days and the phytoplankton community was then analysed using a conventional flow cytometer and a Cytosense flow cytometer. Flow cytometry distinguished 9 clusters (Pico, Nano I, C3, C4, CHAINS, C6, C7 and C8) of cells sharing similar optical properties with average sizes varying from 1.3 mu m up to 101 mu m for chain forming cells. Compared to untreated enclosures, the high UVB treatment induced lower cell abundances (up to -40%) for clusters Pico, Nano I. C4, CHAINS and C7, followed by an unexpected cell abundance increase in all the clusters during the last 3 days of the experiment (up to 46%). This increase was sustained by faster calculated periodicities of the cell optical characteristics and abundances, linked to a shorter cell cycle. In the samples from the high temperature treatment mesocosms, a positive delay was observed for the cell abundance increase in clusters CHAINS, C6 and C8, combined with higher average abundance values (up to 67% with respect to untreated mesocosms). During the last 3 days of the experiment, abundances decreased compared to the values observed in the high UVB mesocosms, with a slower trend in the periodicities, suggesting that high temperature inhibits the cell cycle. The combined temperature and UVB treatment emphasized the effects observed under high temperature treatments, maintaining temperature positive effects (i.e. higher abundances) on clusters C3, CHAINS, C6 and C8 suggesting a compensation from the positive temperature effects over the negative (i.e. lower abundances) UVB effects. Increasing temperature induced a negative effect on the abundance of clusters C4 and C7. In this case, trends in C6 and C8 cell periodicities were faster than under normal conditions while Nano I, C4 and C7 cycles were slower. Cells<3 mu m were negatively affected by the combined exposure (up to -55% compared to untreated mesocosms) while most of the larger cells were positively affected (up to -55% compared to untreated mesocosms), suggesting a shift to an herbivorous food web (sensu Legendre and Rassoulzadegan, 1995). Results suggest that changes in cell cycles due to increases in temperature or UVB exposure may play an important role in controlling abundance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our study presents a broad investigation of both legacy POPs and ECs in non-destructive matrices from a bird of prey. Plasma and feathers were sampled in 2015 and 2016 from 70 whitetailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) nestlings from two archipelagos in Norway. Preen oil was also sampled in 2016. Samples were analysed for POPs (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs)) and ECs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), dechlorane plus (DPs), phosphate and novel brominated flame retardants (PFRs and NBFRs)). A total of nine PCBs, three OCPs, one PBDE and one PFAS were detected in over 50% of the plasma and feather samples within each sampling year and location. Significant and positive correlations were found between plasma, feathers and preen oil concentrations of legacy POPs and confirm the findings of previous research on the usefulness of these matrices for non-destructive monitoring. In contrast, the suitability of feathers for ECs seems to be limited. Detection frequencies (DF) of PFASs were higher in plasma (mean DF: 78%) than in feathers (mean DF: 38%). Only perfluoroundecanoic acid could be quantified in over 50% of both plasma and feather samples, yet their correlation was poor and not significant. The detection frequencies of PFRs, NBFRs and DPs were very low in plasma (mean DF: 1–13%), compared to feathers (mean DF: 10–57%). This may suggest external atmospheric deposition, rapid internal biotransformation or excretion of these compounds. Accordingly, we suggest prioritising plasma for PFASs analyses, while the sources of PFRs, NBFRs and DPs in feathers and plasma need further investigation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.333,PFASs;POPs;Animals;Article;Eagles;Environmental Monitoring;Feathers;Haliaeetus albicilla;Norway;Raptores;Hydrocarbons;Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers;animal;nonhuman;biological monitoring;bird;blood analysis;controlled study;feather;nestling;Organic pollutants;plasma;Plasma;polybrominated diphenyl ether;polychlorinated biphenyl;Preen oil;eagle;environmental monitoring;Environmental Pollutants;persistent organic pollutant;pollutant;chemistry;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Heavy metals;perfluoroundecanoic acid;pollution monitoring;chlorinated hydrocarbon;concentration (composition);flame retardant;Flame retardants;Flame Retardants;matrix;procedures;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;blood level;Emerging contaminant;pesticide;priority journal;chemical analysis;diphenyl ether derivative;Feather;analysis;Dechlorane plus;biotransformation;phosphate;concentration (parameters);atmospheric deposition;circulation;Meteorological problems;PFRs;Persistent organic pollutant;Polybrominated diphenylethers;Chlorinated;Detection frequency;PFR;European Continental Ancestry Group,NA,NA

Although complex near-surface hydrogeology of stream corridors challenges sampling efforts, recent advances in heat tracing of discharge zones enable efficient and informed data collection. For this study, we used a combination of streambed temperature push-probe and thermal infrared methods to guide a discharge-zone-oriented sample collection along approximately 6 km of a coastal trout stream on Cape Cod, MA. Eight surface-water locations and discharging groundwater from 24 streambed and bank seepages were analysed for dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductance, stable water isotopes, and a range of PFAS compounds, which are contaminants of emerging concern in aquatic environments. The results indicate a complex system of groundwater discharge source flowpaths, where the sum of concentrations of six PFAS compounds (corresponding to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule ""UCMR 3"") showed a median concentration of 52 +/- 331 (SD) ng/L with two higher outliers and three discharges with PFAS concentrations below the quantification limit. Higher PFAS concentration was related (-0.66 Spearman rank, p < .001) to discharging groundwater that showed an evaporative signature (deuterium excess), indicating flow through at least one upgradient kettle lake. Therefore, more regional groundwater flowpaths originating from outside the local river corridor tended to show higher PFAS concentrations as evaluated at their respective discharge zones. Conversely, PFAS concentrations were typically low at discharges that did not indicate evaporation and were adjacent to steep hillslopes and, therefore, were classified as locally recharged groundwater. Previous research at this stream found that the native brook trout spawn at discharge points of groundwater recharged on local hillslopes, likely in response to generally higher levels of DO. Our study shows that by targeting high oxygen discharges the trout may thereby be avoiding emerging contaminants such as PFAS in groundwater recharged farther from the stream.",NA,10.1002/hyp.13752,Groundwater;Buffers,NA,NA

Techniques that quantify total organic fluorine (TOF) such as the adsorbable organic fluorine (AOF) and extractable organic fluorine (EOF) methods are important for PFAS risk assessments. The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate each step of the AOF (loading, washing, combustion) and EOF (loading, washing, elution, combustion) methods for the recovery of ten ultrashort-, short-, and long-chain unsubstituted perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs). We measured the overall recovery of fluoride for each method for each PFAA, and the recovery of each PFAA around the loading, washing, and elution steps. We also measured the combustion efficiency of each PFAA by direct combustion. The overall AOF and EOF recovery ranged from 9.3%–103.3% to 21.0%–108.1%, respectively, with higher recoveries measured for PFAAs with increasing chain length in both methods. The three ultrashort-chain PFAAs (trifluoroacetic acid, perfluoropropionic acid, and perfluoropropanesulfonic acid) exhibited the lowest overall recoveries from 9.3–25.2% for AOF and 21.0–51.5% for EOF. We found that decreases in the overall recovery are the result of losses of ultrashort- and short-chain PFAAs during the washing step and the incomplete mineralization of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids during combustion for AOF and incomplete elution of short- and long-chain PFAAs and the loss of ultrashort-chain PFAAs during the washing step for EOF. Our data suggest that the EOF method is more appropriate than the AOF method for measuring TOF in samples containing ultrashort- and short-chain PFAAs and that methodological improvements are possible with a focus on the washing, elution, and combustion steps. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,10.1016/j.watres.2023.120497,PFAS;Fluorocarbons;Article;Sulfonic Acids;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;perfluoroalkanoic acid;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;Risk assessment;sulfonic acid derivative;organofluorine derivative;Recovery;perfluorobutanoic acid;perfluorobutanesulfonic acid;combustion;fluorine;trifluoroacetic acid;Ion chromatography;Fluorine;Water Pollutants;Fluorine compounds;elution;trifluoromethanesulfonic acid;Chemical;fluoride;Combustion ion chromatography;Ultrashort-chain polyfluoroalkyl substance;Extractables;Adsorbable organic fluorine;Adsorbable organic fluorine (AOF);Adsorbable organics;Combustion;Combustion ion chromatography (CIC);Extractable organic fluorine;Extractable organic fluorine (EOF);mineralization;Organic fluorine;perfluoropropanesulfonic acid;perfluoropropionic acid;Total organic fluorine;Total organic fluorine (TOF);Ultrashort-chain PFASs;Washing;water loading (test),NA,NA

This study analyzed 17 PFASs in surface water samples collected from the Wuliangsuhai watershed in the wet and dry seasons, and investigated the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics, potential sources, and ecological risks of PFASs in the study area. PFASs were detected in all surface water samples at concentrations ranging from 4.00 to 263.45 ng•L-1. The spatial distribution of PFASs was affected by local human activities and showed two main types of characteristics. The first type was associated with Yellow River and canal water, which had relatively low concentrations of PFASs and was dominated by perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). The second type was associated with drain and lake water receiving industrial, agricultural, and domestic wastewater from the Hetao irrigation area, which had relatively high levels of PFASs and was dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The PFAS concentrations in water samples collected during the dry season were higher than those collected in the wet season, being affected by the increased production of short-chain PFASs and seasonal changes in the amount of water from the Yellow River. The results of PFOS/PFOA, PFOA/PFNA, and PFHpA/PFOA indicated that the PFASs in the study area originate from atmospheric deposition and point source pollution. The risk assessment results showed that the current risk level from PFOA and PFOS in the study area is relatively low but their long-term cumulative effects cannot be ignored due to the cumulative characteristics and long-distance migration ability of PFASs. © 2021, Science Press.

These compounds have been widely used for the past six decades in a range of industrial and consumer products such as textiles and food packaging materials, respectively, because of their unique properties as repellents of dirt, water and oils. PFAS include thousands of chemicals but many studies have been concentrated mainly on perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSA), such as perfluorooctanesulofonic acid (PFOS), perfluoroalkylsulfonamides (PFASAs) and perfluoroalkylcarboxylic acids (PFCAs), which include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). These compounds are toxic and it has been demonstrated they are persistent in the environment and bioaccumulative in the trophic chain. Although the most abundant PFAS in human samples is PFOS, other PFASAs and PFCAs are also frequently detected. For these reasons, the industrial production of PFOS and some of its derivatives was phased out by the major producer 3M in 2002, and the European Union banned most uses from the summer of 2008. However, hundreds of related chemicals (e.g., homologues with shorter or longer alkyl chains, perfluorooctanoic acid and telomers), which potentially may degrade to PFCAs are not strongly regulated. Human exposure to PFAS, mainly PFOS and PFOA, is due to a variety of environmental and product-related sources, although food and drinking water could be the dominant intake pathway. PFAS can contaminate food by bioaccumulation of especially longer chain members in fish and shellfish (a result of oceans acting as contaminant sinks) or by contact with packaging materials. To date, there have been few systematic investigations on PFAS levels - mostly in North America and Western Europe - and some dietary intakes are being reported according to average consumption data. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is today among the most widely used techniques for the analysis of PFAS in both environmental and food samples, and several modern approaches such as ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) enable the reduction of the analysis time without compromising resolution and separation efficiency, allowing to achieve high-throughput analysis. However, the analysis of these families of compounds is difficult being the possible contamination of samples by lab equipments and instrumentation one of the most important problems. It is very common the release of PFAS (especially PFOA) from LC components, since perfluorinated polymers are often used in the manufacturing of tubing, septa and seals, which makes especially tricky the analysis of perfluorooctanoic acid. In this chapter, the role of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for the analysis of perfluorooctanoic acid, together with other perfluoroalkyl substances, in food samples will be reviewed. Coverage of all kind of applications is beyond the scope of the present contribution, so it will focus on the most relevant applications published in the last years. The occurrence of PFOA in food samples which is necessary to evaluate its daily intake from diet will also be addressed. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",NA,NA,⛔ No DOI found;character(0);Mass Spectrometry;Food,NA,NA

By analysing blood samples from female herring gulls from an urban (Oslofjord) and a rural (Hornøya, Northern Norway) location, with different presumed diets and exposure to contaminants the presence and levels of contaminants in the blood, biomarkers for DNA damage and recovery, as well as biomarkers for general health was quantified. The objectives of this thesis were (1) to compare levels of contaminants in the two herring gull colonies, (2) to clarify whether exposure to contaminants affects the integrity of DNA in white blood cells (WBCs) and (3) to quantify the sensitivity of herring gull WBC DNA to oxidative stress.

This study aimed to clarify the effects and mechanism of PFOA on the AD process as well as the removal pathways of PFOA in an AD system. The results showed that the methane recovery efficiency was inhibited by 7.6–19.7% with the increased PFOA concentration of 0.5–3.0 mg/L, and the specific methanogenesis activity (SMA) was inhibited by 8.6–22.3%. The electron transfer system (ETS) was inhibited by 22.1–37.3% in the PFOA-containing groups. However, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) gradually increased due to the toxicity of PFOA, and the ratio of protein to polysaccharide shows an upward trend, which led to the formation of sludge aggregates and resistance to the toxic of PFOA. The PFOA mass balance analysis indicated that 64.2–71.6% of PFOA was removed in the AD system, and sludge adsorption was the main removal pathway, accounting for 36.1–61.2% of the removed PFOA. In addition, the anaerobes are proposed to have the potential to reduce PFOA through biochemical degradation since 10.4–28.2% of PFOA was missing in the AD system. This study provides a significant reference for the treatment of high-strength PFOA-containing wastes. © 2022 by the authors.",NA,10.3390/w14142255,Perfluorooctanoic acid;Metabolism;anaerobic digestion;Anaerobic digestion;Biodegradation;anaerobic digestion (AD);Anerobic digestion;Electron transfer;Electron transfer system;electron transfer system (ETS);Electron transitions;Methanogenesis;perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA);Perfluorooctanoic acid removal pathway;PFOA removal pathways;Sludge digestion;Specific methanogenesis activity;specific methanogenesis activity (SMA);Transfer systems;Gastrointestinal Agents,NA,NA

PFASs are suspected of disrupting thyroid hormone homeostasis in humans. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between serum PFASs and thyroid function in a remote population of Alaska Natives. Serum samples were collected from 85 individuals from St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. The concentrations of 13 PFASs, as well as free and total thyroxine (T4), free and total triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotropin (TSH) were quantified in serum samples. The relationships between circulating concentrations of PFASs and thyroid hormones were assessed using multiple linear regression fit with generalized estimating equations. Several PFASs, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), were positively associated with TSH concentrations when modeled individually. PFOS and PFNA were significantly associated with free T3 and PFNA was significantly associated with total T3 in models with PFAS*sex interactive terms; these associations suggested negative associations in men and positive associations in women. PFASs were not significantly associated with concentrations of free or total T4. Serum PFASs are associated with circulating thyroid hormone concentrations in a remote population of Alaska Natives.

Frogs from cities with large-scale fluorochemical industries had significantly greater liver ςPFAS levels (mean 54.28 ng/g in Changshu; 31.22 ng/g in Huantai) than those from cities without similar industry (9.91 ng/g in Zhoushan; 7.68 ng/g in Quzhou). Females had significantly lower liver PFAS levels than males, and older frogs tended to have lower PFAS levels than younger frogs. Skin, liver, and muscle contributed nearly 80% to the whole body burden of 6:2 Cl-PFESA in males, whereas the female ovary alone accounted for 58.4%. These results suggest substantial maternal transfer of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to eggs, raising concern regarding its developmental toxicity on frogs and other species. The bioaccumulation factor results (6:2 Cl-PFESA > PFOS; HFPO-TA > PFOA) suggest a stronger accumulative potential in the black-spotted frog for these alternative substances compared to their predecessors.

It is not well-investigated in the veterinary world and food chains. In the current study, antibiotic susceptibility profiles of 24 K. pneumoniae strains isolated from powdered milk samples produced in Germany were investigated by a microdilution test. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was applied to identify genomic determinants for antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence-associated genes and plasmids replicons. All isolates were susceptible to the majority (14/18) of tested antibiotics. Resistance to colistin, fosfomycin, chloramphenicol and piperacillin was found. The ambler class A ss-lactamase, bla(SHV) variants were identified in all isolates, of which bla(SHV-187) was most prevalent and found in 50% of isolates. Single-nucleotide-variants of oqxA and oqxB conferring resistance to phenicol/quinolone were found in all isolates, and the oqxB17 was the most prevalent found in 46% of isolates. 67% of isolates harbored fosA genes; however, only one was fosfomycin-resistant. Two isolates harbored genes conferring resistance to colistin, despite being susceptible. The majority of identified virulome genes were iron uptake siderophores. Two enterobactins (entB, fepC), six adherence-related genes belonging to E. coli common pilus (ECP) and one secretion system (ompA gene) were found in all isolates. In contrast, yersiniabactin was found in two isolates. One ST23 strain was susceptible to all tested antibiotics, and harbored determinants discriminatory for hypervirulent strains, e.g., aerobactin, salmochelin, yersiniabactin, enterobactin and regulator of mucoid phenotype A genes that are highly associated with hypervirulent K. pneumoniae. The IncF plasmid family was found in all strains, while almost half of the isolates harbored Col440I-type plasmids and nine isolates harbored various Inc-type plasmids.

The toxicity of OBS has received increasing attention. Pituitary cells are components of the endocrine system and act as vital regulators of homeostatic endocrine balance. However, the effects of OBS on pituitary cells remain unknown. The present study explores the effects of OBS (0.5, 5, and 50 μM) on GH3 rat pituitary cells after treatment for 24, 48, and 72 h. We found that OBS significantly inhibited cell proliferation in GH3 cells with remarkable senescent phenotypes, including enhanced SA-β-gal activity and expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related genes, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of the senescence-related proteins γ-H2A.X and Bcl-2. OBS caused significant cell cycle arrest of GH3 cells at the G1-phase and concomitantly downregulated the expression of some key proteins for the G1/S transition, including cyclin D1 and cyclin E1. Consistently, the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB), which plays a central role in regulating the cell cycle, was prominently reduced after OBS exposure. Furthermore, OBS notably activated the p53-p21 signalling pathway in GH3 cells, as evidenced by increased p53 and p21 expressions, enhanced p53 phosphorylation, and augmented p53 nuclear import. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal that OBS triggers senescence in pituitary cells via the p53-p21-RB signalling pathway.

When exposed to PFOS, the cyanobacterium was sensitive to it, showing significant inhibition of growth and reduction of pigment content. At the same time, exposure to PFOS resulted in a two-fold increase of the content of total carbohydrates and soluble proteins in the cells of M. aeruginosa. There was a significant increase in MDA and H2O2 levels in cells exposed to PFOS, but not in a concentration-dependent manner. Microcystin content tended to increase in PFOS-exposed cyanobacterial cells, although this change was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that when surfactants like PFOS are used in large quantities or concentrations, they could adversely affect Microcystis populations in the aquatic environment. © 2023 International Phycological Society.",NA,10.1080/00318884.2023.2189408,Physiology;Toxicity;Cyanobacteria;Cyanotoxins;Heptadecafluorooctanesulfonic acid;Antioxidants;Surface-Active Agents,NA,NA

Concerns surrounding toxicity have led to numerous animal-based toxicity studies. Due to the ubiquity of PFAS and the low parts per trillion (ppt) health advisory levels for drinking water, several contamination elimination protocols have been implemented. In addition, it is urgently necessary to perform low-dose experiments, but due to unknown pathways for entry of unwanted PFAS, low-dose studies are extremely challenging to conduct. However, animal feed sources are a likely route that could introduce unwanted PFAS into experiments, yet investigations of PFAS in common animal feeds are lacking. Here, we report the examination of PFAS levels in eighteen different animal feeds, representing a range of diets fed to diverse taxa. We evaluated whether PFAS levels in feeds were correlated with ingredient composition (plant versus animal-based) or dietary habits of lab animals (amphibian, fish, invertebrate, mammal). PFOS, PFHxS, PFOA, and short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids had the highest detection levels and frequencies across all samples. Different food ingredients led to different PFAS profiles. No meaningful levels of PFAS precursors were detected. We demonstrate that PFAS contamination in animal feed is pervasive. Reducing food-sourced PFAS is a critical, albeit challenging task to improve interpretability of in vivo exposures. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161583,Biochemistry;PFAS;Ecotoxicology;Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;PFOS;Animals;Article;Bioaccumulation;Carboxylic Acids;animal;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;dietary intake;bioaccumulation;chemistry;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;Mammals;diet;fish;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;quality control;pollution exposure;alkanesulfonic acid;high performance liquid chromatography;risk assessment;toxicity;Toxicity;heavy metal;carboxylic acid;ecotoxicology;drinking water;Potable water;polyfluoroalkyl substance;limit of quantitation;limit of detection;zebra fish;Drinking Water;Diet;animal food;Animal Feed;biotransformation;environment;fresh water;Eco-toxicology;mammal;Low dose;Water Pollutants;Chemical;laboratory method;Amphibia;Toxicity testing;Chemical stability;Amphiphilicity;artemia;Artemia;chemical stabilities;food ingredient;mycotoxin;perfluorolkyl substance;Perfluorolkyl substance;ployfluoroalkyl substance;Ployfluoroalkyl substance;protein restriction;Thermal;Animal Shells;Toxicity Tests,NA,NA

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are fundamental utilities in cities, playing an important role in preventing water pollution by lowering pollution load in waste waters. However, some of the emerging organic pollutants, like PFCs cannot be efficiently removed by traditional biological technologies in WWTPs, and some even increase in effluents compared to influents due to the incomplete degradation of precursors. Hence, WWTPs are considered to be a main point source in cities for PFCs that enter the aquatic environment. However, the mass flow of PFCs from WWTPs has seldom been analyzed for a whole city. Hence, in the present study, 11 PFCs including series of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs, C4-C12) and two perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFASs, C6 and C8) were measured in WWTP influents and effluents and sludge samples from six municipal WWTPs in Tianjin, China. Generation and dissipation of the target PFCs during wastewater treatment process and their mass flow in effluents were discussed. Results: All the target PFCs were detected in the six WWTPs, and the total PFC concentration in different WWTPs was highly influenced by the population density and commercial activities of the corresponding catchments. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the predominant PFC in water phase, with concentrations ranging from 20 to 170 ng/L in influents and from 30 to 145 ng/L in effluents. Concentrations of perfluoroalkyl sulfonates decreased substantially in the effluent compared to the influent, which could be attributed to the sorption onto sludge, whereas concentrations of PFOA and some other PFCAs increased in the effluent in some WWTPs due to their weaker sorption onto solids and the incomplete degradation of precursors. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was the predominant PFC in sludge samples followed by PFOA, and their concentrations ranged from 42 to 169 g/kg and from 12 to 68 g/kg, respectively. Sludge-wastewater distribution coefficients (log Kd) ranged from 0. 62 to 3. 87 L/kg, increasing with carbon chain length of the homologues. The mass flow of some PFCs in the effluent was calculated, and the total mass flow from all the six municipal WWTPs in Tianjin was 26, 47, and 3. 5 kg/year for perfluorohexanoic acid, PFOA, and PFOS, respectively. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",NA,10.1007/s11356-011-0727-6,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;effluent;wastewater;Carboxylic Acids;China;fluorocarbon;bioaccumulation;water pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;water pollution;Perfluorinated compounds;article;carboxylic acid;Water Pollution;octanoic acid derivative;organic pollutant;Sewage;sludge;water treatment;persistence;population density;Cities;city;Alkanesulfonates;Octanoic Acids;Distribution;sewage;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Fluid;Waste Disposal;pollutant removal;point source;Tianjin;Mass flow;dissipation;WWTPs,NA,NA

Boar meat therefore plays a definite role in regard to human diet. Because they are omnivores and because of their high body fat quotient, wild boar may accumulate large concentrations of persistent organic compounds, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, and could thus possibly serve as bioindicators for persistent xenobiotics. In addition, consumption of wild boar meat and liver could lead to increased contaminant levels in humans. Between 2007 and 2009, we tested a total of 529 livers and 506 muscle tissue samples from wild boar for the presence of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). PFOA concentrations ≤45 μg/kg and PFOS concentrations ≤1,780 lg/kg were detected in the liver samples. PFOA concentrations ≤7.4 μg/kg and PFOS concentrations ≤28.6 μg/kg were detected in muscle tissue. Our results show that PFOS may be detected in considerably greater concentrations than PFOA in organs and tissues, which is in agreement with results from other published studies. The comparisons between both organs for the same substance, as well as the comparisons between the substances within an organ, showed clear and statistically significant differences at P<0.0001.

The interactions of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with DNA were investigated by equilibrium dialysis, circular dichroism and isothermal titration calorimetry techniques under normal physiological conditions in vitro. The binding of PFOA to DNA was a non-covalent interaction and corresponded to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm in a two-step binding model, in which PFOA climbed along the backbones of DNA and then interacted with the homolateral bases via hydrophobic interactions. The saturation number of PFOA was calculated to be 0.64 per base-pair of DNA. Such an interaction caused the enhancement of circular dichroism spectra of DNA at both 245 and 275 nm, indicating the change of DNA conformation. The acidic media, low electrolyte and temperature ≤35 °C are comparatively more favorable for PFOA binding to DNA.

However, the mechanistic linkage between PFAS exposure and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains largely elusive. Objectives: This study aimed to explore PFAS-to-NAFLD link and the relevant molecular mechanisms. Methods: The cross-sectional analyses using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data were conducted to investigate the association between PFAS exposure and NAFLD. A combination of in silico toxicological analyses, bioinformatics approaches, animal experiments, and in vitro assays was used to explore the molecular initiating events (MIEs) and key events (KEs) in PFAS-induced hepatic lipid metabolism disorders. Results: The cross-sectional analyses with NHANES data revealed the significant association between PFAS exposure and hepatic steatosis/NAFLD. The in silico toxicological analyses showed that PPARα activation induced by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), prototypical representatives of PFAS, is the critical MIE associated with NAFLD-predominant liver diseases. Transcriptome-based bioinformatic annotation and analyses identified that transcriptional upregulation of hepatic acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) in PPARα-regulated peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway was the KE involved with PFOA/PFOS-perturbed hepatic lipid metabolic pathways in humans, mice and rats. The in vivo and in vitro assays further verified that ACOX1-mediated oxidative stress contributed to mitochondrial compromise and lipid accumulation in PFOA/PFOS-exposed mouse hepatocytes, which could be mitigated by co-treatment with ACOX1 inhibitor and mitochondria ROS scavenger. Additionally, we observed that besides PFOA and PFOS, hepatic ACOX1 exhibited good-fit response to short-term exposures of long-chain (C7-C10) perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFHpA, PFNA, PFDA) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFHpS, PFDS) in human hepatocyte spheroids through benchmark dose (BMD) modeling.

Dolphins consume the same food and share the coastal environment with humans thus serving also as effective sentinels for public health problems. In this dissertation, the latest new technologies in cell and molecular biology are applied to the study of bottlenose dolphin biology and health. Included in the new technologies presented are the most used (microarray) and the most current (RNA sequencing, RNAseq) transcriptomic approaches, and novel technologies in stem cell research for subsequent in vitro testing. In the first investigation, an ex vivo assay was applied to gene expression microarrays. Small slices of bioptic skin from the bottlenose dolphin were cultured and exposed to different concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and bisphenol A (BPA), to assess the variation in global gene expression induced by two contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs). Transcriptomic changes were analyzed using a species-specific microarray. The skin transcriptome hold information on contaminant exposure, potentially predictive of longterm effects on dolphin health. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes have shown to be a good resource for identification of contaminant-specific biomarkers of exposure. Although microarrays technology continues to advance generating high throughput transcriptomics, it can only be employed to detect known sequences, and can’t be used to discover novel RNA forms and variants.

PFOA concentration ranged between 1 and 13 ng/L in seawater and between 0 and 794 ng/g in P. oceanica. The analyses carried out on individuals of P. lividus from the least polluted site (A) showed PFOA median values equal to 0 in all the matrices (coelomic fluid, coelomocytes and gonads). Conversely, individuals collected from the most polluted site (B) showed median PFOA concentrations of 21 ng/g in coelomic fluid, 153 ng/g in coelomocytes, and 195 ng/g in gonads. Calculated bioconcentration factors of log10BCF > 3.7 confirmed the very bioaccumulative nature of PFOA.

We estimated in utero PBB exposure using maternal serum PBB measurements taken after exposure (1976-1979) and extrapolated to time of pregnancy using a model of PBB decay. We found that breastfed girls exposed to high levels of PBB in utero (greater than or equal to7 parts per billion) had an earlier age at menarche (mean age = 11.6 years) than breastfed girls exposed to lower levels of PBB in utero (mean age = 12.2-12.6 years) or girls who were not breastfed (mean age = 12.7 years).

Over the past decade, concern has increased over the presence of PFOA in biosolids from wastewater treatment plants used as fertilizer on agricultural lands because of the potential for PFOA to enter the food chain. In this study, the uptake of C-14-PFOA from soil by alfalfa and C-14-PFOA bioavailability from consumption of this alfalfa was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats. Alfalfa leaves accumulated C-14-PFOA up to 4 to 5 mu g/g of dry leaf, approximately 10 times higher than accumulation in the stem. Alfalfa was ground for feeding to 15 female Sprague-Dawley rats (175 to 200 g). Animals within metabolism cages were fed 10 g of feed (6 g of alfalfa plus 4 g of ground rat chow) twice daily for 14 days (equivalent to 50 mu g of C-14-PFOA per kg per day). At the end of the feeding period, three rats were euthanized for sample collection on each of withdrawal days 0, 3, 7, 11, and 14.

The time dependence of both the stable hydrogen isotope ratios and the concentrations was determined using a gas chromatography pyrolysis isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-P-IRMS) system. The following KIE values, in per mil (parts per thousand), were obtained: 39.6 +/- 2.7 (n-butane), 28.2 +/- 0.9 (n-pentane), 24.6 +/- 1.0 (n-hexane), 24.0 +/- 1.2 (n-heptane), 17.9 +/- 3.3 (n-octane), 15.1 +/- 0.7 (n-nonane), and 14.9 +/- 1.8 (n-decane). The errors given are the +/- 1 sigma standard errors. These measured values were used to derive structure-reactivity relationship (SRRs), which allow for the calculation of the KIEs for the reaction of n-alkanes with Cl atoms. The results of the calculations agree with the measurements within few per mil or better. The site specific stable hydrogen isotope fractionation effects for methyl groups are approximately a factor of 3 larger than those for methylene group, a finding which is qualitatively similar to site-specific stable hydrogen isotope effects reported in literature for reactions of alkanes with the OH radical. Because n-alkanes with close to natural isotope ratios (i.e. neither artificially labeled, nor enriched or depleted) were used, the KIE data are directly applicable to atmospheric studies. Based on these KIE values, the impact of Cl-atom reactions of the stable hydrogen isotope ratio on alkanes are estimated for different levels of Cl-atom concentrations. On average in the troposphere, the impact of Cl-atom reactions of the stable hydrogen isotope ratio of n-alkanes will be small. However, in regions of the troposphere with high concentrations of Cl atoms, such as the tropospheric ozone depletion episodes during polar sunrise, the impact of Cl-atom reactions is substantial.",NA,10.1007/s10874-005-2365-1,Kinetics;Hydrogen;Hydrogenation,NA,NA

The total concentration of PFASs in 14 species of fishery organisms ranged from 1.77 ng/g to 31.09 ng/g wet weight, and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFAS. ∑PFASs concentration in surface seawater ranged from 5.54 ng/L to 48.27 ng/L over four seasons, and dry season (winter and spring) had higher levels than wet season (summer and autumn). Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the predominant individual PFAS in seawater, indicating that notorious C8 homologs remained the major PFASs in this region. The seasonal variation in seawater concentrations of three major PFASs, namely, PFOA, perfluoroheptanoic acid, and perfluorononanoic acid, was similar to that of ∑PFASs. However, the seasonal variation of PFOS concentration was different from that of ∑PFASs, with the lowest in winter and the highest in spring. In general, seasonal variations of terrigenous input and water exchange capacity were the main reasons for the spatiotemporal variation of PFASs in the aquatic environment of JZB. Moreover, bioselective enrichment for individual PFAS affected the partition of PFASs in different environment medium. Wet precipitation, sewage discharge, and surface runoff were the main sources of PFASs in this area. Nevertheless, the contribution of different sources to individual PFAS indicated a clear difference, and wastewater and river water were not consistently the most important source for every PFAS.

This work aims to develop and pilot a methodology to help decision makers target and prioritize sampling investigations and identify contaminated natural resources. Here we use random forest models to predict ∑PFAS in fish tissue; understanding PFAS levels in fish is particularly important in the CRB because fish can be a major component of tribal and indigenous people diet. Geospatial data, including land cover and distances to known or potential PFAS sources and industries, were leveraged as predictors for modeling. Models were developed and evaluated for Washington state and Oregon using limited available empirical data. Mapped predictions show several areas where detectable concentrations of PFAS in fish tissue are predicted to occur, but prior sampling has not yet confirmed. Variable importance is analyzed to identify potentially important sources of PFAS in fish in this region. The cost-effective methodologies demonstrated here can help address sparsity of existing PFAS occurrence data in environmental media in this and other regions while also giving insights into potentially important drivers and sources of PFAS in fish.

In particular, long-chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are being replaced with shorter-chain homologues or other fluorinated or non-fluorinated alternatives. A key question is: are these alternatives, particularly the structurally similar fluorinated alternatives, less hazardous to humans and the environment than the substances they replace? Several fluorinated alternatives including perfluoroether carboxylic acids (PFECAs) and perfluoroether sulfonic acids (PFESAs) have been recently identified. However, the scarcity of experimental data prevents hazard and risk assessments for these substances. In this study, we use state-of-the-art in silico tools to estimate key properties of these newly identified fluorinated alternatives. [i] COSMOtherm and SPARC are used to estimate physicochemical properties. The US EPA EPISuite software package is used to predict degradation half-lives in air, water and soil. [ii] In combination with estimated chemical properties, a fugacity-based multimedia mass-balance unit-world model - the OECD Overall Persistence (POV) and Long-Range Transport Potential (LRTP) Screening Tool - is used to assess the likely environmental fate of these alternatives. Even though the fluorinated alternatives contain some structural differences, their physicochemical properties are not significantly different from those of their predecessors. Furthermore, most of the alternatives are estimated to be similarly persistent and mobile in the environment as the long-chain PFASs. The models therefore predict that the fluorinated alternatives will become globally distributed in the environment similar to their predecessors. Although such in silico methods are coupled with uncertainties, this preliminary assessment provides enough cause for concern to warrant experimental work to better determine the properties of these fluorinated alternatives. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.062,Fluorocarbons;PFOS;chemical pollutant;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Risk Assessment;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;environmental monitoring;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;chemistry;procedures;risk assessment;long range transport;environmental fate;soil;water;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;computer model;analysis;PFOA;fluorination;environment;toxic substance;biodegradation;physical chemistry;fluorine;perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid;Environment;physicochemical property;pollutant transport;structure analysis;air;hazard assessment;chemical model;Chemical;polyfluoroalkyl derivative;Models;computer analysis;Environmental fate;In-silico;Fluorinated alternative;modeling;OECD;Hazard assessment;Hazard Assessment;In silico tool,NA,NA

The management of such PFAS-contaminated asphalt materials requires an understanding of PFAS concentrations in these materials. This study, therefore, aimed to develop a suitable extraction methodology for the analysis of 22 target PFAS (i.e., carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and fluorotelomers) in asphalt materials. A series of experiments was conducted to optimise extraction solvent composition, as well as to assess the performance of the chosen method under various conditions (i.e., sonication temperature, PFAS contamination level, asphalt core composition and timing of stable isotope addition used as internal standard). The methanol-based extractants performed best due to their accuracy and precision, which were within the acceptable range (extraction efficiency between 70 and 130% and RSD < 20%). The method which involved three successive extractions with methanol/1% NH3 by ultrasonication at 25 degrees C was selected due to its performance and ease of operation. The mean recovery of a vast majority of PFAS was found to be in the acceptable range. Tests on the timing of addition of stable isotope (SI)-labelled PFAS internal standards indicate that the recoveries obtained, regardless of when the stable isotopes were added, were within the acceptable range for PFAS. The accuracy and precision of PFAS recoveries were not affected by PFAS spike level (2 mu g kg(-1) and 200 mu g kg(-1)), as well as sample composition (based on the location of asphalt material in the field). Low RSDs were achieved for asphalt cores collected from a contaminated site covering a wide range of concentrations (from LOQ to 2135 mg kg(-1)), demonstrating the suitability of the sample preparation method for real-world samples. The results from the interlaboratory testing were also in good agreement and validated the proposed PFAS extraction and analytical approach.",NA,10.1039/d2ay00221c,"Messenger;Poly A-U;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Polyglactin 910;RNA;RNA, Messenger",NA,NA

Eight PFASs were quantified in plasma and milk in mother-pup pairs of hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) during the nursing period, and the role of milk in the transfer process was analyzed. Hooded seal was chosen because of its short lactation period (3-4d), during which the pup feeds only on milk. Placental or lactation transfer would thus be the only source of PFAS in the pup. Of the 8 PFASs analyzed (Sigma(8)PFAS), 7 were found in all samples; therefore, milk is a source to PFASs in pups. Perfluorooctane sulfonate was the dominant PFAS in all samples. Mean Sigma(8)PFAS concentrations were 6.0 ng/g protein (36 ng/g wet wt) in maternal plasma, 0.77 ng/g protein (3.2 ng/g wet wt) in milk, and 12 ng/g protein (66 ng/g wet wt) in pup plasma. Measured concentrations in plasma were within ranges previously reported from other seal species, below known toxicity thresholds for experimental rodents. Individual PFASs differed in transfer efficiency from mother to pup, depending on carbon chain lengths, with the lowest relative transfer for the intermediate-chained PFASs (C9-C10). The results show maternal transfer of PFASs via both milk and the placenta, of which placental transfer is the dominant pathway. (C) 2016 SETAC",NA,10.1002/etc.3623,character(0),NA,NA

Concentrations of total PFASs ranged from nd (below the detection limit) to 1.78 ng/g dw. The predominant PFASs in soils were perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluoro-butanesulfonate (PFBS) with concentrations that ranged from nd to 0.26 ng/g dw and nd to 0.38 ng/g dw, respectively. Results of mass balance analysis also revealed weak associations among concentrations of PFASs, extractable organic fluorine (EOF), and total fluorine (TF). PFASs were relatively evenly distributed among locations. Due to the absence of direct emission of PFASs and slow development of local industry, PFASs in soils originated mostly from long-range atmospheric transport, consumer use, and disposal of PFASs-containing products.

Norway, Sweden, and Denmark have been particularly progressive in the regulation of the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Restriction proposals have been developed under the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and PFAS have been nominated for global restriction under the Stockholm Convention. A key tool in their work has been the product registries (PRs), where all chemicals imported and produced over a certain reporting limit must be registered by the importers and/or producers. In recent years these PRs have been facing opposition, predominantly from the industry. Simultaneously, and in some contrast, several EU countries are mobilizing for measures to control PFAS as a group. We explored the role of PRs in national and international chemical management. By analyzing the Norwegian PFAS data (2009–2017) reported by industry to the government we observed changes in use and temporal trends. A diversification in use and substitutions to alternative PFAS emerged when new policies were developed, representing a challenge for future control and reduction efforts. Instead of loosening up on reporting obligations, as advocated by some industry representatives, our analysis of the PFAS group argues that governments would benefit from a tighter reporting scheme of problematic compound groups. A comprehensive overview of use, production, and import would contribute to more effective control, thereby saving society and the environment from serious damage and tremendous costs. The Nordic PRs will continue to be important supplements to REACH registration and an indispensable tool for future both national and international regulation on PFAS and other hazardous substances.

Their concentration in the environment usually exceeds the permitted levels, which in turn leads to the possibilities of bio-magnifications and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Consequently, they constitute safety hazards and it is important to remove this class of compounds.

In ovo nanoinjection was used to simulate the maternal transfer process. Doses were controlled at 0, 0.05, 0.5, and 2.5 ng/egg (TBT) and at 0, 0.05, 0.5, and 5.0 ng/egg (PFOS), with a full factorial design for mixture formulations.

The interaction between TBT and PFOS in mixtures had significant effects on the observed hatching delay, but not on acute mortality. Compared with controls, separate exposure to TBT (or PFOS) notably elevated adipose areas at the doses of 0.05 and 0.5 ng/egg, but not at the highest doses. Combined exposure significantly promoted the fat accumulation in newly hatched larvae, even when the doses of TBT and PFOS were both at the levels that did not show obesogenic effect.

Here, we propose a novel use of PFAS fingerprints in fish tissue from surface water systems to classify exposure from multiple sources of PFASs using a proof-of-concept demonstration. Three supervised ML classification techniques (k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, support vector machines) implementing two predictive features are used to classify literature-reported PFAS fingerprints in fish (n = 1057). The importance of additional predictive features was explored using brute force optimization of a multifeature KNN algorithm. The multiclass classification considered exposure to aqueous film-forming foam-impacted water, paper industry wastewater, diffuse sources, or PFASs undergoing long-range transport. The optimized classifiers demonstrated 85%-94% classification accuracy for this first known multiclass classification of PFASs for environmental forensics.

Detectable amounts of PFASs, and particularly perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), have been found in the environment, wildlife and humans. Nowadays, the presence of PFASs and its global distribution is well known. However, there is still a high degree of uncertainty in the pathways of exposure through which PFASs enter the human body. Similarly to “classical” persistent organic pollutants (POPs), dietary intake seems to be the predominant exposure route, with water consumption being identified as a potentially important pathway. Since most human exposure to PFASs occurs in indoor environments, the inhalation of indoor air and the ingestion of dust might notably contribute to the total intake of PFASs. In fact, some investigations point out the possibility that, because of higher dust ingestion rates, the PFAS exposure for toddlers could be much higher than that for adults. Even more, the children intake of PFASs could be dominated by dust ingestion, instead of food as the most important exposure pathway. In this paper, we review a number of recent of studies reporting concentrations of PFASs in dust and estimations on the human exposure via dust ingestion. An important geographical variation among countries was observed, therefore indicating that the assessment of this pathway should be performed in a case-by-case basis. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,10.2174/1385272819666140804230713,PFOS;Dust;PFOA;Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs);Ingestion;Eating,NA,NA

These chemicals are persistent, can accumulate in humans' and animals' tissues and in the environment, representing an increasing concern due to their moderate to highly toxicity. Their global distribution, persistence and toxicity led to an urgent need to investigate bioaccumulation also in marine species. In 2013 PFAS contamination was detected in a vast area in Veneto region, mainly in Adige and Brenta rivers. In order to investigate any relevant presence of these substances in marine vertebrates constantly living in the area, PFAS were measured in hepatic tissue samples of 20 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) stranded along the northern Adriatic Sea coastline between 2008 and 2020. Using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 17 target PFAS (PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS, PFDS, PFHpS, PFPeS), were quantified in the samples. PFAS profiles were generally composed of the same five dominant PFAS (PFOS > PFUnA > PFDA approximate to PFDoA approximate to PFTrDA). The greatest PFOS concentration found was 629,73 ng/g wet weight, and PFOS accounted until 71% in the PFAS profiles. No significant differences between sexes were found, while calves showing higher mean values than adults, possibly indicating an increasing ability in the elimination of PFAS with age. Finally, a temporal analysis was carried out considering three different periods of time, but no temporal differences in concentrations were found. The results suggest that long-chain PFAS are widespread in bottlenose dolphins along the North Adriatic Sea. Furthermore, they represent a baseline to investigate the impact of PFAS on marine mammals' conservation and health.

The aim of the present study was to screen the heavy metal concentrations in multiple bird species across Pakistan and to preliminary evaluate the influence of taxa, trophic level, and geographical location on heavy metal accumulation in various bird species. For this purpose, we measured the concentration of 9 heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Co, Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn) in feathers of 48 bird species from different localities in Pakistan. Species exhibited heterogeneous levels of heavy metals in feathers with marked inter and intra specific variations. Mean concentrations of studied metals in feathers followed the trend Fe > Zn > Cu > Pb > Mn > Cr > Ni > Co > Cd. Species belonging to closely related taxa (families) showed comparable metal concentrations in their feathers, inferring potential phylogenetic similarities in metal exposure or accumulation. In general, concentrations of metals were greatest in carnivorous species followed by omnivorous and insectivorous birds, and granivores showing minimal levels (p < 0.000). Furthermore, concentrations of metals varied significantly between locations (p < 0.000) exhibiting highest concentrations in Punjab province and Baluchistan, probably due to higher industrial and agricultural activity and runoff, respectively. With certain limitation, influence of trophic level, taxonomic affiliation and sampling location of birds on toxic metal accumulation was also statistically corroborated through principal component analysis (PCA). This study highlights that despite restricted emissions, heavy metals persist in the local environment and may pose elevated risks for the studied bird species in Pakistan. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We have carefully reviewed relevant research over the past 10 years. The study focuses on five typical EPs: pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), drinking water disinfection byproducts (DBPs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and microplastics (MPs). The presence of EPs in the global aquatic environment is source-dependent, with wastewater treatment plants being the main source of EPs. Multiple studies have consistently shown that the final destination of most EPs in the water environment is sludge and sediment. Simultaneously, a number of EPs, such as PFASs, MPs, and BFRs, have long-term environmental transport potential. Some EPs exhibit notable tendencies towards bioaccumulation and biomagnification, while others pose challenges in terms of their degradation within both biological and abiotic treatment processes. The results showed that, in most cases, the ecological risk of EPs in aquatic environments was low, possibly due to potential dilution and degradation. Future research topics should include adding EPs detection items for the aquatic environment, combining pollution, and updating prediction models.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171388,Fluorocarbons;Environmental Monitoring;Bioaccumulation;Risk Assessment;Environmental Pollutants;Emerging pollutants;Risk assessment;metabolism;Plastics;analysis;Microplastics;Water Pollutants;Chemical;Aquatic environments;0;Index Medicus;methods,NA,NA

Due to their lipophilic nature, microplastics have the potential to adsorb persistent organic pollutants present in contaminated regions, which may increase their detrimental impact once assimilated by organisms. This study investigates the ecotoxicological effects of exposure to low-density polyethylene (LDPE) microplastics (11-13 μm), with and without adsorbed contaminants (benzo[a]pyrene-BaP and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid-PFOS), in the peppery furrow shell clam, Scrobicularia plana. Environmentally relevant concentrations of contaminants (BaP-16.87 ± 0.22 μg g-1 and PFOS-70.22 ± 12.41 μg g-1) were adsorbed to microplastics to evaluate the potential role of plastic particles as a source of chemical contamination once ingested. S. plana were exposed to microplastics, at a concentration of 1 mg L-1, in a water-sediment exposure setup for 14 days. Clams were sampled at the beginning of the experiment (day 0) and after 3, 7, and 14 days. BaP accumulation, in whole clam tissues, was analyzed. A multi-biomarker assessment was conducted in the gills, digestive gland, and haemolymph of clams to clarify the effects of exposure. This included the quantification of antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) and biotransformation (glutathione-S-transferases) enzyme activities, oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation levels), genotoxicity (single and double strand DNA breaks), and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity). Results suggest a potential mechanical injury of gills caused by ingestion of microplastics that may also affect the analyzed biomarkers. The digestive gland seems less affected by mechanical damage caused by virgin microplastic exposure, with the MPs-adsorbed BaP and PFOS exerting a negative influence over the assessed biomarkers in this tissue. © 2018 O'Donovan, Mestre, Abel, Fonseca, Carteny, Cormier, Keiter and Bebianno.",NA,10.3389/fmars.2018.00143,Neurotoxicity;DNA damage;Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid;Oxidative stress;Polyethylene;Benzo[a]pyrene;Oxidative damage,NA,NA

The anode materials are of different primary compositions (Ti4O7 or Ti9O17) and have different porous structures. The experiment results along with electrochemical characterization and density functional theory (DFT) computation reveal that the greater fraction of Ti3+ ion in Ti4O7 than that in Ti9O17 enhances the anodic reactivity by increasing the affinity of PFOS and reducing the energy barrier of direct electron transfer, leading to greater PFOS degradation efficiency. The data also suggest that the pores in the TSO anodes with sizes smaller than 1.03 μm do not contribute to their effective electroactive surface because of restrictive electrolyte transport, and thus may not contribute to PFOS degradation.

Cencerns regarding potential harmful effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) have been raised. Previous studies reported that PFOS causes various adverse effects such as immunotoxicity and neurotoxicity. This report studied whether PFOS affects mast cells-mediated allergic inflammation. Methods: Ovalbumin-induced active systemic anaphylaxis model was used to assess for the type I hypersensitivity. After sensitization, mice were orally administered with PFOS and then allergic symptoms such as hypothermia and increase of serum allergic mediator were measured. In additional, this study investigated whether PFOS deteriorate allergic inflammation in immunoglobulin E-stimulated mast cells. Results: PFOS aggravated the allergic symptoms such as hypothermia, and increase of serum histamine, tumor necrosis factor-α and immunoglobulin (Ig) E/ G1. PFOS increased the release of histamine and β-hexosaminidase through the up-regulation of intracellular calcium in IgE-stimulated mast cells. PFOS also enhanced the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activating nuclear factor-κB. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that PFOS more intensifies the mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation. © 2018, The Korean Society of Toxicogenomics and Toxicoproteomics and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",NA,10.1007/s13273-018-0019-z,Article;male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;mouse;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;gene expression;Perfluorooctane sulfonate;animal cell;animal model;Western blotting;protein expression;signal transduction;ovalbumin;upregulation;allergy;hypersensitivity;cell viability;cytotoxicity;immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein;tumor necrosis factor;immunoglobulin E;inflammation;calcium cell level;pathogenesis;calcium ion;histamine;luciferase assay;Allergic inflammation;beta n acetylhexosaminidase;Histamine;histamine blood level;histamine release;hypothermia;immunoglobulin G1;mast cell;Mast cells;Nuclear factor-κB;systemic anaphylaxis;Sulfones;Mast Cells;Histamine Release;Inflammation,NA,NA

Regarding GC–MS, the use of a semi-polar GC column (DB-624, 6%-cyanopropilphenyl 94%-dimethyl polysiloxane) allowed the adequate separation of all the compounds while chemical ionisation (CI) of positive ions as ionisation technique provided the best responses. Concerning UHPLC–MS/MS, atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) and photoionisation (APPI) sources allowed the ionisation of all studied neutral PFASs, including FTOs for the first time. High vaporizer temperatures (450 °C) and acetonitrile/water mobile phase mixtures were required to favour the ionisation of FTOs, with adequate ionisation for FTOHs, FOSAs and FOSEs. The chromatographic separation, performed on a totally porous column (Luna C18), allowed the successful separation of the four families of neutral PFASs. After comparing the performance of the studied methods, the highest detectability was achieved using UHPLC–APCI–MS/MS and it was chosen in combination with a solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure for the analysis of neutral PFASs in water samples. The whole method provided low limits of detection (0.003–6 µg L–1), good precision (RSD < 9%) and trueness (relative error < 10%).

This study here sought to examine the ability of PFOS to potentially perturb T-helper (T H)-1 and T H-2 cell cytokine secreting activities, as well as to cause shifts in antibody isotype levels, and possible mechanisms involved in PFOS-induced immunotoxicity. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to PFOS daily via gavage for 60 days [0, 0.5, 1, 5, 25, or 50 mg/kg total administered dose (TAD)]. One day after the final exposure, the ex vivo production of the T H1-type cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ), T H2-type (IL-4), and IL-10 cytokines by isolated splenocytes, serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) were assessed via ELISA or ELISPOT. The results showed that IL-4 secretion was increased at exposure ≥5 mg PFOS/kg TAD in a dose-dependent manner. PFOS exposure increased IL-10 but decreased IL-2 and IFN-γ formation markedly at 50 mg PFOS/kg TAD. Serum levels of sheep red blood cells (SRBC)-specific IgM synthesis decreased significantly with PFOS exposure in a dose-related manner; serum SRBC-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgE levels increased with 50 mg PFOS/kg TAD regimens. These results indicated that, after a long-term exposure to PFOS, a host's immune state is likely to be characterized by a shift toward a more T H2-like state that, in turn, may lead to enhancement of their humoral response and suppression of their cellular response at levels of upper range for occupationally exposed workers or approximately 150-fold for general human population. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",NA,10.1007/s00204-011-0661-x,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Cytokines;Animals;Eating;Body Weight;Mice;Immunoglobulin G;Immunoglobulin M;male;Male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;Environmental Pollutants;mouse;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;article;occupational exposure;priority journal;sheep;Sheep;animal cell;animal model;enzyme linked immunosorbent assay;gamma interferon;interleukin 4;spleen cell;cytokine production;immunotoxicity;Perfluorooctanesulfonate;erythrocyte;antibody titer;humoral immunity;Ovis aries;immunoglobulin blood level;Toxicity Tests;concentration response;Mus;immunoglobulin E;long term exposure;cellular immunity;antibody;immunoglobulin G;delayed hypersensitivity;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;C57BL 6 mouse;interleukin 10;interleukin 2;Th1 Th2 balance;cytokine release;Inbred C57BL;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;ex vivo study;adult animal;Subchronic;immunoglobulin G1;Immunoglobulin;immune status;Th1 cell;Th1 Cells;Th2 cell;Th2 Cells;enzyme linked immunospot assay;immunoglobulin production;Interferon-gamma;Interleukin-10;Interleukin-2;Interleukin-4;Type 1 cytokine;Type 2 cytokine,NA,NA

Soil urease activities were inhibited significantly but catalase activities were promoted significantly by interaction of PFASs and Cd which had few effects on sucrase activities. Joint stress with PFASs and Cd decreased the biomass of plants and chlorophyll (Chl) content in both wheat and rapeseed, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities were increased in wheat but inhibited in rapeseed compared with single treatments. The bioconcentration abilities of PFASs in wheat and rapeseed were decreased, and the translocation factor of PFASs was decreased in wheat but increased in rapeseed with Cd addition. The bioaccumulation and translocation abilities of Cd were increased significantly in both wheat and rapeseed with PFASs addition.

A modified high volume air sampler was designed to minimize volatilization from a particulate laden filter; volatilization is one of the major sampling artifacts associated with the collection of ambient aerosols. This study also considers two other major sampling artifacts, gas adsorption to the filter, and chemical reactions on the filter. Concentrations of 16 n-alkanes (hexadecane - hentriacontane) and 8 PAHs (phenanthrene - benzo(a)pyrene) were measured from aerosols collected on quartz fiber filters (QFFs) and Teflon membrane filters (TMFs) for 12 sampling events in Portland, Oregon in 1988 over a range of ambient temperatures (7 -31-degrees-C). The extent to which gas adsorption is important can be examined from the ratios of the concentrations of the target compounds collected on the QFFs to TMFs. It was determined that even though the coefficients of variation in the QFF / TMF ratios were as high as 60%, greater than 50% of the target compounds were collected in significantly higher concentrations on the QFFs. The most likely cause of elevated ratios is gas adsorption to the QFFs, creating artificially high QFF / TMF ratios.

In this study, the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea was employed as a zoobenthos model to study the effects of SPS (collected from the Yellow River) on the bioaccumulation and toxicity (from the molecular level to cellular and physiological levels) caused by PFOS exposure. Besides, the enhanced integrated biomarker response (EIBR) system was applied as an index to evaluate the in-depth toxic effects of PFOS and SPS single and co-exposure at various treatment levels. Our results demonstrated that PFOS-SPS co-exposure (at sub-lethal doses of PFOS) significantly increased the bioaccumulation of PFOS, and induced the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the significantly increased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes, the significantly increased content of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the significantly upregulated expression levels of sod, selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (se-gpx), heat shock protein 22 (hsp22), heat shock protein 40 (hsp40) and cytochrome P450 30 (cyp30) genes. Further, the co-exposure induced the significantly higher histopathological alterations in the gonads and digestive glands, and even elevated the inhibition of siphoning behavior in clams. In addition, the EIBR index also revealed the highest values for PFOS and SPS co-exposure, compared to the individual SPS or PFOS exposure. The results indicated that at high levels of PFOS exposure (especially at 1000 μg/L), the presence of SPS might increase the generation of ROS by influencing the bioaccumulation of PFOS, which enhanced the toxicity of PFOS to C. fluminea.

However, their resulting widespread release into aqueous environments and their potential toxicities to organisms have raised significant environmental concern. Among the various approaches to the removal of PFAS contaminants, adsorption has proven to be highly effective, especially when carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNMs) are used as the adsorbent. Nonetheless, the interfacial adsorption of PFASs on CNMs is affected by many factors. In this work, the adsorption behaviors of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), two highly representative PFASs, on different CNMs are reviewed. We also examine the mechanisms of PFOA and PFOS adsorption on CNMs, including electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, ligand exchange and hydrogen bonding. Due to the significant influence of hydrophobic interactions on adsorption, CNMs rich in oxygen-containing functional groups will result in weaker PFAS adsorption than achieved using pristine materials. The important contribution of nanobubbles to hydrophobic interactions is considered herein. Overall, this work contributes to a better understanding of the adsorption affinity of PFASs on CNMs in water environments. Moreover, it provides the systematic theoretical support that is needed for the more effective use of CNMs in the removal of PFASs from aqueous systems.

Impacts, 2022, 24, 2085) we explored the use of silylium-carborane for the degradation of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and three derivatives. In the course of our study, we found the degradation of the C-F bond was facilitated by a low-lying unoccupied anti-bonding orbital. Based on this finding, we propose the usage of metal catalysts for the degradation of the C-F bond as metals have been shown to take advantage of such low-lying anti-bonding orbitals. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored how the C-F bond in PFBA can be split by the entirety of the d-block metals. Deriving a series of linear scaling relationships, we demonstrate that metals conforming to the bcc point-group perform the best for this chemistry.

Objectives: We hypothesized that PFAAs exposure, as assessed based on serum PFAAs concentrations, would be associated with increased odds of asthma and the levels of key TH2 cytokines in children. Methods: A total of 231 asthmatic children and 225 non-asthmatic controls, all from Northern Taiwan, were recruited in the Genetic and Biomarker study for Childhood Asthma. Serum concentrations of 11 PFAAs and levels of TH1 [interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-12] and TH2 (IL-4 and IL-5) cytokines were also measured. Associations of PFC quartiles with concentrations of immunological markers and asthma outcomes were estimated using multivariable regression models. Results: Asthmatics had serum PFAAs values significantly higher than their healthy counterparts. Adjusted odds ratios for asthma among those with the highest versus lowest quartile of PFAAs exposure ranged from 1.90 (95% CI: 1.08, 3.37) for the perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) to 4.05 (95% CI: 2.21, 7.42) for perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA). PFAAs were associated positively with serum TH2 cytokines and inversely with TH1 cytokines among asthmatics. However, among children without asthma, these associations were not significant. Conclusions: Increased serum PECs levels may promote TH cell dysregulation and alter the availability of key TH1 and TH2 cytokines, effects that could ultimately contribute to development of pulmonary allergic diseases. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",NA,NA,"⛔ No DOI found;Perfluoroalkyl acids;Asthma;Children;T-helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) cytokines;T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokines;Case-Control Studies;T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer",NA,NA

Furthermore, the effects of prenatal exposure to PFASs on hormones in the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis of newborns remain largely unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations of prenatal exposure to PFASs with the neonatal birth size, GH, IGF-1, and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3). The concentrations of 22 PFASs were measured in the plasma of 224 pregnant women collected within 3 days before delivery (39.3 weeks) in Guangzhou, China, and the anthropometric data were gathered from medical records. Paired cord blood was collected at delivery to determine GH, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 levels. Multivariable linear regression models revealed the inverse associations of several long-chain PFASs with birth weight and ponderal index as well as the significant associations of perfluorobutanoic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with IGFBP-3 levels. The Bayesian kernel machine regression confirmed the association of perfluorooctane sulfonate with birth weight and ponderal index and of PFOA with IGFBP-3 and identified an inverse joint effect of exposure to a mixture of multiple PFASs on birth weight.

The lessons of the past demonstrate that, at some point, major challenges to our existing paradigms will eventuate. Key to addressing these challenges is our ability for early identification of ‘blind spots’ not covered by our existing paradigms. Furthermore, if we only look for gross observable changes in the environment, we will only ever be able to respond with reactive measures.

The total PFAS concentration in the area ranged from 16.64–35.70 ng/L, with predominantly perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), collectively contributing 94%. The Mantel test revealed threats to aquatic communities from both legacy long-chain (perfluorooctanoic acid and sodium perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) and emerging (6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid, 2-Perfluorohexyl ethanoic acid, and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (Gen-X)) PFSAs. The canonical correspondence analysis ordination indicated that trace quantities of emerging PFASs, specifically 2-Perfluorohexyl ethanoic acid and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (Gen-X), significantly influenced geographical variations in aquatic communities. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of comprehensively exploring the ecological implications and potential risks associated with PFASs in the Beiluo River Basin. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133808,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Rivers;Article;Environmental Monitoring;Perfluoroalkyl substances;China;concentration (parameter);ecosystem;Ecosystem;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;environmental monitoring;alkyl group;chemical substance;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;sulfonic acid derivative;Dimer acids;Hexafluoropropylene oxide;hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid;human;river water;water;carboxylic acid derivative;toxicology;perfluorocarboxylic acid;river;river basin;freshwater ecosystem;Carboxylic acids;Toxicological effects;aquatic environment;River pollution;aquatic ecosystem;gene sequence;biodiversity;sequence analysis;perfluoroheptanoate;perfluoroalkyl;Water;zooplankton;Aquatic organisms;gene amplification;Perfluorosulfonic acid;Water Pollutants;Biodiversity;benthos;Fluorocarbon Polymers;Chemical;3;Aquatic ecosystems;Per-;3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoate;ammonium 2;polyfluoroalkyl;6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid;Emerging PFASs;Emerging polyfluoroalkyl substance;Propionates;propionic acid;heptanoic acid derivative;DNA extraction;cyanobacterium;2 perfluorohexyl ethanoic acid;Aquatic communities;Beiluo Basin;Heptanoates;Loess Plateau;perfluorosulfonic acid;phytoplankton;polyﬂuoroalkyl substance;polyﬂuoroalkyl substances;River basins;sodium perfluorooctane sulfonic acid;species composition;taxonomic identification;Watersheds,NA,NA

The fact that PFAAs have been detected in various human matrices, together with the resultant potential human health risks, knowledge of possible paths of entry and distribution in various ecosystems, is of great importance. In this context pooled samples of terrestrial ecosystems - roe deer liver (n = 141), earthworms (n = 44) as well as leaves from beech and poplar trees (n = 70) from the year 1989-2015 were obtained from the German Environmental Specimen Bank and examined for the presence of 11 PFAAs for the first time. In addition to determining individual and total PFAA concentrations, temporal trends have been deduced in order to determine the effectiveness of regulatory measures. The highest total mean concentration of PFAAs (sum of the concentrations of the 11 analytes) were 9.9 mu g/kg in the roe deer liver samples, followed by earthworm samples with a mean PFAA concentration of 3.5 mu g/kg and leaves with a mean total concentration of 2.5 mu g/kg. In regard to temporal trends there was a significant reduction of concentrations for perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoic acid, perfiuorononanoic acid and perfluorodecanoic acid in roe deer liver from 2003 to 2015, an indication of the effectiveness of regulatory measures. The same is true for the perfluorooctane sulfonate concentrations in earthworms and for perfluorooctanoic acid concentrations in the leaves. In contrast, an increase in perfluorobutanoic acid concentrations was observed from 2003 to 2015 in all three matrices. In summary it must be noted that in spite of the discernible effectiveness of minimization strategies, PFAAs are still detectable in terrestrial matrices and concentrations of other PFAAs as perfluorobutanoic acid appear to be increasing.

Different hypotheses about sources of variation in perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) concentrations were examined in eggs (n=107) of tawny owls (Strix aluco) collected over a 24-yr period (1986-2009) in Norway. Predictor variables included the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), temperature, snow, food availability (vole abundance), and individual traits such as age, body condition, and clutch size. Concentrations of both perfluoro-octane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) varied several fold in the population, both inter- and intra-annually. Moreover, individuals laid eggs with several times higher or lower PFAS concentrations within few years (1 yr-5 yr). After controlling for temporal trends (i.e., declining PFOS and increasing PFCA concentrations), both PFOS and PFCAs were positively associated to the winter NAO in the previous year (NAOy - 1), suggesting that atmospheric transport may be affecting the input of PFASs to the local ecosystem. Perfluoro-octane sulfonate was negatively related to temperature, but the pattern was complex as there was an interaction between temperature and the feeding conditions. The PFOS accumulation was highest in years with high vole abundance and low to medium temperatures. For PFCAs, there was an interaction between NAOy - 1 and feeding conditions, suggesting that strong air transport toward Norway and high consumption of voles led to a moderate increase in PFCA accumulation. The individual traits, however, had very little impact on the concentrations of PFASs in the eggs. The present study thus suggests that annual variation in environmental conditions influences the concentrations of PFASs in a terrestrial raptor such as the tawny owl. © 2014 SETAC.",NA,10.1002/etc.2782,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Birds;Animals;Article;Carboxylation;Norway;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Raptores;Ovum;Carboxylic Acids;animal;climate change;ecosystem;female;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;unclassified drug;Organic pollutants;bioaccumulation;Environmental Pollutants;persistent organic pollutant;pollutant;chemistry;perfluoro compound;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;principal component analysis;egg;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;perflexane;human;carboxylic acid;terrestrial species;egg laying;Perfluoroalkyl substance;priority journal;feeding;food chain;Atmospheric movements;atmospheric transport;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluorotetradecanoic acid;metabolism;environmental temperature;clutch size;food availability;analysis;reproductive success;toxic substance;owl;perfluoroalkyl carboxylate;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);body constitution;season;morphological trait;environmental factor;Strigiformes;Strix aluco;oocyte;perfluorohexane sulfonate;Age;Atmospheric pressure;Climate;Microtus agrestis;Muridae;North Atlantic oscillation;Owl;perfluoroheptane sulfonic acid;Persistent organic pollutant;snow cover;temperature sensitivity;weather,NA,NA

The presence of PFOS at AFFF training sites was inventoried.One major finding of the study is that a former airfield, abandoned since 1994, may still be a point source of PFAAs to nearby recipients. PFOS and PFOA were ubiquitous in the soil samples at former AFFF training sites with concentrations ranging from 2.18 to 8520ngg-1 dry weight and <0.12-287ngg-1 dry weight respectively. The sum of PFAAs in the groundwater and surface waters ranged from 738 to 51000ngL-1 and <MDL to 79.0ngL-1, respectively. PFOS in European perch ranged from 76.5 to 370ngg-1wet weight muscle tissue which is among the highest previously reported worldwide.

Fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19F NMR) has proven to be a powerful, yet underutilized tool to study PFAS binding; chemical shifts of each fluorine group reflect the local environment along the length of the PFAS molecule. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA), we report dissociation constants, Kd, for four common PFASs well below reported critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) − perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) − as a function of temperature in phosphate buffered saline. Kd values were determined based on the difluoroethyl group adjacent to the anionic headgroups and the terminal trifluoromethyl groups. Our results indicate that the hydrophobic tails exhibit greater binding affinity relative to the headgroup, and that the binding affinities are generally consistent with previous results showing that greater PFAS hydrophobicity leads to greater protein binding. However, the binding mechanism was dominated by entropic hydrophobic interactions attributed to desolvation of the PFAS tails within the hydrophobic cavities of the protein and on the surface of the protein. In addition, PFNA appears to form hemimicelles on the protein surfaces below reported CMC values.

The exposure levels of Cl-PFESAs in the general population were investigated by collecting blood samples (n = 1516) from residents of seven cities in central and eastern China. 6:2 Cl-PFESA was observed as the third-highest contributing polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) (8.69%), with the median concentration at 2.18 ng/mL, indicating its importance for assessing the human exposure risks of PFASs. The regional difference between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) can be explained by their use pattern in China. Overall, similar to PFOS, 6:2 Cl-PFESA displays significantly increasing levels with increasing age for both males and females, with significantly higher levels in males. However, a significant sex dependence was found for 6:2 Cl-PFESA in one specific age group (41–60), while there was no significance in the other groups although males display higher levels than females.

Depuration can remove PFASs from the tissues of some species once they are removed from the contaminant source, but it is not known if this process occurs for saltwater crustaceans. Such information is important for managing human health risks for exploited migratory species following exposure. We present the results of a depuration trial for School Prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) and Mud Crab (Scylla serrata), two commercially important crustaceans in Australia. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were present in samples of both species collected following exposure under natural conditions in contaminated estuaries. Depuration was tested in uncontaminated water for 33 days. PFOA was present at levels close to LOR in both species, and was not detected after 4.5 h and 72 h in School Prawn and Mud Crab respectively. PFHxS was rapidly depurated by School Prawn, and had a depuration half-life of 5.7 h. PFOS was also depurated by School Prawn, with a depuration half-life of 158.5 h. PFHxS and PFOS concentrations were highly variable in Mud Crab both at the start, and during the depuration experiment, and a depuration model could not be fitted to the data. For School Prawn, depuration of total PFASs to the relevant screening value for protection of human health (9.1 μg kg− 1) occurred within 7.1 h. Rapid depuration of PFASs in School Prawn indicates that human health risks associated with consumption may decrease as this species migrates away from the contamination source. Further research is required to better understand the relationships between contaminant load and life-history characteristics (such as growth, reproduction, and moult cycle) in Mud Crab, and future work should target broader time frames for depuration in this species. © 2016",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.116,Fluorocarbons;PFOS;PFASs;Animals;Article;Environmental Monitoring;animal;female;fluorocarbon;male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;controlled study;environmental monitoring;animal tissue;Health risks;water pollutant;Histology;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;perfluorohexanesulfonic acid;perfluorohexanoic acid;quantitative analysis;sulfonate;Tissue;Contamination;water contamination;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluorodecane sulfonate;perfluoroheptanoic acid;perfluorobutane sulfonate;Australia;detection method;Estuaries;estuary;half life time;analysis;Caprylates;octanoic acid derivative;depuration;health risk;chemical phenomena;Fisheries;Health;sea food;Seafood;Exposure;concentration (parameters);Invertebrata;polyfunctional group;Shellfish;Alkanesulfonates;Crustacea;Water Pollutants;Elimination;invertebrate;Decapoda (Crustacea);Chemical;polyfluoroalkyl;Metapenaeus macleayi;Penaeidae;Scylla serrata;shrimp fishery,NA,NA

Here, we validated an analytical procedure for 42 PFAS with individual detection limits of 0.001–0.082 ng/L. We also evaluated how different sample pH conditions, dechlorinating agents, and storage holding times might affect method performance. PFAS were analyzed in tap water samples collected at a large spatial scale in Quebec, Canada, covering 376 municipalities within 17 administrative regions. Target and nontarget screening revealed the presence of 31 and 23 compounds, respectively, representing 24 homolog classes. Overall, 99.3% of the tap water samples were positive for at least one PFAS, and the ƩPFAS ranged from below detection limits to 108 ng/L (95th percentile: 13 ng/L). On average, ƩPFAS was 12 times higher in tap water produced from surface water than groundwater; however, 6 of the top 10 contaminated locations were groundwater-based. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) had high detection rates (88% and 80%, respectively). PFOS (median: 0.15 ng/L; max: 13 ng/L) and PFOA (median: 0.27 ng/L; max: 8.1 ng/L) remained much lower than current Health Canada guidelines but higher than USEPA's interim updated health advisories.

The Dongjiang River is one of the most important water sources in the Pearl River Delta region. It flows from Jiangxi Province to Guangdong Province and finally into the Pearl River, providing domestic water for cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. In this study, 17 PFASs in water, sediment, and fish in the Dongjiang River Basin in southern China were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total PFAS concentrations ranged from 20.83 to 372.8 ng/L in water, from 1.050 to 3.050 ng/g in sediments, and from 12.28 to 117.4 ng/g in fish. Among six species of fish, Oreochromis mossambicus (mean: 68.55 ng/g) had the highest concentration of PFASs, while Tilapia zillii (36.90 ng/g) had the lowest concentration. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) predominates in water and sediments, while perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) predominates in fish. Long-chain perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonates (PFSAs) showed higher bioaccumulation, and the field-sourced sediment-water partition coefficients (Kd) and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of PFASs increased with the length of perfluorocarbon chains. PFAS concentration in the lower reaches (urban area) of the Dongjiang River is higher than that in the upper and middle reaches (rural area).

In this study, we analyzed 64 lipophilic POPs, including four emerging BFRs, in the blubber, liver and muscle of 17 adult common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) from the Barents Sea to investigate occurrence and tissue partitioning. In addition, the placental transfer concentration ratios of 14 PFAS and 17 metals were quantified in the muscle of nine female-fetus pairs to investigate placental transfer. Legacy lipophilic POPs were the dominating compound group in every tissue, and we observed generally lower levels compared to previous studies from 1992 to 2001. We detected the emerging BFRs hexabromobenzene (HBB) and pentabromotoluene (PBT), but in low levels compared to the legacy POPs. We detected nine PFAS, and levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were higher than detected from the same population in 2011, whilst levels of Hg were comparable to 2011. Levels of lipophilic contaminants were higher in blubber compared to muscle and liver on both a wet weight and lipid adjusted basis, but tissue partitioning of the emerging BFRs could not be determined due to the high number of samples below the limit of detection. The highest muscle sigma PFAS levels were quantified in fetuses (23 +/- 8.7 ng/g ww), followed by adult males (7.2 +/- 2.0 ng/gg ww) and adult females (4.5 +/- 1.1 ng/g ww), showing substantial placental transfer from mother to fetus. In contrast, Hg levels in the fetus were lower than the mother. Levels were under thresholds for risk of health effects in the whales.

Although PFOS environmental levels and the adverse effects on classical model organisms in toxicological studies are well known, including developmental alterations and alteration of oxidative status, its toxicity to free-living species has been seldom investigated. The aim of this study was to assess the potential toxicity of environmental levels of PFOS to yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos under field experimental conditions. In a within-clutch experimental design, we injected two PFOS concentrations (100 ng PFOS/g egg weight and 200 ng PFOS/g egg weight) in ovo soon after laying. Eggs were collected when they reached the cracking stage. We investigated the effects of PFOS treatment, laying order and sex on both morphological and biochemical endpoints of embryos. Specifically, we assessed changes in embryo body mass and tarsus length, as well as in liver and brain mass. Moreover, the imbalance of oxidative status was evaluated in both liver and brain from embryos by measuring total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS), while the levels of protein carbonyl content (PCO) and DNA fragmentation were measured as oxidative and genetic damage endpoints, respectively. The concentrations of PFOS we tested did not significantly alter the morphological endpoints, independently of laying order and sex. Similarly, embryo oxidative status and oxidative and genetic damage were not significantly affected by PFOS in ovo exposure. These findings suggest that current environmental PFOS levels do not affect early development of yellow-legged gull embryos. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,10.1007/s11356-015-5248-2,Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS);Alkanesulfonic Acids;Eggs;Female;Fluorocarbons;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Liver;animal;Charadriiformes;ecosystem;Ecosystem;female;fluorocarbon;bird;environmental monitoring;Larus michahellis;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);egg;alkanesulfonic acid;surfactant;embryology;embryo;liver;morphology;metabolism;analysis;environment;genotoxicity;Embryotoxicity;Spondias purpurea;biochemical composition;environmental factor;drug effects;Environment;antioxidant;experimental design;protein carbonylation;Protein Carbonylation;Yellow-legged gull;genetic damage;Oxidative;Sulfones;Leg,NA,NA

A few studies revealed the hepatotoxicity of 6:2 Cl-PFESA in animals, but the underlying toxicity mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the lipid metabolism disorders of 6:2 Cl-PFESA through miRNA-gene interaction mode in Huh-7 cells. Our results showed that 6:2 Cl-PFESA significantly promoted cellular lipid accumulation and increased the expression of Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), with the lowest effective concentrations (LOECs) of 3 μM. In silico analysis showed that hsa-miR-532–3p is a potential miRNA molecule targeting ACOX1. Fluorescent-based RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (FREMSA) and ACOX1-mediated luciferase reporter gene assays showed that hsa-miR-532–3p could directly bind to ACOX1 and inhibit its transcription activity. Besides, 6:2 Cl-PFESA decreased the expression of hsa-miR-532–3p in the PPARα-independent manner. Overexpression of hsa-miR-532–3p promoted 6:2 Cl-PFESA-induced cellular lipid accumulation and decreased the ACOX1 production in Huh-7 cells. Taken together, at human exposure relevant concentrations, 6:2 Cl-PFESA might upregulate the expression levels of ACOX1 through downregulating hsa-miR-532–3p, and disturbed lipid homeostasis in Huh-7 cells, which revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism of 6:2 Cl-PFESA-induced hepatic lipid toxic effects. © 2021 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113011,Article;RNA;unclassified drug;controlled study;lipid;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;concentration (composition);gene expression;embryo;liver toxicity;human;toxicity test;metabolism;down regulation;microRNA;computer model;protein expression;signal transduction;upregulation;human cell;genetic analysis;fluorescence analysis;mitochondrion;lipid storage;epigenetics;acyl coenzyme A oxidase;homeostasis;gene overexpression;lipid homeostasis;chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate;6:2 Cl-PFESA;acyl coenzyme A oxidase 1;protein expression level;luciferase assay;lowest-observed-effect concentration;ACOX1;disorders of lipid metabolism;electrophoretic mobility;Hsa-miR-532–3p;Huh-7 cell line;Lipid metabolism disorders;microRNA 532 3p;Sulfones;Lipid Metabolism;Ethers,NA,NA

We collected surface water samples from the Baoshan Reservoir of Taiwan and used Positive Matrix Factorization to attribute PFAS contaminants to possible sources. The health index (HI) was used to evaluate the health risk, which was then compared to various international advisory level guidelines. PFOA and PFOS were found to be the most predominant compounds, with concentrations averaging 20.2 ng/L and 16.7 ng/L, respectively.

They have a wide range of industrial and consumer applications such as stain, paints, hydraulic fluids, firefighting foams, production of fluoropolimers, cosmetics, insecticide formulations, textile treatments, surface coatings for carpets and furniture, cookware and water- and oil- resistant coatings for food contact materials. PFCs are extremely resistant towards thermal, chemical and biological degradation processes. There is now no evidence for their degradability and they decompose only at very high temperatures using a specially prepared furnaces. PFCs tend to accumulate in food chain and animal and human target organs. They have been detected globally as pollutants in water, plants, sediments, foodstuffs, and in animals such as fish, birds, mammals, as well as in human breast milk and blood. Currently, human are on the increased risk as PFCs are resistant to hydrolysis, photolysis, microbial degradation or metabolism. The two most frequently studied PFCs are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), generally considered as reference substances. Their estimated elimination half-life is about 3.8 years for PFOA and 5.4 years for PFOS. It is fully justified, because all of the perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluorine (POSF)-based compounds biologically break down or become metabolised to PFOS. PFOA, in addition to its production and use as a surfactant, is also formed as a degradation product of several fluoropolymers and fluorotelomer alcohol. There is currently no legislation for perfluorinated organic substances such as PFOA and PFOS in food or feed within the EU. There is a number of pathways by which PFCs contamination of humans can take place including diet, food contact materials, non-food personal items, and indoor and outdoor air pollution. Perfluorinated compounds bind to serum albumin and other cytosolic proteins and accumulate mainly in liver and kidney. An important number of studies show that PFCs cause a wide range of negative effects, including hepatic diseases, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. An in vitro and in vivo studies have started to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which PFOA and PFOS exert their adverse effects. However, the specific mechanisms related to these adverse effects is far from being clear.

Furthermore, exposure data measured for rats can be directly applied for risk assessment because many toxicological studies use rodent models. In this study, a nationwide survey of PFASs in the blood of wild rats as well as surface water samples collected from rats' habitats from 47 prefectures in Japan was conducted. In addition to known PFASs, combustion ion chromatography technique was used for analysis of total fluorine concentrations in the blood of rats.

However, the effects of PFOA on individual defense functions in mussels in the presence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) are poorly understood. To investigate the defense strategies and regulatory mechanisms of mussels under combined stressors, the thick-shell mussels Mytilus coruscus were exposed to different PFOA concentrations (0, 2 and 200 μg/L) and nano-TiO2 (0 and 0.1 mg /L, size: 25 nm) for 14 days. The results showed that, compared to the control group, PFOA and nano-TiO2 significantly reduced the number of byssal threads (NBT), byssal threads length (BTL), diameter of proximal threads (DPB), diameter of middle threads (DMB), diameter of distal byssal threads (DDB), adhesive plaque area (BPA), and breaking force of byssal threads (N). Under the influence of PFOA and nano-TiO2, the morphological surface smoothness of the fractured byssal threads surface increased, concurrently inducing an increased surface roughness in the adhesive plaques. Additionally, under the presence of PFOA and nano-TiO2, the foot displayed dispersed tissue organization and damaged villi, accompanied by an increased incidence of cellular apoptosis and an upregulation of the apoptosis gene caspase-8. Expression of the adhesion gene mfp-3 and byssal threads strength genes (preCOL-D, preCOL-NG) was upregulated. An interactive effect on the performance of byssal threads is observed under the combined influence of PFOA and nano-TiO2. Under co-exposure to PFOA and nano-TiO2, the performance of the byssal threads deteriorates, the foot structure is impaired, and the genes mRNA expression of byssal thread secretory proteins have compensated for the adhesion and byssal threads strength by up-regulation. Within marine ecosystems, organic and particulate contaminants exert a pronounced effect on the essential life processes of individual organisms, thereby jeopardizing their ecological niche within community assemblages and perturbing the dynamic equilibrium of the overarching ecosystem.

In Nigeria, which is a major receiver of e-waste and secondhand cars, there is a dearth of information regarding the levels of PBDEs in the environment, biota, and food. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the PBDE contamination of food samples of animal origin (chicken eggs and cow milk) around municipal waste dumpsites and background areas in Nigeria, to elucidate the role of dumpsites as potential sources of PBDE pollution and exposure in the country. Biological samples were collected over two years from two municipal waste dumpsites in Abuja. Fifty-six samples each of free-range chicken eggs and cow milk were collected.

Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, t-test at α 0.05. Levels of Σ 7 PBDEs (ng/g lipid weight (lw)) in chicken eggs at the two study sites ranged from 262.3 to 313.4 (ng/g lw), more than one order of magnitude higher than those at the control site in a village near the dumpsites (14.9 ± 3.73 ng/g lw), and two and more orders of magnitude higher compared to PBDE levels in these products in industrial countries and Nigerian supermarkets. Median PBDE levels in cow milk from the two dumpsites were 49.1 and 81.5 ng/g lw, respectively, considerably higher than levels in other studies. Proper disposal methods of waste polymers containing PBDEs such as co-incineration in BAT cement kilns and plastic recycling with separation is urgently needed in Nigeria and other parts of Africa, to prevent open burning as well as crude recycle to reduce PBDE levels in the environment and human food.

It can be degraded to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in biota and environment. Earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed with N-EtFOSA to examine the bioaccumulation, elimination and metabolism of N-EtFOSA by the earthworms after in vivo and in vitro exposure. N-EtFOSA could be biodegraded in quartz sands to perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and PFOS. In the in vivo tests, in addition to parent N-EtFOSA, three metabolites, including perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetate (FOSAA), FOSA and PFOS also accumulated in earthworms as a result of N-EtFOSA biotransformation, with FOSA as the predominant metabolite. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and uptake rate coefficient (ku) of N-EtFOSA from sand were 20.4 and 2.41·d−1, respectively. The elimination rate constants (ke) decreased in the order FOSAA (0.130·d−1) > N-EtFOSA (0.118·d−1) > FOSA (0.073·d−1) > PFOS (0.051·d−1). The biotransformation of N-EtFOSA in earthworm was further confirmed by the in vitro test involving incubation of earthworm homogenates with N-EtFOSA. This work provides evidence on the accumulation and transformation of N-EtFOSA in terrestrial invertebrates and will be helpful to explore the indirect sources of FOSA and PFOS in environmental biota.

Particular attention is being paid to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) because of their persistence and bioaccumulation, especially in the aquatic environment. In this paper, we present results of a study aimed at evaluating the effects of different perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) concentrations (2, 20 and 200 μg/L) on morpho-physiological traits in Lemna minor L. plants. The accumulation of PFOA in the plant's tissues was also monitored. L. minor was selected as a model plant for ecotoxicological studies, and we performed a seven-day assay for this investigation. The results highlight the lack of inhibitory effects on biometric parameters such as mean frond area, total frond number, multiplication rate, doubling time of frond number and average specific growth rate, for each of tested PFOA concentrations. Also, at photosynthetic level, physiological measurements showed that chlorophyll content and electron transport rate (ETR) were not affected by the exposure to PFOA. Remarkably, the chlorophyll fluorescence images, used for the first time in a study on PFOA, evidenced no impairment to the photosynthetic efficiency, measured by the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (Fv/Fm), the quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (ΦPSII) and the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) over the leaf surface of PFOA-treated plants, in comparison to control. Quantification of PFOA in the growth medium at the end of the seven-day test revealed no statistically different concentrations in plates with or without L. minor plants. We detected increasing PFOA accumulation in plant tissues, in accordance with the PFOA concentrations in the medium. Therefore, the L. minor plants were capable of taking up and accumulating PFOA.

The paper aims to compare the effects on mouse liver organoids (target organ for bioaccumulation) of two long-chain PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate-PFOS-, perfluorooctanoic acid-PFOA) and two short-chain PFAS commonly utilized in the industry (heptafluorobutyric acid-HFBA-, Pentafluoropropionic anhydride-PFPA) to identify the mode of action of these classes of contaminants. Cytomorphological aberrations and ALT/GDH enzyme disruption were identified but no acute toxicity endpoint neither apoptosis was detected by the two tested short-chain PFAS. After cytomorphological analysis, it is evident that short-chain PFAS affected organoid morphology inducing a reduction of cytostructural complexity and aberrant cytological features. Conversely, EC50 values of 670 ± 30 µM and 895 ± 7 µM were measured for PFOS and PFOA, respectively, together with strong ALT/GDH enzyme disruption, caspase 3 and 7 apoptosis activation and deep loss of architectural complexity of organoids in the range of 500–1000 µM. Eventually, biochemical markers and histology analysis confirmed the sensitivity of organoid tests that could be used as a fast and reproducible platform to test many PFAS and mixtures saving time and at low cost in comparison with in vivo tests. Organoids testing could be introduced as an innovative platform to assess the toxicity to fast recognize potentially dangerous pollutants. © 2022 by the authors.

The bullfrog is a highly nutritious and edible aquatic product, but the PFAS accumulation characteristics of bullfrogs had not been paid attention. The present study analyzed the PFAS concentrations in different tissues of cultured bullfrogs and relevant water and sediments collected from the aquaculture region in the coastal area of South China. Results showed that total PFAS concentrations were 50.26-364.25 ng/L in water, with a mean of 135.58 ng/L; concentrations in effluent water were significantly higher than those in influent water, which means bullfrog farming could increase contaminants into the surroundings. The total PFAS concentrations varied from 2.89 to 162.26 ng/g center dot dw in sediment. The distribution profile of PFASs in sediment was similar to that of water, with short chain playing a significant role. Total PFASs in bullfrog tissues were 3.36-84.07 ng/g center dot dw, with the highest values in the digestive system (intestines and stomach).

Carbon -related materials may act as co -catalysts, enhancing the pollutants adsorption on the surface, improving the charge carriers separation and photocatalyst stability and providing more active centres for photocatalytic reactions. This review summarizes recent advances in the preparation and environmental application of carbon -related materials. The focus was set on preparation of carbon -related materials and magnetic carbon -related photocatalytic materials with the property of easy separation after the purification process in an external magnetic field and their application for degradation of emerging pollutants not susceptible to biodegradation. The present studies identify four main groups of water pollutants: pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and heavy metals. Among them, pharmaceuticals and phenolic compounds represent a significant group of persistent organic pollutants. Some of the commonly used pharmaceuticals for human health, as well as disinfectants, are found in wastewater influents and effluents (after the purification process) almost in the unchanged form. Their detection in trace amounts (of about a few micrograms to hundreds of nanograms per litre) and removal become difficult but important because they put at risk the reuse of treated wastewater and the sustainability of water cycle management. Concerning levels of concentrations, these compounds are classified as hazardous due to possibilities of bioaccumulation, biomagnification and toxic impact on living organisms, even in trace amounts. Up to now, various methods have been reported in the removal of pharmaceuticals and phenolic compounds from aqueous systems. Heterogeneous photocatalysis belonging to the group of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is one of the most promising methods used for the degradation of emerging pollutants. Introducing carbon -related materials modified by magnetic ferrites can significantly improve the efficiency of emerging contaminants' degradation. This review provides coherent information for future studies in the application of carbon -related materials and magnetic carbon -related materials for the removal of active pharmaceutical ingredients and phenolic compounds. Insights on pharmaceutical and phenolic compounds photodegradation in the presence of carbon -based materials combined with magnetic ferrites and their combination with SR-(AOPs) and Fenton type photocatalysis are for the first time discussed. Moreover, the effect of various parameters such as water matrice, pH, natural organic matter presence, and temperature were also discussed.

The results showed that the steady-state body burden (Cb-ss) of PFAS in pelagic organisms increased with increasing temperatures, mainly attributed to increased water concentrations. The uptake rate constant (ku) and elimination rate constant (ke) in pelagic organisms increased with increasing temperature. In contrast, warming did not significantly change or even mitigate Cb-ss of PFAS in the benthic organism Chironomus plumosus, except for PFPeA and PFHpA, which was consistent with declined sediment concentrations. The mitigation could be explained by the decreased bioaccumulation factor due to a more significant percent increase in ke than ku, especially for long-chain PFAS.

Cells in deeper sediment layers are oxidizing sulfide, while cells in the surface layers of the sediment are reducing oxygen. The electrical coupling of these two redox half reactions is ensured via long-distance electron transport through a network of conductive fibers that run in the shared cell envelope of the centimeter-long filament. Here we investigate how this unique electrogenic metabolism is linked to filament growth and cell division. Combining dual-label stable isotope probing (C-13 and N-15), nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry, fluorescence microscopy and genome analysis, we find that the cell cycle of cable bacteria cells is highly comparable to that of other, single-celled Gram-negative bacteria. However, the timing of cell growth and division appears to be tightly and uniquely controlled by long-distance electron transport, as cell division within an individual filament shows a remarkable synchronicity that extends over a millimeter length scale. To explain this, we propose the ""oxygen pacemaker"" model in which a filament only grows when performing long-distance transport, and the latter is only possible when a filament has access to oxygen so it can discharge electrons from its internal electrical network.",NA,10.3389/fmicb.2021.620807,Cell Cycle,NA,NA

Samples were analyzed from fifteen collection years including 1990 and all years from 1997 to 2010, and from seven colonies located throughout the Great Lakes, ranging from remote to highly urbanized areas. Other than at the Toronto Harbour colony, the slopes of Sigma PFSA concentrations (C-6, C-8, and C-10) versus time were negative indicating general declines between 1990 and 2010. PFOS was the dominant PFSA regardless of colony or year, ranging from 80 to 99% of Sigma PFSA. For Sigma PFCA (C-8-C-15), slopes of concentrations versus time were generally positive with 4 of 7 colonies showing statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in levels through time. Individual PFCAs showed similar increasing trends except for PFOA. Regardless of colony, the PFCA pattern was dominated by the C-10 to C-13 PFCAs. Consistent with the PFOS declines, concentrations of the PFOS precursor, PFOSA, declined at most colonies between 1990 and 2006 and post-2006 concentrations were below detection limits. Declining concentrations of the C-8 PFCs, PFOS, PFOA and PFOSA, were consistent with the phase out in 2002 by the 3M Company in North America of all of C-8 PFC-related chemistry products. Increasing production volumes of fluorotelomer based compounds, and degradation of these compounds to PFCAs may explain increasing trends of PFCAs in gull eggs.

In this study, we compared exposures and load contributions to surface water from the discharge of three reuse waters (wastewater effluent, urban stormwater, and agricultural runoff). Results document substantial and varying organic-chemical contribution to surface water from effluent discharges (e.g., disinfection byproducts [DBP], prescription pharmaceuticals, industrial/household chemicals), urban stormwater (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, nonprescription pharmaceuticals), and agricultural runoff (e.g., pesticides). Excluding DBPs, episodic storm-event organic concentrations and loads from urban stormwater were comparable to and often exceeded those of daily wastewater-effluent discharges. We also assessed if wastewater-effluent irrigation to corn resulted in measurable effects on organic-chemical concentrations in rain-induced agricultural runoff and harvested feedstock. Overall, the target-organic load of 491 g from wastewater-effluent irrigation to the study corn field during the 2019 growing season did not produce substantial dissolved organic-contaminant contributions in subsequent rain-induced runoff events.

This report describes a method for the analysis of melamine in porcine muscle tissue using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ MS/MS). Melamine was extracted in 50% acetonitrile in water. Homogenates were centrifuged and supernatants were acidified and washed with methylene chloride. The aqueous extracts were cleaned up using mixed-mode C8/strong cation exchange SPE and then concentrated, fortified with a stable isotope-labeled analog of melamine, and analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS. Gradient HPLC separation was performed using an ether-linked phenyl column with ammonium acetate/acetic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode of two precursor-product ion transitions for melamine and one for the internal standard was used. A five point calibration curve ranging from 50 to 2000 ng/mL of melamine in solvent was used to establish instrument response. The method was validated by analysis of seven replicate porcine muscle tissue samples fortified with 10 ng/g of melamine.

Previous studies have identified these processes and compared the Hg redox chemistry between water types but have been hampered by errors associated primarily with the type of reaction vessels utilized, and the inability of the methods to simultaneously measure oxidation and reduction. Presented here are the results of experiments which demonstrate the validity of a new method that addresses both these issues through the design and use of a new reaction vessel, a 5 L PFA Teflon (R) incubation bag, and by the addition of isotopically labeled inorganic Hg species (both Hg-II and Hg-0). The method development showed that turn thick FEP Teflon (R) is permeable to Hg-0, and therefore unsuitable. Application of this method showed that both oxidation and reduction occurred simultaneously in natural waters exposed to ambient sunlight and that the rate of these transformations were of similar order (10(-3) to 10(-4) s(-1)). Given such reaction rates, the characteristic time to equilibrium is rapid, on the order of hours. The method is applicable for tracer studies, and the method was able to quantify rate constants of greater than 10(-5) s(-1). Overall, this study suggests that the rates of reaction are faster than previously predicted primarily because previous studies did not account for the fact that both reactions are occurring simultaneously in natural waters.

The widespread use in bulk quantities of halogenated organic chemicals (HOCs; also called Organohalogens), including chlorinated, brominated, and fluorinated compounds, and their persistent nature have resulted in global environmental contamination. Increasing levels of HOCs in environmental media (i.e., air, water, soil, sediment) and in human tissues including adipose tissue, breast milk, and placenta continue to be a cause of ecological and human health concern. Human exposure can occur through multiple pathways including direct skin contact, inhalation, drinking water, and mainly through food consumption. HOCs exposure has been implicated in a myriad of health effects including reproductive, neurological, immunological, endocrine, behavioral, and carcinogenic effects in both wildlife and humans. In addition, recent studies indicate that exposure to HOCs contributes to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Because of these adverse health effects, several regulatory agencies either banned or placed severe restrictions on their production and usage. In turn, many industries withdrew from production and usage of HOCs. This action resulted in decline of older HOCs such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), but more recent HOCs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) show a steady increase/stable with time in the global environment. Based on their use pattern and their persistent chemical properties, human exposure to HOCs will likely continue.

In the present study, temporal trends of contaminants were analyzed in eggs sampled in four regions along the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) and inland sites using new and previously published data. Most contaminants declined significantly over time in most regions. Globally, the highest annual change, - 17.5%, was found for pp'-DDD, while the smallest annual decline, -0.54%, was observed for Hg. Concentrations of Sigma DDT and Sigma FR8 (sum of 8 congeners) decreased by -11.6% and -7.3%, respectively. Declines in Sigma PCBs differed among regions, from-5.6% in the fluvial section to-14.7% in the inland region. The highest concentration of Sigma FR8 was measured in eggs from Grande Ile in the fluvial section of the river in 1996 (2.39 mu g/g). Stable isotope ratios also showed temporal trends in some regions: delta C-13 decreased in the fluvial section and increased in Gulf region, while delta N-15 decreased in the fluvial section and increased in the upper estuary. Significant positive relationships were found between Sigma DDT, Sigma PCBs and Sigma FRs and delta N-15 and delta C-13 in freshwater colonies, but not in estuarine or marine colonies. These results suggest that changes in trophic level and foraging areas over time were influential factors with respect to contaminant burden in great blue heron eggs in the fluvial section, but not in the other regions.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) belongs to this group of compounds and it is also the product of degradation of many FOCs. This xenobiotic is extremely persistent in the environment. For the general population, the major routes of exposure to PFOS are the dietary intake, inhalation and dermal contact. PFOS is mainly absorbed orally, it is transported in blood bound to albumin and it is able to cross the placenta and the blood brain barrier. The liver is the main target organ. Besides hepatotoxic and metabolic effects observed after this xenobiotic exposure, different receptors such as peroxisome proliferator activators or PPAR are also involved in their toxicity mechanisms. In addition, PFOS is immunotoxic, by modifying cytokine secretion, cell differentiation of monocytes, lymphocytes, etc. and the activity of natural killer cells. Furthermore, PFOS is neurotoxic at both central and peripheral levels, and it induces significant neuroendocrinological alterations in several organs and tissues of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes. © 2012, Asociacion Espanola de Toxicologia.

We observed significant temporal trends of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (∑PFCAs) in all three subpopulations. Concentrations of FOSA and PFOS had started decreasing significantly since the mid-1990s to 2000 in the Greenland and Norwegian subpopulations, consistent with the 3M phase-out, though in sharp contrast to overall increasing trends observed in the Swedish subpopulation. Moreover, ∑PFCA concentrations significantly increased in all three subpopulations throughout the study periods. These temporal trends suggest on-going input of PFOS in the Baltic and of ∑PFCAs in all three regions. Considerable spatial variation in PFAS concentrations and profiles was observed: PFOS concentrations were significantly higher in Sweden, whereas FOSA and ∑PFCA concentrations were similar among the subpopulations. PFOS dominated the PFAS profiles in the Swedish and Norwegian subpopulations, in contrast to the domination of FOSA and ∑PFCAs in the Greenland one. Our spatiotemporal observations underline the usefulness of archived bird of prey feathers in monitoring spatiotemporal PFAS trends and urge for continued monitoring efforts in each of the studied subpopulations.

Potential associations between various variables of the reproductive system and fat concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) and other organochlorine pesticides and liver concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were investigated using multiple regression models. The anogenital distance was negatively associated (p<. 0.05) with concentration of p,p'-DDE and some PFAAs (perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) and ∑PFAA). Penis length was positively associated with PCB 28, PCB 47/48, PCB 52 and PCB 110 (p<0.05), and some of these congeners were also associated with baculum length and penis weight. In contrast, penile length tended (p<. 0.1) to be shorter in mink with high concentrations of p,p'-DDE. These data may help to improve the understanding of how environmental pollution affects male reproduction in both wildlife and humans. Overall, the study suggests endocrine disrupting effects in wild mink and identifies potentially important pollutants in the complex mixture of contaminants in the environment.

In addition, the partition behaviors of PFAS in the water-SPM system and water-sediment system and the potential sources of PFAS in the marine environment were revealed. The total concentrations of PFAS (∑PFAS) in the water-dissolved phase, surface sediment and SPM were 20.5–684 ng/L, 2.69–25.0 ng/g dry weight (dw) and 4.39–527 ng/g dw, respectively. The level of PFAS contamination in the coastal areas of Shandong Province was higher than that in other areas. The average partition coefficients (log Kd) of PFAS in the water-SPM system and water-sediment system were 1.56–3.57 and 0.72–2.95, respectively. Long-chain PFAS and PFECHS (perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate) have a higher log Kd than that of short-chain PFAS. PFAS with short carbon chains were mainly detected in the water-dissolved phase, but long-chain PFAS mainly occurred in the surface sediment and SPM phases. Source analysis based on the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model found that erosion inhibitor factories, aqueous film-forming foam factories, metal plating plants, fluoropolymer chemical manufacture and food contact materials were the main sources of PFAS in Bohai Bay.

The chronic effects of nominal exposure to 3 mu g/L of fullerenes (C-60) and 1 mu g/L of triclosan (TCS) alone and in a binary mixture, were evaluated using the freshwater snail Radix balthica. Pollutants accumulation, reproductive output and feeding behavior were selected as sublethal endpoints. After 21 days of exposure, we did not observe interactive effects between TCS and C-60 on the studied endpoints, except for the accumulation of C-60 in R. balthica in TCS + C-60 treatment, which was lower than when the fullerenes were alone. Neither TCS nor C-60 caused significant effects on reproduction, expressed as number of eggs per individual, but an increase in the clutch size was observed in treatments with TCS at the third week of exposure, independently of the presence of C-60 (16.15 +/- 1.67 and 18.9 +/- 4.01 eggs/egg mass in TCS and TCS + C-60 treatments, respectively, vs. 13.17 +/- 4.01 in control). The presence of C50 significantly enhanced the grazing activity of R. balthica during the first seven days (4.95 +/- 1.35 and 3.91 +/- 0.59% of the area grazed per individual in C-60 and TCS + C-60 treatments, respectively, vs 2.6 +/- 0.39% in control). The accumulation of TCS was quite similar in treatments where this pollutant was present (BAF = 1007 L/kg d.w.); however, the accumulation of C-60 was higher when the nanoparticles were alone (BAF = 254.88 L/kg d.w.) than when it was in the binary mixture (BAF = 7.79 L/kg d.w). Overall, although TCS has been listed as an endocrine disrupter compound, no significant effects on reproduction were observed in the assayed conditions.

In general, contaminants were present at relatively low concentrations. For example, for biosolids and compost-like-output (CLO), concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were approximately 1-10 and 5-50 times lower, respectively, than various proposed or implemented European limit values for these contaminants in biosolids or composts applied to agricultural land. However, the technical basis for these limits may require re-evaluation in some cases. Polybrominated, and mixed halogenated, dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans are not currently considered in risk assessments of dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals, but were detected at relatively high concentrations compared with PCDD/Fs in the biosolids and CLOs and their potential contribution to the overall toxic equivalency is assessed. Other emerging' contaminants, such as organophosphate flame retardants, were detected in several of the waste materials, and their potential significance is discussed.

The concentrations of legacy PFAS –PFOA and PFOS, shows resemblance with global data, however, elevated concentrations of long chain C9 – C14 PFAS were observed in this study. Though, higher concentrations of PFAS were measured in full cream dairy milk, no statistical significant difference (P = 0.546) was observed for the various classes of dairy milk. The EDI of Σ15PFAS through infant formulas were 184.92, 329.47 and 166 ngkg−1BWday−1 for partially breastfed, exclusively formula fed and older infants, respectively. Similarly, the EDI of PFAS through dairy milk for toddlers, adolescents, female and male adults for the rural population were 14.17, 1.09, 2.59 and 3.16 ngkg−1BWday−1 respectively while they were 20.41, 3.84, 4.13 and 4.26 ngkg−1BWday−1 respectively in the urban population. Although, the EDI of PFAS through the consumption of infant formulas and dairy milk are lower than the daily tolerable limits, the relative importance of long-term exposure and the cumulative effects of multiple exposure pathways cannot be overemphasized. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142697,PFAS;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;Animals;Article;Adolescent;Eating;South Africa;Human;Milk;Infant;Child;animal;concentration (parameter);female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;unclassified drug;controlled study;dietary intake;food contamination;persistent organic pollutant;alkyl group;chemistry;perfluoro compound;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;perfluorodecanoic acid;perfluorododecanoic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluorotridecanoic acid;perfluoroundecanoic acid;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;high performance liquid chromatography;perfluorohexanoic acid;risk assessment;Emerging contaminant;human;milk;Adult;child;dietary exposure;infant;preschool child;adolescent;priority journal;perfluorononanoic acid;perfluoroheptanoic acid;perfluorotetradecanoic acid;limit of quantitation;limit of detection;perfluorobutanoic acid;prevalence;perfluoroalkyl;breast milk;Dairies;validation process;eating;Tandem mass spectrometric;Elevated concentrations;long term exposure;Preschool;breast feeding;artificial milk;measurement precision;polyfluoroalkyl;rural population;Ultra-high performance liquid chromatographies;urban population;Cumulative effects;Dairy milk;Detection frequency;dietary reference intake;EDI;Infant formula;Infant Formula;Long term exposure;perfluorobutanosulfate;perfluorodecanosulfate;perfluorohexanosulfate;perfluorooctanosulfonate;perfluoropeptanoic acid;retailing;Humanities;Humanism;Milk Ejection,NA,NA

Such concerns have necessitated the development of reliable methods for rapid determination of perfluoroalkyl substances in human serum. This article describes a rapid and sensitive analytical method suitable for monitoring human exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances. Abstract A method for the analysis of 13 perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) in human serum was developed based on hybrid solid-phase extraction (hybrid-SPE) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Serum PFASs were extracted using hybrid-SPE-phospholipid cartridge after precipitating proteins and other endogenous biological interferences with 1 % ammonium formate in methanol. The average intra-day accuracy (measured as percent recoveries from fortified samples) and precision of the method (measured as relative standard deviation [RSD, %] between analyses) were 88.7-117 % and 1.0-13.4 %, respectively. The average inter-day precision was 2.8-6.9 %. The method was sensitive, with limits of quantification (LOQs) in the range of 0.05 to 0.09 ng mL -1 for all 13 PFASs. The applicability of this method was tested by analysing serum-certified standard reference material and proficiency test samples. In an hour, 100 samples can be processed by hybrid-SPE, and the instrumental run time is 5 min per sample. The developed method is rapid, inexpensive, accurate, precise, and extremely sensitive for the analysis of PFASs in human serum. © CSIRO.",NA,10.1071/EN17192,PFOS;biomonitoring;lipid;pollution exposure;liquid chromatography;mass spectrometry;serum;UPLC;extraction method;methanol;toxic substance;analytical method;ammonium;children's exposure;MS/MS;precision,NA,NA

A single run liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for these molecules can be an alternative to this time-consuming technique. The first step of this development is the infusion study of the fragmentation of 79 molecules of biological interest in electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), in positive and in negative ionisation mode. Among them, three molecules can be detected only in negative ionisation mode, 38 only in positive mode and 38 in the two modes. All the most abundant fragmentations are presented, with optimisation of the MS/MS parameters. The positive ionisation mode was retained for the simultaneous analysis of 76 molecules. One sensitive and/or specific transition is proposed for the monitoring of each molecule. Improvement in sensitivity of detection was obtained with the use of an acidic mobile phase. Flow injection analysis studies led us to highlight a number of interferences-due to isobaric molecules, to in-source collision-induced dissociation, or to natural isotopic distribution of the elements-which are listed. For a reliable quantification method, these molecules have to be separated by LC before analysis in the tandem mass spectrometer. Ion-pairing reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) using perfluorinated carboxylic acids as ion-pairing agents has already been found suitable for analysis of AA in MS/MS positive ionisation mode and is under development.

In particular, fetuses are sensitive to xenobiotics and the placenta functions as a significant barrier for environmental pollutants. The placental transfer of PFAS is closely related to their interactions with proteins. In this study, 54 human placental samples were collected to investigate the occurrence of legacy and emerging PFAS in human placenta, including perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs), chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs), and fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTSAs). Among the legacy PFAS, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were detected in all samples, with PFOS and PFOA being the two predominant (mean: 0.457 and 0.242 ng/g wet weight, respectively). Among the emerging PFAS, 6:2 Cl-PFESA was detected in all samples with the mean value of 0.104 ng/g wet weight, while the detect frequency (DF) of 8:2 Cl-PFESAs was only 24%. The concentration and DF of the four FTSA congeners were low in the placentas. Molecular docking calculation results showed that the binding affinities of PFAS to the human serum albumin (HSA) were increased with chain length in each category except for the PFCAs, of which the perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) was the turning point of binding affinity to HSA. For PFSAs, their binding affinities to organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4) were increased with the chain length except for the sodium perfluoro-1-heptanesulfonate (PFHpS) and sodium perfluoro-1-nonanesulfonate (PFNS). The calculation results demonstrated that the placental transfer of PFAS is closely related to chain length. The findings in the study can help better understand the occurrence of the PFAS in the human placenta and the placental transfer mechanisms of PFAS in human beings. © 2021; The main congeners of PFAS in human placentas were legacy PFAS.

Then, based on the testing of growth inhibition, cytotoxicity, photosynthesis and oxidative stress, and the toxicity mechanism of PFAS mixture (Perfluorobutane sulfonate and Perfluorobutane sulfonamide) to algae was explored using the Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The results revealed that all three emerging PFAS treatments had a certain growth inhibitory effect on Chlorella pyrenoidosa (C. pyrenoidosa), but the toxicity of PFAS mixture was stronger than that of individual PFAS and showed a significant synergistic effect at environmental concentration. The joint toxicity mechanisms of binary PFAS mixture to C. pyrenoidosa were related to the damage of photosynthetic system, obstruction of ROS metabolism, and inhibition of DNA replication.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as the primary source of micro and nanoplastic contamination, necessitating the development of effective removal methods. This study investigates the efficacy of electrolysis-assisted flotation (EF) process for removing nanoplastics from synthetic wastewater, using polystyrene-type nanoparticles synthesized from expanded polystyrene waste (EPS) as representative nanoplastic contaminants. Electrolysis experiments were conducted using parallel aluminium electrodes under low-voltage conditions. The study systematically explores the influence of various process parameters, including electrode spacing, salt concentration, nanoplastics concentration, and applied voltage, on the removal efficiency of nanoplastics. The removal efficiency was evaluated using a turbidity meter and dynamic light scattering technique. The derived count rate (DCR) obtained from dynamic light scattering supplements the nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) and provides a reliable estimate of the nanoplastics sample concentration. Under optimized conditions, with a specified electrolyte concentration and pH of 7.2 +/- 0.3, the EF process achieved an impressive removal efficiency of nearly 95 % (94 % per DCR). A notable advantage of the proposed method is forming a foamy layer on top of the reactor when nanoplastics and coagulants are mixed, facilitating easy removal by simple scraping. This study provides valuable insights into developing an eco-friendly and sustainable approach for the large-scale removal of nanoplastics. The results contribute to advancing wastewater treatment strategies and addressing the pressing issue of nanoplastic pollution. (c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One lake, NOW5, was in the vicinity of a little auk (Alle alle L.) bird colony, whereas the other two lakes, NOW14 and Q5, were undisturbed by seabirds. The former was strongly acidic (pH = 3.4) but the latter had a pH close to 8. Due to the guano loading, NOW5 exhibited higher chlorophyll concentrations (74 mu g/L) than the other two lakes (1.6-3.4 mu g/L), higher content of total phosphorous (0.34 mg/L vs. 0.007-0.01 mg/L) and total nitrogen (3.75 mg/L vs. 0.21-0.75 mg/L).The concentrations of all organohalogen compounds were substantially greater in NOW5 than in the other lakes, indicating the strong influence of these seabirds in the transport and deposition of these compounds to remote sites. However, not all compounds showed the same increases. Hexachlorocyclohexanes and endosulfans were more than 18 times higher in NOW5, the drin pesticides and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), between 9.5 and 18 times and DDTs, polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and chlordanes about 2.7-6 times. These differences demonstrated that the bird-mediated deposition has preservation effects of the less stable and more volatile compounds, e.g. those with log Kaw < -2.4, log Koa < 9 and/or log Kow < 6.8.The sedimentary fluxes of PCBs, HCHs, drins, chlordanes, PBDEs, HCB and endosulfans were highest in the upper sediment layer of the polynya lake (year 2014). In contrast, the highest DDT fluxes were found in 1980.

Organic (dissolved and particulate, delta N-15 and delta C-13) and inorganic (nitrate and ammonium, delta N-15 and delta O-18) N forms were measured over the salinity gradient in the wet and dry season in subtropical estuaries receiving increasing terrestrial N loads (pristine: 16 kg N d(-1), moderate: 150 kg N d(-1), degraded: 630 kg N d(-1)).

Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) comprise a large group of chemicals that have been produced for about 50 years. This chapter discusses the reproductive and developmental toxicity of these compounds. PFCs are fully fluorinated chemicals, which are synthetic with unique properties and have been recognized as a class of emerging, persistent contaminants. Perfluorinated sulfonates, PFOS, and PFCAs, such as PFOA are not reactive, resist hydrolysis and photolysis, and are not easily degraded in biological systems, making them persistent in the environment. The most recent findings suggest that infants and toddlers are at high risk due to the combined exposure from lactation, dust and particle ingestion and inhalation. Furthermore, it is important to characterize vulnerable and sensitive periods during the organism's life-course, as well as the most vulnerable and sensitive endpoints of toxicity. According to what is known at the moment, it looks as though neurotoxicological endpoints, including behavior and molecular disturbances in the brain, are very sensitive and are induced at the lowest doses, compared to induction of toxicity in other organs or systems, especially when looking at exposure during the neonatal period, a period also coinciding with the highest exposure in the general population. Finally, there is no doubt that PFOS and PFOA can induce reproductive and developmental toxic effects in various organs and tissues. Therefore, effects of PFOS and PFOA in combination and/or in combination with other xenobiotics need to be investigated. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, the understanding of PFAS impacts on this species and other aquatic organisms is still very limited, especially at the host–gut microbiome molecular interaction level. To this end, the present study aimed to apply these leading-edge omics technologies within an integrated framework that provides biological insight into the host turtle–turtle gut microbiome interactions of PFAS-impacted wild-caught freshwater turtles. For this purpose, faecal samples from PFAS-impacted turtles (n = 5) and suitable PFAS-free reference turtles (n = 5) were collected and analysed. Data from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolomic profiling of the turtle faeces were integrated using MetOrigin to assign host, microbiome, and co-metabolism activities. Significant variation in microbial composition was observed between the two turtle groups. The PFAS-impacted turtles showed a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and a lower relative abundance of Bacteroidota than the reference turtles. The faecal metabolome showed several metabolites and pathways significantly affected by PFAS exposure. Turtles exposed to PFAS displayed altered amino acid and butanoate metabolisms, as well as altered purine and pyrimidine metabolism.

A proteomics-informed comparison of the effects of polystyrene beads of different sizes on macrophages,2022,8,11,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO,"[""2051-8153"", ""2051-8161""]",9,8,2827-2840,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plastics are one of the most preoccupying emerging pollutants. Macroplastics released into the environment degrade into microplastics and nanoplastics. Because of their small size, these micro and nano plastic particles can enter the food chain and, in addition to their ecotoxicological effects, contaminate humans with still unknown biological effects. Plastics being particulate pollutants, they are handled in the human body by scavenger cells such as macrophages, which are important players in the immune system. In order to get a better appraisal of the effects of plastic particles on macrophages, we have studied the effects of unmodified polystyrene particles of 0.1, 1 and 10 micrometers of diameter, by a combination of proteomics and targeted validation experiments. Proteomics showed important adaptive changes of the proteome in response to exposure to plastics, with more than one third of the detected proteins showing a significance change in their abundance in response to cell exposure to at least one plastic bead size. These changes affected for example mitochondrial, lysosomal or cytoskeletal proteins. Although an increase in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was detected in response to 10 micrometer beads, no alteration in cell viability was observed. Similarly, no lysosomal dysfunction and no alteration in the phagocytic capability of the cells was observed in response to exposure to plastics. When the inflammatory response was examined, no increase in the secretion of tumor necrosis factor or interleukin 6 was observed. Oppositely, the secretion of these cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide was observed after exposure to plastics, which suggested a decreased ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial infection. In conclusion, these results provide a better understanding of the responses of macrophages to exposure to polystyrene particles of different sizes.",NA,10.1039/d2en00214k,Macrophages;Proteome;Proteomics,NA,NA

Although some medicines and functional food ingredients are currently being used to alleviate the biological toxicity effects caused by PFOA, these candidates all show potential side effects and cannot prevent the accumulation of PFOA in the body, making them unable to be used as a daily dietary supplement to relieve the toxic effects of PFOA. However, new research has shown that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can alleviate toxicity caused by exposure to foreign substances. In this study, multiple strains of LAB with different adsorption capacities or antioxidant capacities were used to analyse their mitigation effects of on liver damage caused by PFOA exposure. The results showed that the adsorption capacity and antioxidant capacity of LAB could alleviate the liver toxicity of PFOA to a certain extent. Moreover, treatment with some strains of LAB was able to recover the gut microbiota dysbiosis caused by PFOA exposure, such as by increasing the relative abundances of Patescibacteria, Proteobacteria, Akkermansia and Alistipes or decreasing the abundances of Bacteroides and Blautia. In addition, a strain with neither outstanding antioxidant capacity nor adsorption capacity also reversed the decline in short-chain fatty acid levels caused by PFOA exposure. The ability of these strains to relieve gut microbiota dysbiosis partly explains the inconsistency between the capacity for antioxidant or PFOA adsorption and the ability of the strains to alleviate PFOA toxicity. The results indicate that the PFOA adsorption capacity and antioxidant capacity of LAB may be involved in the alleviation of PFOA liver toxicity. In addition, LAB could also alleviate liver damage caused by PFOA by adjusting the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acid content. Therefore, some strains of LAB can be used as a potentially safe dietary supplement to relieve PFOA-induced liver damage. © 2021 The Authors",NA,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112515,Fluorocarbons;Antioxidants;Article;Liver;Adsorption;fluorocarbon;nonhuman;animal experiment;pollutant;mouse;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;oxidative stress;RNA 16S;liver;mass spectrometry;gas chromatography;human;mass fragmentography;octanoic acid;endocrine disruptor;animal model;enzyme linked immunosorbent assay;interleukin 4;glutathione;Caprylates;intestine flora;experimental study;physiological response;antineoplastic activity;aspartate aminotransferase;oxidation;malonaldehyde;alanine aminotransferase;environmental factor;hepatomegaly;liver injury;antioxidant;interleukin 6;phylogenetic tree;taxonomy;antioxidant activity;Gastrointestinal Microbiome;Microbiota;pyrosequencing;microbial community;sorption;laboratory method;Gut microbiota;Proteobacteria;soil microflora;microbial diversity;Akkermansia;Alistipes;Anti-oxidation;Bacteroides;biosorption;dysbiosis;lactic acid;Lactic acid bacteria;lactic acid bacterium;Lactobacillales;Liver damage;short chain fatty acid;Lactic Acid;Bacteria,NA,NA

In order to counteract the large knowledge gap regarding PFAS in German drinking water, 89 drinking water samples from all over Germany were collected with the help of residents and were analyzed for 26 PFAS by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The 20 PFAS recently regulated by sum concentration (PFAS∑20), as well as six other PFAS, were quantified by targeted analysis. In all drinking water samples, PFAS∑20 was below the limit of 0.1 μg/L, but the sum concentrations ranged widely from below the limit of quantification up to 80.2 ng/L. The sum concentrations (PFAS∑4) of perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and perfluorononanoate of 20 ng/L were exceeded in two samples. The most frequently detected individual substances were PFOS (in 52% of the samples), perfluorobutanesulfonate (52%), perfluorohexanoate (PFHxA) (44%), perfluoropentanoate (43%) and PFHxS (35%). The highest single concentrations were 23.5 ng/L for PFHxS, 15.3 ng/L for PFOS, and 10.1 ng/L for PFHxA.

Multiple scientific studies of polar bears indicate negative relationships between exposure to these contaminants and health parameters; however, these are all of a correlative nature and do not represent true cause-and-effects. Therefore, information from controlled studies of farmed Norwegian Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and housed East and West Greenland sledge dogs (Canis familiaris) were included as supportive weight of evidence in the clarification of contaminant exposure and health effects in polar bears. The review showed that hormone and vitamin concentrations, liver, kidney and thyroid gland morphology as well as reproductive and immune systems of polar bears are likely to be influenced by contaminant exposure. Furthermore, exclusively based on polar bear contaminant studies, bone density reduction and neurochemical disruption and DNA hypomethylation of the brain stem seemed to occur. The range of tissue concentration, at which these alterations were observed in polar bears, were ca. 1–70,000ng/g lw for OCs (blood plasma concentrations of some PCB metabolites even higher), ca. 1–1000ng/g lw for PBDEs and for PFCs and Hg 114–3052ng/g ww and 0.1–50μg/g ww, respectively. Similar concentrations were found in farmed foxes and housed sledge dogs while the lack of dose response designs did not allow an estimation of threshold levels for oral exposure and accumulated tissue concentrations. Nor was it possible to pinpoint a specific group of contaminants being more important than others nor analyze their interactions. For East Greenland polar bears the corresponding daily ΣOC and ΣPBDE oral exposure was estimated to be 35 and 0.34μg/kg body weight, respectively. Furthermore, PFC concentrations, at which population effect levels could occur, are likely to be reached around year 2012 for the East Greenland polar bear subpopulation if current increasing temporal trends continue. Such proposed reproductive population effects were supported by physiological based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling of critical body residues (CBR) with risk quotients ≥1 for ΣPCB, dieldrin, ΣPFC and ΣOHC (organohalogen contaminant). The estimated daily TEQ for East Greenland polar bears and East Greenland sledge dogs were 32–281-folds above WHO ΣTEQ guidelines for humans. Compared to human tolerable daily intake (TDI), these were exceeded for PCBs, dieldrin, chlordanes and ΣHCH in East Greenland polar bears. Comparisons like these should be done with caution, but together with the CBR modelling and T-score estimations, these were the only available tools for polar bear risk evaluation. In conclusion, polar bears seem to be susceptible to contaminant induced stress that may have an overall sub-clinical impact on their health and population status via impacts on their immune and reproductive systems.",NA,10.1016/j.envint.2010.03.002,Prednisolone;Climate change;Environmental toxicology;Health risk assessment;Endocrine disruptors;Polar bear;the environment;Bone density;Organochlorine compounds &amp;Pesticide toxicology;Predatory animals,NA,NA

We found the ubiquity of PFAAs in all types of samples, including those from confined aquifers (2.7–6.8 ng/L). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were the major PFAAs in all samples, accounting for an average of 49.1% (0.8–84.8%) and 33.3% (6.3–92.2%) of total PFAAs, respectively.

Short-chain perfluoropentanoic acid accounted for an average of 10.3% (1.9–24.6%) of total PFAAs in rivers and coastal waters. Branched isomers of both PFOA and PFOS were detected in most samples (36/42 and 39/42, respectively). One-way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference in the profiles of PFAAs among the different types of water samples. Principal component analysis suggested that rainwater and recent uses of PFAAs could be the major sources of PFAAs in confined aquifers, while recent and current uses of PFAAs could be the major source of PFAAs in unconfined aquifers, rivers and coastal waters.

In addition, serum was isolated from these mice in order to assess their levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies. In all studies, levels of the cytokines of the antibodies were quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot. The results here showed that IL-2 and IFNγ formation was reduced, but that IL-4 production increased by the 5 and 20 mg PFOS/kg/d treatments. Serum IgM levels decreased significantly (in dose-related manner) as a result of the PFOS exposures; serum IgG levels increased markedly with 5 mg PFOS/kg/d, but decreased slightly with the 20 mg PFOS/kg/d regimens PFOS exposure increased serum corticosterone levels in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that, after a high-dose short-term exposure to PFOS, a host's immune state is likely to be characterized by a shift toward a more TH2-like state that, in turn, may lead to suppression of their cellular response and enhancement of their humoral response. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",NA,10.3109/1547691X.2010.537287,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Fluorocarbons;Cytokines;Animals;Mice;environmental exposure;male;Male;nonhuman;animal experiment;controlled study;corticosterone;Environmental Pollutants;mouse;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;article;priority journal;animal cell;gamma interferon;interleukin 4;spleen cell;immunomodulation;immunotoxicity;Perfluorooctanesulfonate;humoral immunity;Mus;Spleen;antibody;immunoglobulin G antibody;immunoglobulin M antibody;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;C57BL 6 mouse;interleukin 10;interleukin 2;cytokine release;Inbred C57BL;Administration;host resistance;immune status;Oral;T-helper cells;Th1 cell;Th1 Cells;Th2 cell;Th2 Cells;Type-1 cytokine;Type-2 cytokine,NA,NA

Such measurements can, e.g., help to further constrain oceanic and biospheric net fluxes or to differentiate between the gross biospheric fluxes photosynthesis and respiration. The 2041-2047 nm (about 4885-4900 cm(-1)) spectral region contains separated absorption lines of the three most abundant CO2 isotopologues. Their spectral properties make this spectral region well suited for the use of a light path proxy method for the retrieval of delta C-13 and delta O-18 (the ratio of heavier to lighter isotopologues relative to a standard). An optimal estimation based light path proxy retrieval for delta C-13 and delta O-18 has been set up, applicable to GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite) and ground-based FTS (Fourier transform spectrometer) measurements. Initial results show that it is possible to retrieve delta C-13 and delta O-18 from ground-based FTS instruments with a precision of 0.6-1.6 parts per thousand and from GOSAT with a precision of about 30 parts per thousand. Comparison of the achievable precision with the expected atmospheric signals shows that ground-based FTS remote sensing measurements have the potential to gain valuable information on delta C-13 and delta O-18 if averaging a sufficient number of measurements. It seems unlikely that this applies also to GOSAT because of the lower precision and a conceptual larger sensitivity to scattering related errors in satellite viewing geometry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, how lipid biosynthesis is regulated is not well understood in many species including Eutreptiella from the phylum of Euglenozoa. Here, we characterized the fatty acid (FA) profile of an Eutreptiella species isolated from Long Island Sound, USA, using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) and investigated their biosynthesis pathways by transcriptome sequencing. We discovered 24 types of FAs including a relatively high proportion of long-chain unsaturated FAs. The abundances of C16, C18, and saturated FAs decreased when phosphate in the culture medium was depleted. Among the 24 FAs, docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 (increment 4,7,10,13,16,19)) was most abundant, suggesting that Eutreptiella sp. preferentially invests in the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PFAs). Further transcriptomic analysis revealed that Eutreptiella sp. likely synthesizes LC-PFAs via increment 8 pathway and uses type I and II fatty acid synthases. Using RT-qPCR, we found that some of the lipid synthesis genes, such as beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, fatty acid desaturase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acyl carrier protein, increment 8 desaturase, and Acyl-ACP thioesterase, were more actively expressed during light period, and two carbon fixation genes were up-regulated in the high-lipid illuminated cultures, suggesting a linkage between photosynthesis and lipid production. The lipid profile renders Eutreptiella sp. a nutritional prey and valuable source for nutraceuticals, and the biosynthesis pathway documented here will be useful for future research and applications.",NA,10.1111/jpy.13105,"Fatty Acids;Gene Expression Profiling;Transcriptome;Unsaturated;Fatty Acids, Unsaturated",NA,NA

Exploring the co-occurrence and correlations of PFASs and cVOCs is a key step towards the understanding their distributions in the field. In this study, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant compound in groundwater and aquifer solids, and elevated concentrations of short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and hexafluoropropylene oxide oligomers were also detected in the field, suggesting their wide applications as substitutes for PFOA. Correlation analyses between PFASs and cVOCs suggested that cVOCs had a significant influence on the distribution and composition of PFASs in the field. In addition, the presence of cVOCs in the form of dense non-aqueous-phase organic liquids (DNAPL) affected the distribution and migration of PFASs at various depths, as evidenced by the relatively high PFASs concentrations (204 μg/L) and PFOA abundance (85.4%) in the deep aquifer, likely due to DNAPL-water interfaces sorption or partition into bulk DNAPL. The log Kd values, determined in the laboratory, were found to increase in the presence of DNAPL, especially for PFOA, with more than one time higher than those of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA). This conclusion further demonstrated that PFOA had a higher potential to participate into DNAPL, which can migrate with DNAPL to the deep aquifer, supporting the higher abundance of PFOA in the deep aquifer mentioned above. However, the log Kd-field values of PFBA and HFPO-DA in the field were higher than that of PFOA, and no significant correlations (p > 0.05) were found between log Kd-field values and the chain-length of PFCAs at various depths, suggesting that the phenomena observed in the field are a result of composite influencing factors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152814,Fluorocarbons;PFASs;Article;Environmental Monitoring;China;fluorocarbon;unclassified drug;environmental monitoring;Polyfluoroalkyl substances;water pollutant;perfluorooctanoic acid;pollution monitoring;concentration (composition);perfluoroalkyl substance;hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid;organofluorine derivative;polyfluoroalkyl substance;Laboratories;laboratory;perfluorobutanoic acid;ground water;Groundwater;organic compound;aquifer;Aquifers;Groundwater resources;pollution transport;Gas chromatography;Fluorochemical industrial park;industrial area;Industrial parks;Phase interfaces;groundwater;Water Pollutants;Fluorochemicals;Chemical;laboratory method;volatile organic compound;HFPO-TA;perfluoroalkylcarboxylic acid;Distribution coefficient;water chemistry;Aqueous phasis;chlorinated volatile organic compound;Dense non-aqueous-phase organic liquid;dense nonaqueous phase organic liquid;Distribution coefficients;DNAPL;field study;fluorochemical industrial park;laboratory technique;Non-aqueous;Organic liquid;Volatile organic compounds;Volatile Organic Compounds,NA,NA

PFAS were discovered accidentally over 70 years ago by a DuPont scientist and are found in various applications: cookware, food packaging, metal plating, leather and textile coatings, pesticides, paints, aviation hydraulic fluids, and fire-fighting (aqueous film-forming) foams. PFAS are an area of concern as their structural stability and ability to resist biodegradation enable their bioaccumulation in exposed organisms and biomagnification across food webs. The ability of PFAS to remain stable in the environment coupled with their known toxicity in invertebrate and vertebrate taxa has led to the characterization of some PFAS as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). As a result, there is concern for the health of both wildlife and human populations from direct or inadvertent exposures to PFAS. In this project, I assessed the levels of eleven select PFASs categorized as priority pollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in various drinking water sources across the Texas A&M University at Galveston (TAMUG) campus and in the final effluent of the campus’ wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Of the PFASs monitored, 73% were detected above the detection limits of the LC-MS/MS used to quantify PFAS levels. The levels of select PFAS (i.e. PFOA and PFOS) obtained in the samples were found to be 172 and 826 times lower than state and federal levels. Therefore, we can conclude that the levels of PFAS detected in the drinking waters at TAMUG and in surrounding surface waters are well below state mandated regulatory levels of concern.",NA,NA,PFAS;PFOS;Texas;Drinking;drinking water;PFOA;contaminant,NA,NA

The PFCs which were reported most frequently by the laboratories, and assessed with the most satisfactory agreement, were perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).

This shows that relative good agreement between laboratories was obtained for the study of standard and human matrices. For the fish extract, most laboratories underestimated the actual PFOS concentration due to matrix effects. The results for the fish tissue and water are also poor, indicating that the extraction and cleanup steps require further improvement.

Here, we combine PFAS exposure and bioaccumulation patterns with whole organism responses and omics-based ecosurveillance methods to investigate the potential impacts of PFAS on a top predator of wetlands, the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus). Tiger snakes (18 male and 17 female) were collected from four wetlands with varying PFAS chemical profiles and concentrations in Perth, Western Australia. Tiger snake livers were tested for 28 known PFAS compounds, and Σ28PFAS in liver tissues ranged between 322 ± 193 μg/kg at the most contaminated site to 1.31 ± 0.86 μg/kg at the least contaminated site. The dominant PFAS compound detected in liver tissues was PFOS. Lower body condition was associated with higher liver PFAS, and male snakes showed signs of high bioaccumulation whereas females showed signs of maternal offloading. Biochemical profiles of snake muscle, fat (adipose tissue), and gonads were analysed using a combination of liquid chromatography triple quadrupole (QqQ) and quadrupole time-of-flight (QToF) mass spectrometry methodologies. Elevated PFAS was associated with enriched energy production and maintenance pathways in the muscle, and had weak associations with energy-related lipids in the fat tissue, and lipids associated with cellular genesis and spermatogenesis in the gonads. These findings demonstrate the bioavailability of urban wetland PFAS in higher-order reptilian predators and suggest a negative impact on snake health and metabolic processes. This research expands on omics-based ecosurveillance tools for informing mechanistic toxicology and contributes to our understanding of the impact of PFAS residue on wildlife health to improve risk management and regulation. © 2023",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165260,Biochemistry;Female;Fluorocarbons;Humans;PFOS;Animals;Article;Bioaccumulation;animal;environmental exposure;female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;unclassified drug;animal experiment;controlled study;sex difference;bioaccumulation;predator;animal tissue;bioavailability;Health risks;lipid;Lipids;Histology;Liquid chromatography;Mass spectrometry;Muscle;concentration (composition);pollution exposure;adult;surfactant;wildlife;liquid chromatography;liver tissue;muscle;human;ecotoxicology;organofluorine derivative;metabolism;Australia;adipose tissue;Metabolism;time of flight mass spectrometry;body constitution;lipidomics;Lipidomics;perfluoroalkyl;metabolomics;Metabolomics;Western Australia;Liver tissue;Risk management;spermatogenesis;animal health;gonad;wetland;health impact assessment;polyfluoroalkyl;'omics';Wetlands;Elapidae;energy yield;Environmental metabolic profiling;metabolic fingerprinting;Metabolic profiling;Multi-omic;Multi-omics;multiomics;Non-model ecotox;Notechis scutatus;Perth [Western Australia];risk management;snake;Urban wetlands,NA,NA

One of the challenges in PFOA and PFOS analysis is the separation of linear and branched isomers that have the same mass-to-charge ratio but can have different toxicological properties. Current methods that are used for separating isomeric PFAS require relatively long analysis times (min to h) that can limit throughput. An emerging technique for the direct analysis of isomeric compounds is differential mobility spectrometry (DMS), which can rapidly separate gas phase ions prior to detection by mass spectrometry (MS). However, an ion mobility-based method for the analysis of PFAS has not been reported in the literature. Herein, high-resolution DMS-MS is used to separate and detect isomeric PFAS compounds for the first time in a separation process that occurs in milliseconds. The resolution of isomeric peaks increased by over 200% and 500% for PFOA and PFOS isomers, respectively, using a DMS carrier gas composed of 50:50% He:N 2 by volume compared to 100% N 2 , which was crucial in the separation of PFAS isomers under these conditions. Linear, secondary-branched, and tertiary-branched isomers of PFOA and PFOS including those that differ by the position of a single perfluoromethyl group can be resolved by DMS-MS. The DMS compensation field required to transmit different isomers increases as the extent of branching increases. For isomeric PFASs with a single branching point, the compensation field for optimal transmission also increases as the perfluoromethyl group is positioned closer to the carboxylate and sulfonate groups under these conditions. These results indicate that high-resolution DMS-MS should be a useful approach for the rapid analysis of isomeric PFAS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",NA,10.1016/j.aca.2019.01.038,Article;Carboxylation;Perfluorooctane sulfonates;Chromatography;unclassified drug;controlled study;nitrogen;Organic pollutants;Mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;perfluorooctanoic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;mass spectrometry;separation technique;priority journal;Water pollution;Ions;chemical composition;chemical reaction;organic compound;Isomers;isomer;Persistent organic pollutant (POP);Separation;Water quality;Quality control;dispersion;Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;Ion mobility spectrometers;Ion mobility-mass spectrometry;Ion mobility spectrometry;5 dimethylhexanesulfonic acid;5 dimethylhexanoic acid;collisionally activated dissociation;Differential ion mobility spectrometry;Differential mobility spectrometries;Field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry;helium;high resolution differential ion mobility mass spectrometry;higher energy collisional dissociation;Hyphenated chromatography;Isobaric separation;nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry;perfluoro 4 methylheptanesulfonic acid;perfluoro 4 methylheptanoic acid;perfluoro 5;perfluoro 6 methylheptanesulfonic acid;perfluoro 6 methylheptanoic acid;Perfluoro-compounds;Isomerism;Mass Spectrometry,NA,NA

This review summarizes and discusses the patterns and trends of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury in ringed seals ( Pusa hispida ) and polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ) in the Eastern Canadian Arctic relative to the rest of the Canadian Arctic. The review provides explanations for these trends and looks at the implications of climate-related changes on contaminants in these marine mammals in a region that has been reviewed little. Presently, the highest levels of total mercury (THg) and the legacy pesticide HCH in ringed seals and polar bears are found in the Western Canadian Arctic relative to other locations. Whereas, highest levels of some legacy contaminants, including ∑ PCBs, PCB 153, ∑ DDTs, p,p′ -DDE, ∑ CHLs, ClBz are found in the east (i.e., Ungava Bay and Labrador) and in the Beaufort Sea relative to other locations. The highest levels of recent contaminants, including PBDEs and PFOS are found at lower latitudes. Feeding ecology (e.g., feeding at a higher trophic position) is shaping the elevated levels of THg and some legacy contaminants in the west compared to the east. Spatial and temporal trends for POPs and THg are underpinned by historical loadings of surface ocean reservoirs including the Western Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. Trends set up by the distribution of water masses across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are then acted upon locally by on-going atmospheric deposition, which is the dominant contributor for more recent contaminants. Warming and continued decline in sea ice are likely to result in further shifts in food web structure, which are likely to increase contaminant burdens in marine mammals. Monitoring of seawater and a range of trophic levels would provide a better basis to inform communities about contaminants in traditionally harvested foods, allow us to understand the causes of contaminant trends in marine ecosystems, and to track environmental response to source controls instituted under international conventions.",NA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.052,Physiology;Bioaccumulation;Climate change;Mammals;Marine mammals;Food chains;the environment;Organic compounds &amp;Canada;Military Personnel,NA,NA

It is believed that the pituitary hormone prolactin plays an important role in such allocation processes. Incubation does not solely imply the active warming of the eggs but also the active egg-turning to facilitate absorption of albumen by the embryo, reduce malposition and prevent the embryo from adhering to the inner shell membrane. However, how prolactin secretion is related to egg-turning behaviors is presently poorly addressed. In addition, several environmental contaminants can affect parental care behaviors through their endocrine disrupting properties but the effects of such contaminants on egg-turning behaviors remain so far unexplored. Using artificial eggs equipped with miniaturized data loggers, we investigated the relationships between egg-turning behaviors, prolactin secretion and contaminants burden in Arctic black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Specifically, we examined the relationships between blood concentrations of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organochlorines (OCs), mercury (Hg), plasma prolactin levels and both egg-turning frequency and angular change. We also incorporated baseline corticosterone levels since this glucocorticoid is known to affect parental care. Plasma prolactin levels were positively related to angular change in female kittiwakes while corticosterone was not related to egg-turning behaviors in either sex. Hg was not related to egg-turning behaviors in either sex. We found contrasting associations between OCs and PFASs, since polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were negatively associated with angular change in females, contrary to linear perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOSlin) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) which were positively related to egg-turning frequency and angular change in both sexes. Additionally, PFASs concentrations were positively related to prolactin levels in female kittiwake. The possible stimulation of prolactin secretion by PFASs could therefore make adult kittiwakes to allocate more time taking care of their eggs, and thus possibly modify the trade-off between spending enough time caring for the clutch and obtaining enough nutrients at sea. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",NA,10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113420,Alkanesulfonic Acids;Female;Fluorocarbons;Rissa tridactyla;Black-legged kittiwake;Animals;Article;Perfluoroalkyl substances;Ovum;Prolactin;Mercury;Hydrocarbons;animal;Arctic;Arctic Regions;Charadriiformes;concentration (parameter);female;fluorocarbon;male;Male;nonhuman;seabird;unclassified drug;controlled study;corticosterone;Corticosterone;organochlorine derivative;polychlorinated biphenyl;Environmental Pollutants;pollutant;perfluorooctanesulfonic acid;chlorinated hydrocarbon;adult;alkanesulfonic acid;perfluoroalkyl substance;blood level;organofluorine derivative;perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid;priority journal;blood;mercury;animal cell;pollution;physiology;animal behavior;artificial egg;contaminated animal;correlation analysis;corticosterone blood level;egg turning behavior;Egg-loggers;Environmental Pollution;geography;Geography;Incubation behaviors;kittiwake;nutrient;Organochlorine compounds;ovum;parental behavior;prolactin;prolactin blood level;prolactin release;sea;Chlorinated,NA,NA

Here we report a method for the determination of (C2-C9) PFCAs by preparing the 2,4-difluoroanilides of the acids and analyzing by using GC-MS. Detector response was linear over the range 0.1-1000 pg of each perfluoroalkyl anilide. A complete suite of PFCAs can be analyzed in an individual sample with the PFCAs detected at levels similar to or lower than those determined by other methods. For a comparison between the present method and the more common LC-MS/MS method, 10 replicates of a sewage treatment plant discharge were analyzed for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) using both methods. Results were nearly identical with low standard deviation (GC-MS 30.9 ± 1.88 ng/L; while the LC-MS/MS 34.7 ± 3.05 ng/L). PFCA concentrations for water samples collected from depth profiles in mid-Lake Ontario were analyzed by GC-MS with most PFCAs (C2-C8) present above the detection limit (0.5 ng/L). Major PFCAs were trifluoroacetate (TFA) (100 ng/L) and perfluorobutanoate (PFBA) (> 5 ng/L). Results for PFOA (2.5 ng/L) were in good agreement with recent analyses by LC-MS/MS. PFCAs were also detected in the precipitation samples at concentrations lower than those of the samples from the lake profiles or sewage treatment plants (STPs) effluent. Since PFOA levels may be less than the lower detection limit (<0.5 ng/L) in 1 L samples, a method for large volumes using XAD-7 resin was developed that allows detection to 0.01 ng/L This method was applied to Lake Superior samples which produced good agreement for C6-C9 PFCAs between regular analysis (GC-MS) and the XAD-7 followed by GC-MS analysis. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",NA,10.1021/es061131o,Fluorocarbons;Surface waters;Environmental Monitoring;Carboxylic Acids;Canada;Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry;unclassified drug;comparative study;perfluoro compound;Mass spectrometry;perfluorooctanoic acid;water pollution;liquid chromatography;mass spectrometry;gas chromatography;water sampling;article;carboxylic acid;Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA);Great Lakes;perfluorobutanoate;Carboxylic acids;lake water;Reproducibility of Results;extraction;North America;Gas chromatography;Negative ions;trifluoroacetic acid;surface water;Water analysis;Lake Ontario;Water Pollutants;anion;Chemical;2;sewage treatment;sewage treatment plant;resin;precipitation;Precipitation (chemical);Precipitation;4 difluoroanilide;anilide;Anions;Perfluoroalkyl anilide;perflurocarboxylic acid;precipitation assessment;Standard deviation;Multiple Sclerosis,NA,NA

In addition to the muscles and livers of 8 types of fish and other tissues of silver carp, grass carp and mandarin fish were also collected. UPLC-MS/MS was used to analyze the content of 13 PFASs in different tissues of fish. The results showed that PFOS and PFOA were the predominant PFASs in the fish of Dongting Lake. Concentrations of ∑PFASs in muscles ranged from 3.64 to 31.27 ng·g-1 (dry weight, dw). Compared with other domestic lakes, the pollution level of PFASs in Dongting Lake fish was low. PFASs were distributed in a tissue-specific and species-specific manner in fish. In silver carp, the total concentration of PFASs decreased in the order of eye > liver > kidney > spleen > gall-bladder > intestine > gonad > muscle > bladder > skin, while in grass carp ∑PFASs decreased in the order of gall-bladder > kidney > brain > liver > muscle > skin > eye > gill > intestinal > bladder. At the same time, in mandarin fish, ∑PFASs decreased in the order of liver > stomach > kidney > intestinal > eye > skin > muscle > gill. The concentration of PFOA had a significant negative correlation with the δ15N values while the concentration of PFOS and PFUnDA had a positive correlation with the δ15N values in muscle of fish.The health risks PFOS and PFOA, assessed by average daily intake (ADI) were below the human tolerable daily intake (TDI), indicating there was no significant risk to human health. © 2021, Science Press.

PFOA persists in the environment and is found in wildlife and humans. In mice, PFOA is developmentally toxic producing mortality, delayed eye opening, growth deficits, and altered pubertal maturation. PFOA activates peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), a pathway critical to the mode of induction of liver tumors in rodents. The present study uses 129S1/SvlmJ wild-type (WT) and PPARα knockout (KO) mice to determine if PPARα mediates PFOA-induced developmental toxicity. Pregnant mice were dosed orally from gestation days 1-17 with water or 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 mg PFOA/kg. PFOA did not affect maternal weight, embryonic implantation, number, or weight of pups at birth. At 5 mg/kg, the incidence of full litter resorptions increased in both WT and KO mice. In WT, but not KO, neonatal survival was reduced (0.6 mg/kg) and eye opening was delayed (1 mg/kg). There was a trend across dose for reduced pup weight (WT and KO) on several postnatal days (PND), but only WT exposed to 1 mg/kg were significantly different from control (PND7-10 and 22). Maternal factors (e.g., background genetics) did not contribute to differences in postnatal mortality, as PFOA induced postnatal mortality in heterozygous pups born to WT or KO dams. In conclusion, early pregnancy loss was independent of PPARα expression. Delayed eye opening and deficits in postnatal weight gain appeared to depend on PPARα expression, although other mechanisms may contribute. PPARα was required for PFOA-induced postnatal lethality and expression of one copy of the gene was sufficient to mediate this effect. © The Author 2007.

Thus, we present and discuss the current state on studies involving amphibians and plastic particles, based on a broad approach to studies published in the last 5 years. To search for the articles, the ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were consulted, using different descriptors related to the topic of study. After the systematic search, we identified 848 publications. Of these, 12 studies addressed the relationship ""plastic particles and amphibians"" (7 studies developed in the laboratory and 5 field studies). The scientometric analysis points to geographic concentration of studies in Brazil and China; low investment in research in the area, and limited participation of international authors in the studies carried out. In the systematic approach, we confirm the scarcity of available data on the toxicity of plastic particles in amphibians; we observed a concentration of studies in the Anura order, only one study explored the toxicological effects of NPs and polystyrene and polyethylene are the most studied plastic types. Moreover, the laboratory tested concentrations are distant from those of the environmentally relevant; and little is known about the mechanisms of action of NPs/MPs involved in the identified (eco)toxicological effects. Thus, we strongly recommend more investments in this area, given the ubiquitous nature of NPs/MPs in aquatic environments and their possible consequences on the dynamics, reproduction, and survival of species in the natural environment.

The molecular formula was established to be C16H19Br3O by gas chromatography with electron ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/EI-HRMS). GC/EI-MS data were virtually identical with a polybrominated hexahydroxanthene derivative (PBHD) previously isolated from an Australian sponge species known to occur in the Mediterranean Sea as well. A tetrabromo isomer (TetraBHD) was also found in the fish samples. The concentrations of TriBHD and other halogenated compounds in commercial fish (sea bass, gilt head bream, anchovy, sardine, and salmon) were estimated with GC/electron capture detection (ECD). Using the ECD response of trans-nonachlor, the concentration of TriBHD reached up to 90 ng/g lipid weight and accounted for up to > 90% of the concentration of p,p'-DDE, which was the most abundant peak in the most samples investigated. On the basis of the GC/ECD response, TetraBHD amounted for similar to 1/7 of TriBHD in all fish samples investigated. The sample with the highest content was a green-lipped mussel from New Zealand (236 ng/g lipid weight). The halogenated natural products TBA, Q1, and MHC-1 were also present in most of the samples. We assume that the bulk of the residues in fish from aquaculture may originate from algae and sponges living in proximity of the fish farms. Detection of TriBHD and TetraBHD in blubber of a monk seal (Monachus monachus) suggests that both HNPs may reach the top predators of food webs and thus also humans.",NA,10.1021/jf052673c,Military Personnel,NA,NA

Due to their complex types and large differences in risk and toxicity, research based on the comprehensive assessment of the pollution characteristics to determine the new priority pollutants remains incomplete. This study established a multi-criterion scoring method targeting 41 emerging pollutants with the goal of protecting aquatic organisms and human health, using five key indicators including environmental exposure level, persistence, bioaccumulation, ecological risk, and health risk of pollutants. The emerging pollutants were screened and identified in the surface water of Tianjin. The priority levels of different congeners were divided, and the ecological and health risks of pollutants in the priority control list were evaluated. The results showed that 41 emerging pollutants were generally detected in the study area. The average concentration of sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) and other drugs (Others) were the largest, with 200.04 ng·L- 1 and 176.30 ng·L- 1, respectively, followed by perfluorinated compounds (PFASs, 57.98 ng·L- 1 ). In terms of pollutant categories, high-priority emerging pollutants were dominated by PFASs, accounting for 50%. Medium-priority emerging pollutants were still dominated by PFASs (26.32%), but the proportion was lower. Low-priority emerging pollutants were dominated by SAs, accounting for 31.25%. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CAF), perfluorohexyl sulfonic acid (PFHxA), and clarithromycin (CLA) were defined as a priority control list. Compared with other pollutants, PFOS and PFOA had higher scores in persistence, bioaccumulation, and health risk, whereas CBZ and CAF had higher scores in ecological risk. The average risk quotient (RQ) of CAF was 4.8, which indicated a relatively high ecological risk. Health risk indicated that the potential risk caused by PFOA (average hazard quotient was 0.018) cannot be ignored. For the priority control list, because of the high removal rate of CAF in sewage treatment plants, the construction of a pipe network and riverside belt with high vegetation coverage should be strengthened to reduce the impact of untreated sewage discharge and rainfall runoff. Pollutants with low removal rates in sewage treatment plants should be treated with combined technologies to improve the removal efficiency. In addition, industry substitution work should be accelerated to reduce emissions of PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxA. © 2022 Science Press.

Considering the three matrices, perfluoropentanoate (PFPeA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were the most frequent compounds, being remarkable the high occurrence of short-chain PFASs (C≤8), which are intended to replace the long-chain ones in several industrial and commercial applications. In general, all samples were contaminated with at least one PFAS, with the exception of three fish samples. Mean concentrations detected in sediments (0.22-11.5 ng g-1) and biota (0.63-274 μg kg-1) samples were higher than those measured in water (0.04-83.1 ng L-1), which might suggest (bio) accumulation. The occurrence of PFAS is related to urban and industrial discharges (Cuenca city in the upper part of basin, and car's factory, and effluents of the sewage treatment plant (STP) of Alzira, in the lower part). Increasing pollution gradients were found. On the other hand, higher contamination levels were observed after regulation dams of the catchment pointing out their importance in the re-distribution of these contaminants. None of the hazard quotients (HQ) calculated indicate potential risk for the different tropic levels considered (algae, Daphnia sp. and fish).

To date, no clear or consistent associations with contaminants measured in fish tissue or surface water have been found. Therefore, plasma samples from two sites in the Potomac River and two in the Susquehanna River drainage basins, differing in land-use characteristics, were utilized to determine if perfluoroalkyl substances were present. Four compounds, perfluorooctane sulphonic acid (PFOS), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA), were detected in every fish. Two additional compounds, perfluorooctane sulphonamide (PFOSA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), were less commonly detected at lower concentrations, depending on the site. Concentrations of PFOS (up to 574 ng/mL) were the highest detected and varied significantly among sites. No seasonal differences (spring versus fall) in plasma concentrations were observed. Concentrations of PFOS were not significantly different between the sexes. However, PFUnA and PFDoA concentrations were higher in males than females. Both agricultural and developed land-use appeared to be associated with exposure. Further research is needed to determine if these compounds could be affecting the health of smallmouth bass and identify sources. © 2021 by the authors.
